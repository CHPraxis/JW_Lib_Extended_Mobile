00:01.417 --> 00:05.689
And so we’re talking about technology today. 


00:05.688 --> 00:07.690
And as has been mentioned 


00:07.690 --> 00:09.525
by our commenters, 


00:09.525 --> 00:12.395
Jehovah’s organization is certainly making 


00:12.395 --> 00:15.965
good, positive use of technology 


00:15.965 --> 00:18.167
to get the good news preached. 


00:18.167 --> 00:21.972
Every week, 
we receive letters of appreciation 


00:21.972 --> 00:26.575
from those who have been watching JWB
—JW Broadcasting. 


00:26.575 --> 00:29.578
They just love to watch the programs. 


00:29.578 --> 00:32.415
And this morning, 
I’d like to talk a little bit more 


00:32.415 --> 00:36.585
about our website
—jw.org. 


00:36.585 --> 00:39.922
Did you know that many people 


00:39.922 --> 00:43.660
are first recognizing the sound of the truth 


00:43.660 --> 00:45.862
through jw.org 


00:45.862 --> 00:49.799
even before they have had 
personal contact with a Jehovah’s Witness? 


00:49.798 --> 00:51.801
It’s true. 


00:51.802 --> 00:54.904
I’d like to share some experiences 
with you this morning.


00:54.903 --> 00:57.773
The first one has to do with Cadja. 


00:57.773 --> 01:01.043
She was dissatisfied with her church, 


01:01.043 --> 01:05.248
and so she decided 
to investigate various religions. 


01:05.248 --> 01:07.250
Now in the old days, 


01:07.250 --> 01:10.018
people would just go 
from one church to the other, 


01:10.018 --> 01:13.456
but modern-day people 
go on the website; 


01:13.457 --> 01:17.060
and they want to know 
what various churches teach. 


01:17.060 --> 01:21.330
And as she was investigating 
the teaching of various religions, 


01:21.330 --> 01:23.800
she noticed that there were 
a lot of negative comments 


01:23.800 --> 01:25.902
about Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


01:25.902 --> 01:28.037
Did that stop her? 


01:28.037 --> 01:30.874
No, because she was a fair-minded person. 


01:30.873 --> 01:35.076
So she went online and found our website, 


01:35.077 --> 01:37.114
and she found 


01:37.113 --> 01:41.283
the “Frequently Asked Questions” section 
of the website, 


01:41.283 --> 01:43.285
and she loved it. 


01:43.285 --> 01:47.057
Every question was answered with the Bible, 


01:47.057 --> 01:50.059
and that’s what she wanted in a religion. 


01:50.058 --> 01:52.128
Well, she noticed on our website 


01:52.128 --> 01:55.231
that there was an invitation 
to attend our meetings. 


01:55.232 --> 01:59.002
And so she talked a schoolmate 
into going with her to the Kingdom Hall. 


01:59.002 --> 02:01.004
She was a schoolgirl. 


02:01.003 --> 02:04.673
Now, she loved what she heard 
at the Kingdom Hall, 


02:04.673 --> 02:07.676
and she was so warmly welcomed.


02:07.677 --> 02:09.679
But wouldn’t you know it? 


02:09.678 --> 02:12.381
Her parents were opposed. 


02:12.382 --> 02:16.585
And soon after she made 
that one foray to the Kingdom Hall, 


02:16.585 --> 02:18.955
they moved to an isolated area 


02:18.955 --> 02:21.690
where there were none 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


02:21.690 --> 02:26.195
and Cadja was cut off 
from any association 


02:26.195 --> 02:29.365
with the Witnesses for one year. 


02:29.365 --> 02:33.368
But not to be deterred, 


02:33.368 --> 02:38.106
she studied all of our publications 
on the website. 


02:38.107 --> 02:41.710
And she kept up-to-date with the truth. 


02:41.710 --> 02:44.013
In September of 2014, 


02:44.013 --> 02:47.216
she was again able to make contact 
with the Witnesses 


02:47.217 --> 02:49.352
and she accepted a Bible study. 


02:49.352 --> 02:53.557
And in July 2015, she was baptized. 


02:53.557 --> 02:55.559
So she got the truth. 


02:55.558 --> 03:00.463
Her initial contact 
with the truth was on jw.org.


03:00.463 --> 03:04.133
Now, speaking of being cut off 
from the Witnesses, 


03:04.133 --> 03:06.135
that’s Kenji’s problem. 


03:06.135 --> 03:08.705
He’s a fifteen-year-old boy in Japan. 


03:08.705 --> 03:11.908
He would love to attend meetings 
at the Kingdom Hall, 


03:11.908 --> 03:15.076
but his father 
forbids him from attending. 


03:15.077 --> 03:17.914
But here’s what Kenji has to say. 


03:17.913 --> 03:21.016
He says: “I watch JW Broadcasting 


03:21.017 --> 03:24.187
“and jw.org every day. 


03:24.187 --> 03:28.190
“I see brothers doing their best, 
and that encourages me. 


03:28.190 --> 03:31.727
“One day I will become a great brother. 


03:31.727 --> 03:34.497
Please wait.”


03:34.497 --> 03:36.765
Well, speaking of lifelines, 


03:36.765 --> 03:41.170
we were at a circuit assembly 
in St. Louis, Missouri, over the weekend, 


03:41.170 --> 03:43.172
and a sister told me 


03:43.172 --> 03:47.077
that she had been 
very gravely ill for a whole year


03:47.077 --> 03:49.912
—so ill that she 
couldn’t attend the meetings, 


03:49.912 --> 03:52.849
and she wasn’t able 
to tie in to the meetings. 


03:52.848 --> 03:54.883
But she said her lifeline 


03:54.883 --> 03:59.621
was JW Broadcasting and jw.org. 


03:59.622 --> 04:04.094
So these technological innovations 


04:04.093 --> 04:07.230
are really accomplishing a good work.


04:07.230 --> 04:09.298
Let’s talk about Alenka. 


04:09.298 --> 04:11.500
She’s a physics teacher. 


04:11.500 --> 04:14.870
And one day, 
she was at the home of an acquaintance


04:14.870 --> 04:18.373
and there was a strange man there
—a man that she didn’t know. 


04:18.373 --> 04:20.710
But she was really impressed with this man. 


04:20.710 --> 04:25.080
He was so friendly
—so warm and kind and balanced too. 


04:25.080 --> 04:28.618
And after he left, 
she mentioned that to the householder. 


04:28.618 --> 04:31.253
And the householder said: 
“It’s all true what you say. 


04:31.253 --> 04:33.255
“But there’s one problem. 


04:33.255 --> 04:35.257
He’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 


04:35.257 --> 04:38.027
Another negative comment 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


04:38.027 --> 04:40.029
What did she do? 


04:40.028 --> 04:42.531
She went home and she went online 


04:42.532 --> 04:45.369
and she found our website. 


04:45.368 --> 04:47.736
For five months, 


04:47.737 --> 04:52.642
she carefully studied 
all of the material on our website. 


04:52.642 --> 04:56.212
And at the end of five months, 
she decided to go to the Kingdom Hall. 


04:56.212 --> 04:59.882
She made a very interesting comment, 
something I hadn’t really thought about, 


04:59.882 --> 05:02.819
she said, 
“Thanks to jw.org, 


05:02.818 --> 05:05.655
“nothing in the hall 
seemed strange to me


05:05.655 --> 05:09.692
—the program, the people—
all of it was familiar.” 


05:09.692 --> 05:12.329
After she attended meetings for a month, 


05:12.328 --> 05:14.496
she asked for a Bible study. 


05:14.497 --> 05:17.967
So she was careful, 
but she got the truth, 


05:17.967 --> 05:22.505
and her first encounter 
after that man was our website.


05:22.505 --> 05:27.010
Dregan was a Franciscan monk in Slovenia. 


05:27.010 --> 05:29.212
He’d been in the order for a number of years, 


05:29.212 --> 05:31.214
but there was something missing. 


05:31.213 --> 05:32.615
There was a void in his life. 


05:32.615 --> 05:34.617
He realized that his religion 


05:34.617 --> 05:37.620
was not satisfying his spiritual need. 


05:37.620 --> 05:39.622
So he went online 


05:39.622 --> 05:43.459
and he joined a chat room 
with a bunch of evangelicals. 


05:43.458 --> 05:45.495
Well, as you can imagine, 


05:45.495 --> 05:49.865
eventually some negative comments 
were made about Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


05:49.865 --> 05:51.867
Did that stop Dregan? 


05:51.867 --> 05:55.137
No, another fair-minded person. 


05:55.137 --> 05:56.372
He thought, 


05:56.372 --> 06:00.677
‘It’s not fair to criticize 
Jehovah’s Witnesses when,’ 


06:00.677 --> 06:04.280
thankfully, ‘none of Jehovah’s Witnesses 
are in that chat room.’ 


06:04.280 --> 06:08.017
So he went online 
and found our website. 


06:08.017 --> 06:12.355
And he was delighted 
with the quality of the website. 


06:12.355 --> 06:14.357
Now, he was a monk, 


06:14.357 --> 06:18.160
and in the Franciscan Order, 
that particular Franciscan Order, 


06:18.160 --> 06:22.332
the monks were only allowed 
to leave the monastery on Mondays.


06:22.332 --> 06:27.270
So one day, he found the address 
of the branch office in Slovenia, 


06:27.270 --> 06:30.873
and on a Monday morning, 
he went to the branch and got a tour. 


06:30.873 --> 06:33.810
The brothers received him very warmly. 


06:33.810 --> 06:36.478
He was very impressed with what he saw, 


06:36.478 --> 06:40.315
and he came away with a novel idea. 


06:40.315 --> 06:42.318
He came away with the thought 


06:42.318 --> 06:46.421
that he should be reading 
the Bible every day. 


06:46.422 --> 06:49.359
And so he went back to the monastery,
went online,


06:49.358 --> 06:52.828
and started reading 
the Bible online every day. 


06:52.828 --> 06:55.396
His fellow monks observed this, 


06:55.397 --> 06:57.400
and they thought this was hilarious. 


06:57.400 --> 06:59.802
What’s a Catholic monk doing 
reading the Bible? 


06:59.802 --> 07:03.305
But he didn’t allow 
their opposition to deter him. 


07:03.305 --> 07:07.943
He kept reading the Bible 
and then kept consulting jw.org, 


07:07.943 --> 07:11.646
and he realized, 
on consulting the website, 


07:11.647 --> 07:15.485
that the Memorial that year 
was on a Monday. 


07:15.485 --> 07:19.955
So he was going to be able to attend, 
and he did. 


07:19.955 --> 07:24.060
And that did it
—that meeting. 


07:24.060 --> 07:27.363
He made the decision 
to leave the Catholic Church 


07:27.363 --> 07:29.965
and to leave the monastery. 


07:29.965 --> 07:32.868
So now, there were a lot 
of challenges to overcome. 


07:32.868 --> 07:35.705
It wasn’t so easy, 
but he persevered. 


07:35.705 --> 07:39.742
And in June of 2014, 
he left the church; 


07:39.742 --> 07:41.810
he left the monastery; 


07:41.810 --> 07:45.280
and then in the month of October 
of that same year, 


07:45.280 --> 07:48.317
he was baptized as one 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


07:48.317 --> 07:52.955
Since, he has served 
as an auxiliary pioneer.


07:52.955 --> 07:57.793
A sister in Finland is studying 
with a Bulgarian woman, 


07:57.793 --> 08:01.263
and one day the woman asked her 
to drive her to the hospital. 


08:01.263 --> 08:03.265
“Oh, are you ill?” 


08:03.265 --> 08:05.902
Well, the woman hemmed and hawed,
and finally she admitted 


08:05.902 --> 08:08.237
she wanted to have an abortion. 


08:08.237 --> 08:10.239
Well, the sister said: 
“I can’t. 


08:10.238 --> 08:13.475
My conscience won’t allow me 
to drive you to the hospital for that.” 


08:13.475 --> 08:15.945
And then she shared 
some scriptures with the woman 


08:15.945 --> 08:18.047
on God’s view of life. 


08:18.047 --> 08:20.049
But then she had an idea. 


08:20.048 --> 08:22.083
At the end of every study


08:22.083 --> 08:24.886
—and here is something 
that you might want to implement—


08:24.887 --> 08:26.889
at the end of every study, 


08:26.888 --> 08:30.025
she shows the woman 
something from the website. 


08:30.025 --> 08:32.027
And she remembered something. 


08:32.027 --> 08:36.732
Song number 88
—“Children Are a Trust From God”—


08:36.732 --> 08:39.869
had come out in the Bulgarian language 


08:39.868 --> 08:43.271
as sung by a children’s chorus. 


08:43.272 --> 08:48.277
So she played song 88 to the woman 
in the Bulgarian language. 


08:48.277 --> 08:53.282
The woman’s heart was touched, 
and she canceled the abortion. 


08:53.282 --> 08:55.852
She said: 
“I’m going to have the baby. 


08:55.852 --> 08:58.989
“If it’s a boy, his name will be Angel. 


08:58.988 --> 09:02.156
“If it’s a girl, Angelina


09:02.157 --> 09:05.729
because God protected the child.” 


09:05.728 --> 09:09.000
And I think the children’s chorus 
helped a little bit too.


09:11.167 --> 09:14.404
Now, we have for years 


09:14.403 --> 09:18.406
been encouraging pioneers 
and publishers who conduct Bible studies 


09:18.407 --> 09:20.577
to direct interest to the organization. 


09:20.577 --> 09:22.579
And we printed a brochure. 


09:22.578 --> 09:26.681
And then we printed 
a simplified brochure with many pictures. 


09:26.682 --> 09:29.852
And these brochures have had some success. 


09:29.852 --> 09:33.322
But I think what has really opened 
the eyes of the brothers 


09:33.322 --> 09:36.825
and our Bible students to the organization 


09:36.825 --> 09:40.830
has been JW Broadcasting and jw.org. 


09:40.830 --> 09:44.533
And you see now as you go 
from one congregation to another 


09:44.533 --> 09:46.535
or one circuit to another 


09:46.535 --> 09:48.837
that the brothers are really talking 
about the organization 


09:48.837 --> 09:51.240
as they never did before. 


09:51.240 --> 09:53.475
So it’s obvious that technology 


09:53.475 --> 09:57.313
has contributed 
to the understanding of the brothers 


09:57.313 --> 10:00.248
and to the spread of the good news.


10:00.248 --> 10:02.785
Now here’s a warning: 


10:02.785 --> 10:06.955
Technology has a place; 
it has a big place. 


10:06.955 --> 10:09.425
But there is a danger. 


10:09.425 --> 10:12.395
Have you ever heard the term “phubbing”? 


10:12.395 --> 10:13.695
“Phubbing.” 


10:13.695 --> 10:16.865
P-H-U-B-B-I-N-G. 


10:16.865 --> 10:21.470
It’s a combination of phone and snubbing, 


10:21.470 --> 10:25.273
and it refers to the act 
of ignoring real people 


10:25.273 --> 10:28.143
while consulting an electronic device. 


10:28.143 --> 10:30.545
So picture a man and a woman 
in a restaurant, 


10:30.545 --> 10:33.082
and each one is online. 


10:33.082 --> 10:37.554
Each one is consulting 
a different website or answering mail, 


10:37.553 --> 10:40.856
and they’re not talking to each other. 


10:40.857 --> 10:45.060
It’s a real problem 
according to a study by Baylor University. 


10:45.060 --> 10:48.163
So, what we want to do 
is stay connected, 


10:48.163 --> 10:50.198
not just to the Internet, 


10:50.198 --> 10:54.536
but to stay connected to real people, 
to those around us. 


10:54.537 --> 10:57.407
Brother John Barr of the Governing Body 
used to say 


10:57.407 --> 10:59.875
that if we shut out those around us 


10:59.875 --> 11:02.378
while consulting an electronic device, 


11:02.378 --> 11:06.248
we’re really not focusing 
on the sounds of life. 


11:06.248 --> 11:09.885
We are missing the sounds of life. 


11:09.885 --> 11:12.922
And we’re also missing out on opportunities 


11:12.922 --> 11:22.115
to strengthen our bond with others.

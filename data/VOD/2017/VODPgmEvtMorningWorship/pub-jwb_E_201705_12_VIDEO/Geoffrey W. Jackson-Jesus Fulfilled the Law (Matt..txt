00:01 In your ministry, have you ever met someone
00:04 who strongly believes that we are still
00:07 under the Ten Commandments?
00:09 Now, that can happen at times  because many people
00:12 —especially in the southern parts  of this country—
00:15 feel very strongly  about the Ten Commandments.
00:18 There are even legal battles going on
00:21 as to whether monuments  displaying the Ten Commandments
00:24 can be displayed  on government property.
00:27 And, of course, many people feel  that the Ten Commandments
00:31 are basically what was used  for the Constitution
00:35 and for the laws of many countries.
00:37 So at one point, perhaps,  a person might say to us,
00:41 ‘Do you believe that we are still  under the Ten Commandments?’
00:46 Perhaps you may diplomatically answer,
00:49 ‘Well, I believe we are under the principles  of the Ten Commandments
00:53 and the law of love —the law of the Christ.’
00:56 But a person may push  the point and say,
00:58 ‘But do you believe the Ten Commandments  are binding today?’
01:02 Well, when we give them  an explanation from the Scriptures,
01:06 perhaps they may feel disappointed  and maybe they realize
01:10 that there’s a verse in the Bible  that they feel supports their belief.
01:14 So let’s take our Bibles
01:16 and turn to Matthew chapter five, the Sermon on the Mount,
01:20 from which our text  is taken this morning.
01:23 And perhaps they may point
01:26 to verses 17 and 18.
01:29 Now that reads:
01:31 “Do not think I came to destroy  the Law or the Prophets.
01:35 “I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill.
01:39 “Truly I say to you that sooner  would heaven and earth pass away
01:43 “than for one stroke of a letter  to pass away from the Law
01:47 until all things take place.”
01:50 Now, this person,  in presenting their explanation,
01:54 may show that they believe  this expression “fulfilled”
01:57 means “established permanently.”
02:00 And even some Bible commentaries
02:03 say that this involves total commitment.
02:06 Well, how would you answer  the person at that stage?
02:10 How can we help them?
02:12 Perhaps you might take them  through a series of scriptures,
02:15 such as Romans 10:4  where it says:
02:18 “Christ is the end of the Law.”
02:20 You might read Galatians 4:4,5  where it says,
02:25 ‘those under the law were released.’
02:28 Or Ephesians 2:15 where it speaks  of the Law being “abolished.”
02:33 But if you’ve done that,
02:35 perhaps you’ve had  the same experience that I have
02:38 —that a person may agree  with those scriptures but say:
02:42 ‘That’s not referring  to the Ten Commandments.
02:46 ‘That’s referring to all the other laws  in the Mosaic Law arrangement.
02:50 But the Ten Commandments  remain forever.’
02:53 Well, how can you help someone  to reason on that matter?
02:58 Well, let’s look back again  at Matthew chapter 5,
03:02 and we notice there  in verses 17 and 18,
03:06 it mentions that Jesus came  “not to destroy, but to fulfill.”
03:10 And we could ask the person  how they understand the word “fulfill”
03:14 —what they feel that means.
03:16 And perhaps they might say,  ‘Established permanently.’
03:20 Well, then we could point out
03:22 that Jesus then continues to talk  about various aspects of the Law.
03:27 If we look at verse 21,  what do we notice?
03:30 “You heard that it was said  to those of ancient times:
03:34 ‘You must not murder.’”
03:36 So, yes, this is one  of the Ten Commandments.
03:40 Interestingly, the study Bible has a note  on this verse that says
03:44 this phrase,  “You heard that is was said:
03:47 “. . . can refer both to things stated  in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures
03:52 and to teachings of Jewish tradition.”
03:54 Now, we’ll see this as we go on.
03:57 If we go to verse 23,
03:59 what does it talk about here?
04:02 “If, then, you are bringing  your gift to the altar
04:05 and there you remember your brother  has something against you.”
04:09 This is not part  of the Ten Commandments, is it?
04:12 It’s talking about the arrangements  for sacrifices.
04:16 Then, if we look at verse 27:
04:19 “You heard that it was said:  ‘You must not commit adultery.’”
04:23 Well, again we have  the Ten Commandments.
04:26 But if we look at verse 31,  Jesus here says:
04:31 “Moreover, it was said:  ‘Whoever divorces his wife,
04:35 let him give her  a certificate of divorce.’”
04:38 That’s not one  of the Ten Commandments, is it?
04:41 Reading on further in verse 33,  it says:
04:45 “Again you heard that it was said  to those of ancient times:
04:48 ‘You must not swear without performing.’”
04:51 Again, not one  of the Ten Commandments.
04:54 Verse 38:  “You heard that it was said:
04:58 ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’”
05:01 Again, not one  of the Ten Commandments.
05:04 And then we come to the scripture  we’ve been considering this morning
05:08 in verse 43:
05:10 “You heard that it was said:
05:12 ‘You must love your neighbor  and hate your enemy.’”
05:16 Now, when we consider this
05:19 —we look at the study Bible notes  on this verse—
05:22 it makes this comment  about “hate your enemy.”
05:25 It says: “The Mosaic Law  contained no such command.
05:29 “Some Jewish rabbis believed  that the command to love their neighbor
05:32 implied that they should hate their enemy.”
05:36 So this wasn’t really part  of the Law that Moses gave.
05:41 But what do we see from this?
05:43 Well, if a person argues very strongly  that the word “fulfilled,”
05:48 when Jesus is talking about the Law,
05:50 applies to the Ten Commandments only
05:54 —we look down here— Jesus when he’s talking about the Law,
05:58 doesn’t just talk  about the Ten Commandments, does he?
06:00 He talks about all these things,  including even the oral tradition.
06:05 So if a person were to believe  that Jesus’ words, when saying “fulfilled,”
06:10 refer to absolutely establishing  something permanently,
06:15 would also feel —or have to feel—
06:18 that he’s referring to this law  of “eye for eye, tooth for tooth”
06:21 when, in fact, he showed  something better than that, didn’t he?
06:26 And the same too  with the scripture for today’s text.
06:29 So, what do we see here?
06:31 Well, we can’t make  that comment about Jesus’ words.
06:35 So, what does it mean  when it says,
06:37 ‘to fulfill and not to destroy’?
06:41 Perhaps a simple illustration  would help us.
06:44 If someone signs  a contract as a builder
06:48 to build a home  for someone else,
06:50 what does it mean  to destroy the contract?
06:54 Well, perhaps it means ripping it up,  burning it, getting rid of it
06:59 —certainly not building the house.
07:02 But on the other hand,  what does it mean
07:04 to fulfill the contract  to build the house?
07:08 Well, it means  that the person builds the house.
07:11 But once the house is built,
07:13 then the contract  is completed, or fulfilled.
07:18 This person isn’t under obligation  to continue over and over again
07:22 to keep building the same house.
07:24 So perhaps an illustration  such as that
07:27 may help someone  of humble heart
07:30 to see that when Jesus said
07:32 he “came, not to destroy,  but to fulfill,”
07:35 that he wasn’t there  to eradicate the Law.
07:38 In Galatians 4, it mentions  he was ‘born under Law.’
07:41 So he had to fulfill, or complete,  or do what the Law stated.
07:45 But, of course, the other scriptures  help us when they tell us
07:48 that the Law was completed,
07:51 that the Christ  was the end to the Law.
07:53 Now, perhaps a person  might still find this
07:56 a little difficult to comprehend.
07:59 One final scripture we could share with them
08:01 is in the book of Romans,
08:03 Romans 7:6, 7.
08:09 Romans 7:6, 7,  verse 6 says:
08:13 “But now we have been released  from the Law,
08:16 “because we have died to that which restrained us,
08:21 “in order that we might be slaves  in a new sense by the spirit
08:25 and not in the old sense  by the written code.”
08:28 Now, if we pause there,  perhaps the person might jump in and say:
08:32 ‘Ah, yes. That’s the Law  that doesn’t include the Ten Commandments.
08:36 Those are all the other laws,  but the Ten Commandments remain forever.’
08:41 Well, then we ask them,   ‘Just let’s read on, verse 7,
08:44 what does it say?’
08:46 “What, then, are we to say?
08:48 “Is the Law sin?
08:50 “Certainly not!
08:52 “Really, I would not have come  to know sin
08:55 “had it not been for the Law.
08:57 For example, . . .”
08:59 Now, what example  is Paul going to use?
09:02 It says: “For example,  I would not have known covetousness
09:06 if the Law had not said:  ‘You must not covet.’”
09:10 So, obviously, the apostle Paul  and our Lord Jesus Christ
09:15 did not separate the Law  into two parts
09:18 —the Ten Commandments  and the other laws.
09:21 So we can see clearly from here  that we have a good answer
09:25 to give persons  when they adamantly state
09:28 that the Ten Commandments  are still binding.
09:30 Hopefully, we can go on then  to help them to see
09:33 that Jesus was teaching us  the principles behind the laws
09:37 and that “the law of the Christ”  involves loving Jehovah
09:41 and loving our neighbors,
09:43 and then following  what direction Jehovah has given us.
09:46 So you may think  this is quite a complicated subject
09:51 to discuss early in the morning.
09:54 But next time  when someone does ask you,
09:57 “Do you believe  the Ten Commandments are binding?”
10:00 hopefully, you’ll remember  these comments.

00:01.117 --> 00:03.787
“Their best one is like a brier, 


00:03.787 --> 00:05.955
“their most upright one 


00:05.955 --> 00:08.792
is worse than a thorn hedge.” 


00:08.792 --> 00:10.760
This is an example 


00:10.760 --> 00:13.497
of many agricultural metaphors 


00:13.497 --> 00:15.599
that Micah used in his writing. 


00:15.598 --> 00:17.733
But who was he talking about? 


00:17.733 --> 00:19.701
Why did he say this, 


00:19.702 --> 00:23.507
and what lesson 
can we take away from today’s text? 


00:23.507 --> 00:26.009
To find the historical setting, 


00:26.008 --> 00:28.243
it’s helpful to look 
at the “Table of the Books of the Bible” 


00:28.243 --> 00:30.613
that appears on page 1662 


00:30.613 --> 00:33.483
of the printed edition 
of our New World Translation.


00:33.483 --> 00:36.485
But if you’re using the JW Library app, 


00:36.485 --> 00:38.488
this is what you need to do. 


00:38.488 --> 00:40.690
Please follow along. 


00:40.690 --> 00:45.295
First, go to your home page for the Bible. 


00:45.295 --> 00:47.363
In the menu bar at the top, 


00:47.363 --> 00:51.333
you’ll see the word Introduction on the left. 


00:51.333 --> 00:53.368
At the bottom of the list that comes up, 


00:53.368 --> 00:56.873
you’ll see “Names and Order of the Books.” 


00:56.873 --> 00:58.875
Tap that. 


00:58.875 --> 01:00.877
And don’t be put off by the fact 


01:00.877 --> 01:03.647
that you’re only seeing 
the names in order of the books. 


01:03.647 --> 01:06.582
Rather, scroll all the way 
down to the bottom, 


01:06.582 --> 01:11.320
and there you will see 
“Table of the Books of the Bible.” 


01:11.320 --> 01:13.322
Tap that. 


01:13.322 --> 01:17.327
You can bookmark it if you’d like 
to get there faster the next time. 


01:17.327 --> 01:19.995
And then scroll down to Micah.


01:19.995 --> 01:23.065
What do we learn 
about the context of our day’s text? 


01:23.065 --> 01:25.368
It was written by Micah; we knew that. 


01:25.368 --> 01:26.803
Where was he? 


01:26.803 --> 01:28.070
In Judah. 


01:28.070 --> 01:30.107
When did he write this prophecy? 


01:30.107 --> 01:33.977
Sometime before the year 717 B.C.E. 


01:33.977 --> 01:36.312
And what time period does his writing cover? 


01:36.312 --> 01:41.017
The 60 years spanning from 777—717 B.C.E. 


01:41.017 --> 01:43.052
counting backwards toward the time of Jesus. 


01:43.052 --> 01:45.822
Now what was happening 
during those 60 years? 


01:45.822 --> 01:50.227
We have a chart 
in Appendix A6 that helps us.


01:50.227 --> 01:53.229
Again, 
if you’re following along in JW Library, 


01:53.228 --> 01:55.665
go to the upper left-hand corner 
of your screen 


01:55.665 --> 01:58.033
and tap the menu bar, 
“Names and Order”; 


01:58.033 --> 02:00.370
that is to say, 
go back. 


02:00.370 --> 02:04.640
There you’ll see toward the bottom 
of the list Appendix A. 


02:04.640 --> 02:06.742
Or you can always go back to the home page 


02:06.742 --> 02:09.112
and select Appendix A from the menu ribbon. 


02:09.112 --> 02:11.714
In any event, when you get to Appendix A, 


02:11.713 --> 02:14.550
you’ll see the option 
for “A6 Chart: 


02:14.550 --> 02:18.555
Prophets and Kings 
of Judah and of Israel.” 


02:18.555 --> 02:21.958
And remember, 
we’re looking for what life was like 


02:21.958 --> 02:25.461
during the 60 years 
between 777 and 717 B.C.E. 


02:25.462 --> 02:28.264
So likely, Part 2 would reveal 
what we’re looking for. 


02:28.263 --> 02:30.266
Tap Part 2. 


02:30.267 --> 02:32.435
There we find this beautiful chart.


02:32.435 --> 02:34.170
What does it tell us? 


02:34.170 --> 02:38.107
That Micah was a contemporary 
of Isaiah and Hosea 


02:38.107 --> 02:40.544
and that his service as a prophet in Judah 


02:40.543 --> 02:43.946
ran during the reigns of Jotham for 16 years, 


02:43.947 --> 02:47.517
wicked King Ahaz for 16 years, 


02:47.517 --> 02:53.624
but also most of Hezekiah’s 29-year reign. 


02:53.623 --> 02:57.993
Meanwhile, what was happening 
up in the northern ten-tribe kingdom? 


02:57.993 --> 03:00.230
Look at the chart again on the right 


03:00.230 --> 03:03.600
starting in 777 B.C.E. 


03:03.600 --> 03:06.668
Nineteen years are left of Pekah’s reign, 


03:06.668 --> 03:09.905
and then nine years of Hoshea’s rule, 


03:09.905 --> 03:12.442
but here things began to destabilize. 


03:12.442 --> 03:15.279
We see the Assyrian monarchy moving in 


03:15.278 --> 03:18.280
exerting its influence in Israel’s affairs. 


03:18.280 --> 03:20.283
And then, in 740 B.C.E., 


03:20.283 --> 03:24.420
it’s all over 
for the northern ten-tribe kingdom.


03:24.420 --> 03:28.257
Did those events 
have an influence on the south? 


03:28.257 --> 03:31.127
Certainly, it fed the Assyrians’ pride, 


03:31.127 --> 03:33.129
fueling their belief that they could come in 


03:33.128 --> 03:35.998
and overtake Judah in the same fashion. 


03:35.998 --> 03:38.366
And what do we know 
about Jotham, 


03:38.367 --> 03:41.337
Ahaz, and Hezekiah? 


03:41.337 --> 03:43.472
Well, it was during Jotham’s reign 


03:43.472 --> 03:46.209
that Judah began to experience 
military pressure 


03:46.208 --> 03:49.345
from an alliance between King Pekah 


03:49.345 --> 03:52.782
and King Rezin of Syria, 


03:52.782 --> 03:56.785
and that alliance would eventually 
weaken Judah’s defenses 


03:56.785 --> 03:59.455
and leave them open to brutal attacks 


03:59.455 --> 04:02.258
by the Edomites in the southeast 


04:02.258 --> 04:05.861
and the Philistines coming from the west.


04:05.862 --> 04:10.867
However, none of that humbled 
wicked King Ahaz. 


04:10.867 --> 04:14.437
He led a debauched life, 
he sought refuge with pagan rulers, 


04:14.437 --> 04:16.439
he adopted their way of worship, 


04:16.438 --> 04:18.675
and he even sacrificed his own sons 


04:18.675 --> 04:21.177
in the fire in the Valley of Hinnom. 


04:21.177 --> 04:26.182
No wonder Micah wrote what he did 
in the words of today’s text. 


04:26.182 --> 04:31.000
Let’s go back and read it now 
from Micah 7:2-4: 


04:33.022 --> 04:37.127
“The loyal one has perished from the earth; 


04:37.127 --> 04:41.864
“among men there is no one upright. 


04:41.863 --> 04:45.301
“All of them lie in ambush for bloodshed. 


04:45.302 --> 04:48.304
“Each hunts his own brother with a dragnet. 


04:48.303 --> 04:51.740
“Their hands are expert at doing what is bad; 


04:51.740 --> 04:55.177
“the prince is making demands, 


04:55.177 --> 04:58.247
“the judge asks for a reward,


04:58.247 --> 05:01.050
“the prominent one makes known his desires, 


05:01.050 --> 05:03.720
“and they work it out together. 


05:03.720 --> 05:07.290
“Their best one is like thorns, 


05:07.290 --> 05:09.892
“their most upright one 


05:09.892 --> 05:13.764
is worse than a thorn hedge.”


05:13.763 --> 05:16.698
So, what’s the meaning of the metaphor? 


05:16.698 --> 05:19.568
The topic: the unfaithful Israelites. 


05:19.568 --> 05:21.470
The image: 


05:21.470 --> 05:24.140
a patch of briers and thorns. 


05:24.140 --> 05:26.242
The point of similarity: 


05:26.242 --> 05:29.545
just as getting stuck in briers, 
or a thorn hedge, 


05:29.545 --> 05:31.880
injures anyone who walks into it, 


05:31.880 --> 05:36.685
these corrupt Israelites harmed 
anyone with whom they had dealings. 


05:36.685 --> 05:38.688
Now, how far did the corruption go? 


05:38.688 --> 05:41.090
Back in verse 2, 
it said it was all-pervasive. 


05:41.090 --> 05:44.227
There was no one, 
not even one who was upright. 


05:44.227 --> 05:48.030
Verse 3 indicated it reached 
the highest levels of society. 


05:48.030 --> 05:50.400
The prominent expressed their wishes, 


05:50.400 --> 05:53.803
the judges accepted bribes 
to carry out those wishes, 


05:53.803 --> 05:55.971
and they all were in cahoots. 


05:55.972 --> 05:58.975
They worked it out together.


05:58.975 --> 06:03.312
Now verse 3 says this included the prince. 


06:03.312 --> 06:06.549
Who would have been the prince 


06:06.548 --> 06:10.351
in the days of King Ahaz? 


06:10.352 --> 06:12.355
Hezekiah? 


06:12.355 --> 06:15.257
Might Micah have written those words 


06:15.257 --> 06:18.560
during the actual reign of Hezekiah? 


06:18.560 --> 06:22.098
If so, how would Hezekiah respond? 


06:22.098 --> 06:24.100
Wasn’t he a good king? 


06:24.100 --> 06:26.635
Wouldn’t he say: 
“Now wait a minute, Prophet. 


06:26.635 --> 06:28.303
You’ve got it all wrong”? 


06:28.303 --> 06:29.905
Would he get offended? 


06:29.905 --> 06:34.110
Would he imprison Micah for sedition? 


06:34.110 --> 06:37.347
We gain a fascinating insight 
from a conversation 


06:37.347 --> 06:39.349
that took place a century or so later 


06:39.348 --> 06:42.985
recorded by Jeremiah in chapter 26. 


06:42.985 --> 06:48.000
Notice what it says in Jeremiah 26:18, 19: 


06:49.392 --> 06:51.727
“Micah of Moresheth was prophesying 


06:51.727 --> 06:54.397
“in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, 


06:54.397 --> 06:56.432
“and he said to all the people of Judah, 


06:56.432 --> 06:58.902
‘This is what Jehovah of armies says,’” 


06:58.902 --> 07:01.037
quoting Micah 3:12; 


07:01.037 --> 07:03.072
verse 19: 


07:03.072 --> 07:08.577
“Did King Hezekiah of Judah 
and all Judah then put him to death? 


07:08.577 --> 07:13.282
“Did he not fear Jehovah 
and beg for Jehovah’s favor, 


07:13.282 --> 07:15.719
“so that Jehovah changed his mind 


07:15.718 --> 07:19.000
concerning the calamity 
that he had spoken against them?”


07:20.623 --> 07:23.691
Hezekiah repented 


07:23.692 --> 07:27.997
at what Micah preached


07:27.997 --> 07:30.900
—fascinating insight. 


07:30.900 --> 07:34.403
Did Micah stir in young Hezekiah 


07:34.403 --> 07:38.573
a desire to be a better student of God’s law? 


07:38.573 --> 07:41.776
Did Hezekiah, as a prince, 


07:41.777 --> 07:46.149
then write the 119th Psalm 


07:46.148 --> 07:49.051
with its famous concluding words: 


07:49.052 --> 07:51.687
“I have strayed like a lost sheep. 


07:51.687 --> 07:53.689
“Search for your servant, 


07:53.688 --> 07:57.160
for I have not forgotten 
your commandments”? 


07:57.160 --> 07:59.462
Although we can’t say for certain, 


07:59.462 --> 08:03.399
it’s all within the realm of possibility. 


08:03.398 --> 08:08.070
And what we do know is that Hezekiah 


08:08.070 --> 08:10.673
took Micah’s counsel to heart 


08:10.673 --> 08:13.843
because Micah was patient; 


08:13.843 --> 08:16.811
Micah stuck with his assignment. 


08:16.812 --> 08:20.349
Even though Micah wrote 
the words of today’s text, 


08:20.348 --> 08:23.151
he refused to give up hope 


08:23.152 --> 08:26.222
in Jehovah’s ability 


08:26.222 --> 08:28.624
to bring about changes 


08:28.623 --> 08:32.961
in people’s hearts and people’s thinking. 


08:32.962 --> 08:35.097
Micah’s patience paid off. 


08:35.097 --> 08:37.099
He waited on Jehovah. 


08:37.098 --> 08:41.503
He saw wonderful results 
right in his own lifetime. 


08:41.503 --> 08:45.641
And you too are acting loyally 


08:45.642 --> 08:49.279
in a very disloyal world. 


08:49.278 --> 08:53.281
What will be the effect 
of your patient endurance 


08:53.282 --> 09:02.375
on others today?

00:01 “Their best one is like a brier,
00:03 “their most upright one
00:05 is worse than a thorn hedge.”
00:08 This is an example
00:10 of many agricultural metaphors
00:13 that Micah used in his writing.
00:15 But who was he talking about?
00:17 Why did he say this,
00:19 and what lesson  can we take away from today’s text?
00:23 To find the historical setting,
00:26 it’s helpful to look  at the “Table of the Books of the Bible”
00:28 that appears on page 1662
00:30 of the printed edition  of our New World Translation.
00:33 But if you’re using the JW Library app,
00:36 this is what you need to do.
00:38 Please follow along.
00:40 First, go to your home page for the Bible.
00:45 In the menu bar at the top,
00:47 you’ll see the word Introduction on the left.
00:51 At the bottom of the list that comes up,
00:53 you’ll see “Names and Order of the Books.”
00:56 Tap that.
00:58 And don’t be put off by the fact
01:00 that you’re only seeing  the names in order of the books.
01:03 Rather, scroll all the way  down to the bottom,
01:06 and there you will see  “Table of the Books of the Bible.”
01:11 Tap that.
01:13 You can bookmark it if you’d like  to get there faster the next time.
01:17 And then scroll down to Micah.
01:19 What do we learn  about the context of our day’s text?
01:23 It was written by Micah; we knew that.
01:25 Where was he?
01:26 In Judah.
01:28 When did he write this prophecy?
01:30 Sometime before the year 717 B.C.E.
01:33 And what time period does his writing cover?
01:36 The 60 years spanning from 777—717 B.C.E.
01:41 counting backwards toward the time of Jesus.
01:43 Now what was happening  during those 60 years?
01:45 We have a chart  in Appendix A6 that helps us.
01:50 Again,  if you’re following along in JW Library,
01:53 go to the upper left-hand corner  of your screen
01:55 and tap the menu bar,  “Names and Order”;
01:58 that is to say,  go back.
02:00 There you’ll see toward the bottom  of the list Appendix A.
02:04 Or you can always go back to the home page
02:06 and select Appendix A from the menu ribbon.
02:09 In any event, when you get to Appendix A,
02:11 you’ll see the option  for “A6 Chart:
02:14 Prophets and Kings  of Judah and of Israel.”
02:18 And remember,  we’re looking for what life was like
02:21 during the 60 years  between 777 and 717 B.C.E.
02:25 So likely, Part 2 would reveal  what we’re looking for.
02:28 Tap Part 2.
02:30 There we find this beautiful chart.
02:32 What does it tell us?
02:34 That Micah was a contemporary  of Isaiah and Hosea
02:38 and that his service as a prophet in Judah
02:40 ran during the reigns of Jotham for 16 years,
02:43 wicked King Ahaz for 16 years,
02:47 but also most of Hezekiah’s 29-year reign.
02:53 Meanwhile, what was happening  up in the northern ten-tribe kingdom?
02:57 Look at the chart again on the right
03:00 starting in 777 B.C.E.
03:03 Nineteen years are left of Pekah’s reign,
03:06 and then nine years of Hoshea’s rule,
03:09 but here things began to destabilize.
03:12 We see the Assyrian monarchy moving in
03:15 exerting its influence in Israel’s affairs.
03:18 And then, in 740 B.C.E.,
03:20 it’s all over  for the northern ten-tribe kingdom.
03:24 Did those events  have an influence on the south?
03:28 Certainly, it fed the Assyrians’ pride,
03:31 fueling their belief that they could come in
03:33 and overtake Judah in the same fashion.
03:35 And what do we know  about Jotham,
03:38 Ahaz, and Hezekiah?
03:41 Well, it was during Jotham’s reign
03:43 that Judah began to experience  military pressure
03:46 from an alliance between King Pekah
03:49 and King Rezin of Syria,
03:52 and that alliance would eventually  weaken Judah’s defenses
03:56 and leave them open to brutal attacks
03:59 by the Edomites in the southeast
04:02 and the Philistines coming from the west.
04:05 However, none of that humbled  wicked King Ahaz.
04:10 He led a debauched life,  he sought refuge with pagan rulers,
04:14 he adopted their way of worship,
04:16 and he even sacrificed his own sons
04:18 in the fire in the Valley of Hinnom.
04:21 No wonder Micah wrote what he did  in the words of today’s text.
04:26 Let’s go back and read it now  from Micah 7:2-4:
04:33 “The loyal one has perished from the earth;
04:37 “among men there is no one upright.
04:41 “All of them lie in ambush for bloodshed.
04:45 “Each hunts his own brother with a dragnet.
04:48 “Their hands are expert at doing what is bad;
04:51 “the prince is making demands,
04:55 “the judge asks for a reward,
04:58 “the prominent one makes known his desires,
05:01 “and they work it out together.
05:03 “Their best one is like thorns,
05:07 “their most upright one
05:09 is worse than a thorn hedge.”
05:13 So, what’s the meaning of the metaphor?
05:16 The topic: the unfaithful Israelites.
05:19 The image:
05:21 a patch of briers and thorns.
05:24 The point of similarity:
05:26 just as getting stuck in briers,  or a thorn hedge,
05:29 injures anyone who walks into it,
05:31 these corrupt Israelites harmed  anyone with whom they had dealings.
05:36 Now, how far did the corruption go?
05:38 Back in verse 2,  it said it was all-pervasive.
05:41 There was no one,  not even one who was upright.
05:44 Verse 3 indicated it reached  the highest levels of society.
05:48 The prominent expressed their wishes,
05:50 the judges accepted bribes  to carry out those wishes,
05:53 and they all were in cahoots.
05:55 They worked it out together.
05:58 Now verse 3 says this included the prince.
06:03 Who would have been the prince
06:06 in the days of King Ahaz?
06:10 Hezekiah?
06:12 Might Micah have written those words
06:15 during the actual reign of Hezekiah?
06:18 If so, how would Hezekiah respond?
06:22 Wasn’t he a good king?
06:24 Wouldn’t he say:  “Now wait a minute, Prophet.
06:26 You’ve got it all wrong”?
06:28 Would he get offended?
06:29 Would he imprison Micah for sedition?
06:34 We gain a fascinating insight  from a conversation
06:37 that took place a century or so later
06:39 recorded by Jeremiah in chapter 26.
06:42 Notice what it says in Jeremiah 26:18, 19:
06:49 “Micah of Moresheth was prophesying
06:51 “in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah,
06:54 “and he said to all the people of Judah,
06:56 ‘This is what Jehovah of armies says,’”
06:58 quoting Micah 3:12;
07:01 verse 19:
07:03 “Did King Hezekiah of Judah  and all Judah then put him to death?
07:08 “Did he not fear Jehovah  and beg for Jehovah’s favor,
07:13 “so that Jehovah changed his mind
07:15 concerning the calamity  that he had spoken against them?”
07:20 Hezekiah repented
07:23 at what Micah preached
07:27 —fascinating insight.
07:30 Did Micah stir in young Hezekiah
07:34 a desire to be a better student of God’s law?
07:38 Did Hezekiah, as a prince,
07:41 then write the 119th Psalm
07:46 with its famous concluding words:
07:49 “I have strayed like a lost sheep.
07:51 “Search for your servant,
07:53 for I have not forgotten  your commandments”?
07:57 Although we can’t say for certain,
07:59 it’s all within the realm of possibility.
08:03 And what we do know is that Hezekiah
08:08 took Micah’s counsel to heart
08:10 because Micah was patient;
08:13 Micah stuck with his assignment.
08:16 Even though Micah wrote  the words of today’s text,
08:20 he refused to give up hope
08:23 in Jehovah’s ability
08:26 to bring about changes
08:28 in people’s hearts and people’s thinking.
08:32 Micah’s patience paid off.
08:35 He waited on Jehovah.
08:37 He saw wonderful results  right in his own lifetime.
08:41 And you too are acting loyally
08:45 in a very disloyal world.
08:49 What will be the effect  of your patient endurance
08:53 on others today?

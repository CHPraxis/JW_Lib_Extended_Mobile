00:01 We’d like for you to picture this scene:
00:03 You’re with thousands
00:05 of your brothers and sisters at a convention.
00:07 You’re riveted with the brother who’s giving,
00:10 delivering, this beautiful talk.
00:12 He’s actually giving some instruction about the great tribulation
00:15 and what we need to do now to go through that great tribulation loyally.
00:22 But then a man steps up to the platform
00:25 and addresses the speaker and says:
00:28 “My brother is the executor of my father’s will,
00:31 “and he’s cutting me out.
00:32 “I deserve more.
00:34 “I’d like for you to step down from the platform,
00:36 come over and talk some sense into my brother.”
00:39 Well, as ridiculous as that sounds,
00:41 this really did happen 2,000 years ago.
00:46 And as was brought up by our commenter, in Luke chapter 12,
00:49 Jesus was speaking to a large crowd.
00:52 In fact, at Luke 12:1,
00:55 it says that there was “a crowd of so many thousands [that] had gathered together
01:00 that they were stepping on one another.”
01:03 So try to imagine the scene.
01:06 All were trying to crowd closer to Jesus.
01:09 They wanted to listen to what he had to say.
01:11 There were some that were sitting; some were standing.
01:14 They were on the ground; they were on rocks;
01:16 they were trying to go under a shade tree.
01:19 Maybe it was sunny.
01:20 Maybe the sun was in their eyes.
01:22 Babies were crying.
01:23 So all kinds of distractions were taking place.
01:26 But yet, Jesus continued focusing on his message.
01:31 Yes, Jesus was speaking to some of those followers
01:35 about important spiritual matters.
01:38 Some of those spiritual matters were designed to prepare them
01:42 for opposition that lay ahead
01:44 and how they could tap into Jehovah’s holy spirit and be successful.
01:48 And just then, we read at Luke 12:13,
01:53 the man has his request.
01:56 He says: “Teacher, tell my brother  to divide the inheritance with me.”
02:01 What was the man thinking?
02:03 It had nothing to do with what Jesus
02:07 was trying to talk about to those who were gathered.
02:10 Really, we can see that he was weighed down with a distraction
02:15 —anxieties over personal issues with his brother.
02:19 Rather than focusing in on what Jesus had prepared for them
02:23 that would really prepare them for the future,
02:25 he was distracted  with these mundane things.
02:29 And likely, he really didn’t hear anything that Jesus had to say.
02:34 Not only was this man distracted
02:36 but he single-handedly distracted thousands of others.
02:41 And no doubt those that were gathered
02:43 had their own anxieties that they were thinking about.
02:48 But did the distractions from this man become Jesus’ distractions?
02:53 No.
02:55 Rather, Jesus refused to be drawn into this dispute
02:59 over some material things.
03:01 His response is found in our Scriptural theme for today, Luke 12:14.
03:06 And you can imagine Jesus looking out at the crowd,
03:09 finding that man and saying:
03:12 “Man, who appointed me judge or arbitrator between you two?”
03:18 Jesus could have ruled on it.  He was perfect.
03:20 He could’ve stepped down away from his area
03:24 that he was speaking from and addressed the man.
03:26 But he did not.
03:28 It was not the time; it was not the place.
03:31 And it really wasn’t Jesus’ place to get involved.
03:35 Jesus did not allow this man to break his focus—his spiritual focus—
03:40 and his real purpose  for coming to the earth.
03:42 And what is that?
03:44 John 3:17 says:
03:46 “For God did not send his Son into the world for him to judge the world,
03:51 but for the world to be saved through him.”
03:54 So Jesus knew that it was the time and the place
03:57 to give instructions to his followers,
03:59 prepare them for the future,
04:01 point them towards Jehovah and the Kingdom.
04:05 Knowing that we are imperfect and easily distracted,
04:09 Jesus reminds us in verse 15
04:13 of chapter 12 what is needed.
04:16 He said to them, not just to the man,  but to all those gathered:
04:19 “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed,
04:24 [or the footnote says, “covetousness”]
04:27 because even when a [man] has an abundance,
04:30 his life does not result from the things he possesses.”
04:34 So, what was Jesus trying to get across?
04:37 Yes, they had anxieties, they had distractions,
04:40 but they needed to keep focused.
04:43 Their eyes needed to be looking  at what lay ahead
04:46 and how they could serve  Jehovah acceptably.
04:48 But he also warned against
04:51 allowing anxieties to turn into distractions.
04:55 Note verse 29 of chapter 12.
04:58 He said: “Stop seeking [or focusing on]
05:02 “what you will eat and what you will drink,
05:04 and stop being in anxious suspense.”
05:07 And verse 30 goes on to say  that’s what happens in the world.
05:11 That’s what people are pursuing today.
05:13 But he said: “Stop.  Stop focusing; stop seeking.”
05:18 And we think about the word “anxious.”
05:20 Jesus used this quite a bit within this chapter
05:23 and in other discussions he had with his listeners.
05:26 What does the word “anxious” mean?
05:29 The Greek verb rendered “to be anxious” means “to have the mind distracted.”
05:35 The word “distract,” where does that come from?
05:38 It’s interesting to note that “distract”
05:40 comes from the Latin word tractus
05:42 meaning “to be pulled or dragged,”
05:46 and this gives us the root word “tract.”
05:49 So to “attract” would be drawing toward something.
05:54 And to “distract” means to pull someone’s attention away from something.
05:59 So this is what’s happening every day of our lives.
06:02 We could be attracted to something or distracted from something.
06:07 And, really, distractions come in all shapes and sizes.
06:11 In fact, my little illustration here will help us to appreciate
06:14 that they come in various colors, various shades, and sizes.
06:19 Now, what happens with distractions?
06:21 We know that they come in from external means
06:24 and sometimes from ourselves.
06:26 We cause some of our anxieties, some of our distractions.
06:30 But if we do not keep our focus,
06:32 what eventually happens to distractions?
06:36 They become our main focus.
06:38 We’re not able to see past them.
06:42 We need to continually keep our eyes open
06:46 so that we can continue to serve Jehovah.
06:49 Well, distractions for all of us come in various shapes and sizes.
06:54 It could be the health concerns of our mate,
06:57 ourselves, our aging parents.
07:00 It could be the loss of a loved one or how we can provide for our family.
07:04 It could be the responsibilities that we have
07:07 —the assignments— that could be weighing us down.
07:11 Or it could be our goal  to have more responsibilities.
07:14 We see other brothers that are gaining responsibilities,
07:17 and we would wish to have those.
07:18 Well, all of these could become the center of our life
07:22 and distract us from our service.
07:25 But we want to remember that when anxieties
07:28 and distractions threaten us,  there’s something that we can do about it.
07:32 A quote that I found that I thought was appropriate said,
07:36 “Starve your distractions; feed your focus.”
07:40 Well, how do we starve our distractions and feed our focus?
07:44 We go to something  that Jesus said 2,000 years ago
07:48 that has been the key to faithful servants ever since,
07:51 and that is in chapter 12 in verse 31 of Luke.
07:55 He says: ‘Keep seeking [or focusing on] the Kingdom,
07:58 and all these other things will be added to you.’
08:01 And then in verse 34: ‘For where your treasure is,
08:04 that is where your heart will be also.’
08:07 So as we seek the Kingdom
08:10 and we treasure what Jehovah has within that Kingdom,
08:14 we know that’s where our heart will be and we can lessen our anxieties.
08:18 We think about faithful servants in the past before Jesus, like David.
08:22 They had anxieties like you and me.
08:25 He was a king.
08:26 He had many opportunities
08:28 to be surrounded with spiritual people,
08:31 but even he faced times that he needed help.
08:35 He treasured drawing close to Jehovah with prayer.
08:38 In fact, one of my go-to scriptures, and it may be one of yours,
08:41 is what he said at Psalm 94:19,
08:45 that’s Psalm 94:19:
08:49 “When anxieties [or the footnote says, “disquieting thoughts”] overwhelmed me,
08:53 you comforted [me] and soothed me.”
08:58 That really helps us when we’re going through anxieties and distractions.
09:02 Along with asking Jehovah for help,
09:04 calmness of heart, and calmness of mind,
09:07 we do our best to apply what Paul said at Hebrews 2:1:
09:11 “To pay more than the usual attention  to the things we have heard,
09:16 so that we never drift away.”
09:19 That’s what happened to the man that raised the objection to Jesus.
09:23 His mind wandered,  he drifted away,
09:25 and he allowed others  to be distracted as well.
09:28 We want to copy Jesus Christ
09:30 who always had that spiritual focus well in mind.
09:33 And we want to have our service to Jehovah,
09:36 to the best of our ability,
09:38 to be focused without allowing any distractions
09:41 to take us out of the race for life.

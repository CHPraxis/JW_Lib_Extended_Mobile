00:01.183 --> 00:03.753
We’d like for you to picture this scene:


00:03.753 --> 00:05.321
You’re with thousands 


00:05.322 --> 00:07.624
of your brothers and sisters at a convention. 


00:07.623 --> 00:10.626
You’re riveted with the brother who’s giving, 


00:10.627 --> 00:12.629
delivering, this beautiful talk. 


00:12.628 --> 00:15.998
He’s actually giving some instruction
about the great tribulation


00:15.998 --> 00:21.000
and what we need to do now
to go through that great tribulation loyally. 


00:22.005 --> 00:25.642
But then a man steps up to the platform 


00:25.642 --> 00:28.277
and addresses the speaker and says: 


00:28.277 --> 00:31.280
“My brother is the executor
of my father’s will,


00:31.280 --> 00:32.782
“and he’s cutting me out. 


00:32.782 --> 00:34.184
“I deserve more. 


00:34.183 --> 00:36.251
“I’d like for you to step down
from the platform, 


00:36.252 --> 00:39.222
come over and talk some sense
into my brother.” 


00:39.222 --> 00:41.892
Well, as ridiculous as that sounds,


00:41.892 --> 00:46.195
this really did happen 2,000 years ago.


00:46.195 --> 00:49.498
And as was brought up by our commenter,
in Luke chapter 12,


00:49.498 --> 00:52.468
Jesus was speaking to a large crowd. 


00:52.468 --> 00:55.805
In fact, at Luke 12:1,


00:55.805 --> 01:00.277
it says that there was “a crowd of so many
thousands [that] had gathered together


01:00.277 --> 01:03.780
that they were stepping on one another.” 


01:03.780 --> 01:06.115
So try to imagine the scene. 


01:06.115 --> 01:09.885
All were trying to crowd closer to Jesus. 


01:09.885 --> 01:11.888
They wanted to listen to what he had to say. 


01:11.888 --> 01:14.456
There were some that were sitting;
some were standing. 


01:14.457 --> 01:16.292
They were on the ground;
they were on rocks;


01:16.292 --> 01:19.395
they were trying to go under a shade tree. 


01:19.395 --> 01:20.930
Maybe it was sunny. 


01:20.930 --> 01:22.332
Maybe the sun was in their eyes. 


01:22.332 --> 01:23.734
Babies were crying. 


01:23.733 --> 01:26.735
So all kinds of distractions
were taking place. 


01:26.735 --> 01:31.207
But yet, Jesus continued
focusing on his message. 


01:31.207 --> 01:35.745
Yes, Jesus was speaking
to some of those followers


01:35.745 --> 01:38.313
about important spiritual matters.


01:38.313 --> 01:42.585
Some of those spiritual matters
were designed to prepare them


01:42.585 --> 01:44.420
for opposition that lay ahead


01:44.420 --> 01:48.625
and how they could tap
into Jehovah’s holy spirit and be successful. 


01:48.625 --> 01:53.630
And just then,
we read at Luke 12:13, 


01:53.630 --> 01:56.032
the man has his request. 


01:56.032 --> 02:01.872
He says: “Teacher, tell my brother 
to divide the inheritance with me.” 


02:01.872 --> 02:03.907
What was the man thinking? 


02:03.907 --> 02:07.177
It had nothing to do with what Jesus


02:07.177 --> 02:10.947
was trying to talk about to those
who were gathered. 


02:10.947 --> 02:15.885
Really, we can see that he was
weighed down with a distraction


02:15.885 --> 02:19.588
—anxieties over personal issues
with his brother. 


02:19.588 --> 02:23.526
Rather than focusing in on what Jesus
had prepared for them


02:23.527 --> 02:25.929
that would really prepare them
for the future, 


02:25.928 --> 02:29.565
he was distracted 
with these mundane things. 


02:29.565 --> 02:34.237
And likely, he really didn’t hear
anything that Jesus had to say. 


02:34.237 --> 02:36.772
Not only was this man distracted


02:36.772 --> 02:41.845
but he single-handedly
distracted thousands of others. 


02:41.845 --> 02:43.880
And no doubt those that were gathered


02:43.880 --> 02:47.000
had their own anxieties
that they were thinking about.


02:48.483 --> 02:53.488
But did the distractions from this man
become Jesus’ distractions? 


02:53.488 --> 02:55.558
No. 


02:55.558 --> 02:59.061
Rather, Jesus refused to be
drawn into this dispute


02:59.062 --> 03:01.197
over some material things. 


03:01.197 --> 03:06.202
His response is found in our Scriptural theme
for today, Luke 12:14. 


03:06.202 --> 03:09.205
And you can imagine Jesus
looking out at the crowd, 


03:09.205 --> 03:12.708
finding that man and saying:


03:12.708 --> 03:17.000
“Man, who appointed me judge
or arbitrator between you two?” 


03:18.447 --> 03:20.850
Jesus could have ruled on it. 
He was perfect. 


03:20.850 --> 03:24.620
He could’ve stepped down
away from his area


03:24.620 --> 03:26.957
that he was speaking from
and addressed the man. 


03:26.957 --> 03:28.959
But he did not. 


03:28.958 --> 03:31.826
It was not the time;
it was not the place. 


03:31.827 --> 03:35.265
And it really wasn’t Jesus’ place
to get involved. 


03:35.265 --> 03:40.002
Jesus did not allow this man
to break his focus—his spiritual focus—


03:40.002 --> 03:42.539
and his real purpose 
for coming to the earth. 


03:42.538 --> 03:44.373
And what is that? 


03:44.373 --> 03:46.976
John 3:17 says:


03:46.977 --> 03:51.514
“For God did not send his Son into the world
for him to judge the world, 


03:51.513 --> 03:54.850
but for the world
to be saved through him.”


03:54.850 --> 03:57.987
So Jesus knew that it was
the time and the place


03:57.987 --> 03:59.989
to give instructions to his followers, 


03:59.988 --> 04:01.991
prepare them for the future,


04:01.992 --> 04:04.000
point them towards
Jehovah and the Kingdom. 


04:05.728 --> 04:09.931
Knowing that we are imperfect
and easily distracted, 


04:09.932 --> 04:13.102
Jesus reminds us in verse 15 


04:13.102 --> 04:16.172
of chapter 12 what is needed. 


04:16.172 --> 04:19.942
He said to them, not just to the man, 
but to all those gathered: 


04:19.942 --> 04:24.447
“Keep your eyes open
and guard against every sort of greed,


04:24.447 --> 04:27.117
[or the footnote says, “covetousness”]


04:27.117 --> 04:30.185
because even when a [man]
has an abundance, 


04:30.185 --> 04:34.057
his life does not result
from the things he possesses.”


04:34.057 --> 04:37.260
So, what was Jesus trying to get across? 


04:37.260 --> 04:40.763
Yes, they had anxieties,
they had distractions,


04:40.763 --> 04:43.098
but they needed to keep focused. 


04:43.098 --> 04:46.168
Their eyes needed to be looking 
at what lay ahead 


04:46.168 --> 04:48.738
and how they could serve 
Jehovah acceptably. 


04:48.738 --> 04:51.473
But he also warned against


04:51.473 --> 04:55.176
allowing anxieties
to turn into distractions. 


04:55.177 --> 04:58.682
Note verse 29 of chapter 12. 


04:58.682 --> 05:02.085
He said:
“Stop seeking [or focusing on]


05:02.085 --> 05:04.387
“what you will eat
and what you will drink, 


05:04.387 --> 05:07.757
and stop being in anxious suspense.” 


05:07.757 --> 05:11.260
And verse 30 goes on to say 
that’s what happens in the world. 


05:11.260 --> 05:13.195
That’s what people are pursuing today. 


05:13.195 --> 05:17.000
But he said: “Stop. 
Stop focusing; stop seeking.”


05:18.033 --> 05:20.370
And we think about the word “anxious.” 


05:20.370 --> 05:23.038
Jesus used this quite a bit
within this chapter 


05:23.038 --> 05:26.175
and in other discussions
he had with his listeners. 


05:26.175 --> 05:29.312
What does the word “anxious” mean? 


05:29.312 --> 05:35.385
The Greek verb rendered “to be anxious”
means “to have the mind distracted.” 


05:35.385 --> 05:38.253
The word “distract,”
where does that come from? 


05:38.253 --> 05:40.321
It’s interesting to note that “distract”


05:40.322 --> 05:42.992
comes from the Latin word tractus


05:42.992 --> 05:46.195
meaning “to be pulled or dragged,” 


05:46.195 --> 05:49.465
and this gives us the root word “tract.” 


05:49.465 --> 05:54.270
So to “attract” would be
drawing toward something. 


05:54.270 --> 05:59.208
And to “distract” means to pull someone’s
attention away from something. 


05:59.208 --> 06:02.411
So this is what’s happening
every day of our lives. 


06:02.412 --> 06:07.284
We could be attracted to something
or distracted from something.


06:07.283 --> 06:11.553
And, really, distractions
come in all shapes and sizes. 


06:11.553 --> 06:14.990
In fact, my little illustration here
will help us to appreciate


06:14.990 --> 06:19.528
that they come in various colors,
various shades, and sizes. 


06:19.528 --> 06:21.930
Now, what happens with distractions? 


06:21.930 --> 06:24.533
We know that they
come in from external means


06:24.533 --> 06:26.601
and sometimes from ourselves. 


06:26.602 --> 06:30.139
We cause some of our anxieties,
some of our distractions. 


06:30.138 --> 06:32.975
But if we do not keep our focus, 


06:32.975 --> 06:36.112
what eventually happens to distractions? 


06:36.112 --> 06:38.647
They become our main focus. 


06:38.647 --> 06:41.000
We’re not able to see past them. 


06:42.785 --> 06:46.255
We need to continually keep
our eyes open 


06:46.255 --> 06:49.558
so that we can continue
to serve Jehovah.


06:49.558 --> 06:54.563
Well, distractions for all of us
come in various shapes and sizes. 


06:54.563 --> 06:57.966
It could be
the health concerns of our mate, 


06:57.967 --> 07:00.504
ourselves, our aging parents. 


07:00.503 --> 07:04.673
It could be the loss of a loved one
or how we can provide for our family. 


07:04.673 --> 07:07.676
It could be
the responsibilities that we have


07:07.677 --> 07:11.080
—the assignments—
that could be weighing us down. 


07:11.080 --> 07:14.317
Or it could be our goal 
to have more responsibilities. 


07:14.317 --> 07:17.019
We see other brothers
that are gaining responsibilities,


07:17.018 --> 07:18.921
and we would wish to have those. 


07:18.922 --> 07:22.225
Well, all of these could become
the center of our life


07:22.225 --> 07:25.160
and distract us from our service.


07:25.160 --> 07:28.965
But we want to remember
that when anxieties 


07:28.965 --> 07:32.468
and distractions threaten us, 
there’s something that we can do about it. 


07:32.468 --> 07:36.405
A quote that I found
that I thought was appropriate said,


07:36.405 --> 07:40.643
“Starve your distractions;
feed your focus.” 


07:40.643 --> 07:44.346
Well, how do we starve our distractions
and feed our focus? 


07:44.347 --> 07:48.017
We go to something 
that Jesus said 2,000 years ago


07:48.017 --> 07:51.554
that has been the key
to faithful servants ever since, 


07:51.553 --> 07:55.056
and that is in chapter 12
in verse 31 of Luke. 


07:55.057 --> 07:58.760
He says: ‘Keep seeking
[or focusing on] the Kingdom,


07:58.760 --> 08:01.263
and all these other things
will be added to you.’ 


08:01.263 --> 08:04.966
And then in verse 34:
‘For where your treasure is,


08:04.967 --> 08:07.837
that is where your heart will be also.’ 


08:07.837 --> 08:10.707
So as we seek the Kingdom 


08:10.707 --> 08:14.244
and we treasure what Jehovah
has within that Kingdom,


08:14.243 --> 08:18.346
we know that’s where our heart
will be and we can lessen our anxieties.


08:18.347 --> 08:22.885
We think about faithful servants
in the past before Jesus, like David. 


08:22.885 --> 08:25.087
They had anxieties like you and me. 


08:25.087 --> 08:26.255
He was a king. 


08:26.255 --> 08:28.590
He had many opportunities


08:28.590 --> 08:31.527
to be surrounded with spiritual people, 


08:31.527 --> 08:35.364
but even he faced times
that he needed help. 


08:35.363 --> 08:38.566
He treasured drawing close
to Jehovah with prayer. 


08:38.567 --> 08:41.804
In fact, one of my go-to scriptures,
and it may be one of yours,


08:41.803 --> 08:45.941
is what he said at Psalm 94:19, 


08:45.942 --> 08:49.345
that’s Psalm 94:19:


08:49.345 --> 08:53.748
“When anxieties [or the footnote says,
“disquieting thoughts”] overwhelmed me, 


08:53.748 --> 08:57.000
you comforted [me] and soothed me.” 


08:58.053 --> 09:02.591
That really helps us when we’re
going through anxieties and distractions.


09:02.592 --> 09:04.927
Along with asking Jehovah for help,


09:04.927 --> 09:07.530
calmness of heart,
and calmness of mind, 


09:07.530 --> 09:11.867
we do our best to apply
what Paul said at Hebrews 2:1: 


09:11.867 --> 09:16.039
“To pay more than the usual attention 
to the things we have heard,


09:16.038 --> 09:19.341
so that we never drift away.” 


09:19.342 --> 09:23.145
That’s what happened to the man
that raised the objection to Jesus. 


09:23.145 --> 09:25.615
His mind wandered, 
he drifted away, 


09:25.615 --> 09:28.550
and he allowed others 
to be distracted as well. 


09:28.550 --> 09:30.887
We want to copy Jesus Christ


09:30.887 --> 09:33.957
who always had
that spiritual focus well in mind. 


09:33.957 --> 09:36.992
And we want to have
our service to Jehovah, 


09:36.992 --> 09:38.995
to the best of our ability,


09:38.995 --> 09:41.997
to be focused without
allowing any distractions


09:41.997 --> 09:49.990
to take us out of the race for life.

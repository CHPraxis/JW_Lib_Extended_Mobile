00:01.083 --> 00:03.085
Our text today is highlighting the fact 


00:03.085 --> 00:04.487
that we do not want 


00:04.487 --> 00:07.257
to be trapped by the Devil. 


00:07.257 --> 00:08.992
And that’s what the apostle Paul


00:08.992 --> 00:11.327
was concerned about with the Christians


00:11.327 --> 00:12.495
in Colossae.


00:12.495 --> 00:14.497
If we go to Colossians 


00:14.497 --> 00:16.800
where our text is found, 


00:16.800 --> 00:19.802
notice his words 
and his recommendations to them 


00:19.802 --> 00:24.000
in chapter 2 and verses 6 and 7. 


00:25.742 --> 00:28.412
He says: 
“Therefore, just as you have accepted 


00:28.412 --> 00:30.414
“Christ Jesus the Lord, 


00:30.413 --> 00:32.981
“go on walking in union with him, 


00:32.982 --> 00:35.552
“being rooted and built up in him 


00:35.552 --> 00:38.054
“and being stabilized in the faith, 


00:38.053 --> 00:40.056
“just as you were taught, 


00:40.057 --> 00:43.059
and overflowing with thanksgiving.” 


00:43.058 --> 00:47.230
So Paul was encouraging them: 
‘Be strong Christians. 


00:47.230 --> 00:49.665
‘Have this deep, 


00:49.665 --> 00:52.935
‘spiritual taproot, 
so to speak. 


00:52.935 --> 00:56.272
Have your faith solid 
in Christ Jesus.’ 


00:56.272 --> 00:58.274
I was in Louisiana last week, 


00:58.273 --> 01:02.045
and I tried to pull up a pecan seedling
—a little plant of a pecan. 


01:02.045 --> 01:03.947
Have you ever tried that? 


01:03.947 --> 01:08.652
You cannot pull it up with your hands 
because the taproot goes so deep; 


01:08.652 --> 01:11.420
you have to have a shovel. 


01:11.420 --> 01:13.823
And so that’s what Paul was saying


01:13.823 --> 01:17.293
—be sure that your spiritual strength 


01:17.293 --> 01:19.895
is solid and that it goes deep.


01:19.895 --> 01:22.098
Well, why did he say that? 


01:22.098 --> 01:24.700
If you notice in verse 4, he says: 


01:24.700 --> 01:26.702
“I am saying this so that no one 


01:26.702 --> 01:31.340
may delude you 
with persuasive arguments.” 


01:31.340 --> 01:33.443
See, he was concerned 


01:33.443 --> 01:37.913
that even those 
with a strong spiritual foundation 


01:37.913 --> 01:42.098
may be deceived 
by persuasive arguments 


01:42.098 --> 01:46.321
and, as a result, 
destabilize their faith, so to speak. 


01:46.322 --> 01:50.025
So, what were some 
of the persuasive arguments? 


01:50.025 --> 01:53.863
Well, our text for today 
talks about them in verse 8. 


01:53.863 --> 01:57.333
He says: 
“Look out that no one takes you captive 


01:57.333 --> 02:00.336
“by means of the philosophy 
and empty deception 


02:00.337 --> 02:02.439
“according to human tradition, 


02:02.438 --> 02:05.341
“according to the elementary things 
of the world 


02:05.342 --> 02:08.077
and not according to Christ.” 


02:08.077 --> 02:12.715
So, what were the philosophies 
and empty deception? 


02:12.715 --> 02:17.487
Well, in Paul’s time, 
it included the Greek philosophies of Plato, 


02:17.487 --> 02:19.489
and that could affect 


02:19.488 --> 02:23.626
the spirituality of individuals 
in the congregation. 


02:23.627 --> 02:27.397
Also, that term 
“philosophy” was expanded; 


02:27.397 --> 02:31.067
it referred to more 
than just the Greek philosophers; 


02:31.067 --> 02:33.904
it also had reference 
to many, many groups, 


02:33.903 --> 02:36.805
many schools of thought


02:36.805 --> 02:39.575
—even religious thoughts. 


02:39.575 --> 02:42.915
And Paul didn’t want them to become


02:42.915 --> 02:45.548
—their faith to become destabilized


02:45.548 --> 02:50.151
because of following 
those improper thoughts. 


02:50.152 --> 02:52.155
And notice, 
he said in verse 8, 


02:52.155 --> 02:54.523
so that you’re not made captive. 


02:54.523 --> 02:58.861
He didn’t want them 
to be captive to such thinking.


02:58.862 --> 03:03.800
But is there something else 
besides the philosophies? 


03:03.800 --> 03:06.168
Well, verse 8 says also 


03:06.168 --> 03:08.403
“elementary things of the world.” 


03:08.403 --> 03:10.273
Now what is that? 


03:10.273 --> 03:12.675
In answering that question, 
The Watchtower 


03:12.675 --> 03:15.778
of August 15, 2008, 
page 28, 


03:15.778 --> 03:20.550
referred to 1 John 2:15, 16. 


03:20.550 --> 03:22.652
So let’s go there. 


03:22.652 --> 03:27.224
What’s included 
in “the elementary things of the world”? 


03:27.223 --> 03:31.860
First John 2:15, 16, 
it says: 


03:31.860 --> 03:35.465
“Do not love either the world 
or the things in the world. 


03:35.465 --> 03:38.602
“If anyone loves the world, 
the love of the Father is not in him; 


03:38.602 --> 03:40.704
“because everything in the world


03:40.703 --> 03:44.940
“—the desire of the flesh 
and the desire of the eyes 


03:44.940 --> 03:47.577
“and the showy display 
of one’s means of life—


03:47.577 --> 03:51.480
does not originate with the Father, 
but originates with the world.” 


03:51.480 --> 03:55.385
So The Watchtower introduces this 
as not just religious thinking 


03:55.385 --> 03:57.520
that could destabilize your faith; 


03:57.520 --> 04:01.023
it could be desires of the flesh. 


04:01.023 --> 04:03.660
The immoral thinking of the world 


04:03.660 --> 04:07.697
could affect us spiritually.


04:07.697 --> 04:11.134
Over the years, 
over the thousands of years, 


04:11.133 --> 04:15.771
Satan really has carefully crafted
the environment around us


04:15.772 --> 04:17.774
as a trap, 


04:17.773 --> 04:20.943
and so he uses that effectively. 


04:20.943 --> 04:24.113
In fact, he maneuvers circumstances 
around each one of us 


04:24.113 --> 04:26.381
in order to try to work 


04:26.382 --> 04:30.387
on our personal inclinations. 


04:30.387 --> 04:33.389
So that’s why the second sentence 


04:33.388 --> 04:37.893
of our Watchtower summary says this: 


04:37.893 --> 04:40.563
“We can avert disaster 


04:40.563 --> 04:43.565
“if we quickly identify tendencies 


04:43.565 --> 04:46.102
that could lead us into temptation.” 


04:46.102 --> 04:50.272
Disaster
—well, what’s that referring to? 


04:50.272 --> 04:53.542
Well, remember, 
Paul said in the scripture up there, 


04:53.542 --> 04:57.147
Colossians 2:8, 
don’t be captive. 


04:57.147 --> 04:59.815
Captive. 
That’s what Satan wants to do. 


04:59.815 --> 05:01.850
He wants to capture us. 


05:01.850 --> 05:05.220
We’ve heard of the poster 
“Wanted Dead or Alive.” 


05:05.220 --> 05:08.590
He doesn’t want us dead; 
he wants us alive. 


05:08.590 --> 05:10.593
Because why? 


05:10.593 --> 05:13.328
Well, 
it’s an interesting verse in 2 Timothy; 


05:13.328 --> 05:17.400
it tells us why the Devil 
would prefer to have us alive. 


05:17.400 --> 05:23.000
Second Timothy 2:26: 


05:26.075 --> 05:29.845
“And they may come to their senses 
and escape from the snare of the Devil, 


05:29.845 --> 05:34.717
seeing that they have been caught alive
by him to do his will.”


05:34.717 --> 05:37.320
If you’re dead, 
you can’t do Satan’s will. 


05:37.320 --> 05:40.890
So he wants to trap us alive


05:40.890 --> 05:42.992
—or make us captive—


05:42.992 --> 05:44.994
alive to do his will.


05:44.993 --> 05:49.698
So, what do we need to do to keep 
from being trapped by Satan? is the question. 


05:49.698 --> 05:52.835
Well, we read that one sentence 
in our comments 


05:52.835 --> 05:56.238
to quickly identify tendencies. 


05:56.238 --> 05:59.741
OK. 
Now, where do the tendencies start? 


05:59.742 --> 06:03.079
This is an August 1, 1996, Watchtower, 


06:03.078 --> 06:05.346
page 12, paragraph 12, 


06:05.347 --> 06:07.517
and here’s what it says: 


06:07.517 --> 06:12.422
“Unholy actions are not just spontaneous 


06:12.422 --> 06:14.790
“or without prior basis. 


06:14.790 --> 06:17.760
“They are the result of defiling thoughts 


06:17.760 --> 06:21.763
that have been lurking in the heart.” 


06:21.763 --> 06:24.666
That’s what happened to Judas Iscariot. 


06:24.667 --> 06:27.035
Here was an individual that had 


06:27.035 --> 06:30.507
a very deep spiritual taproot, 
so to speak. 


06:30.507 --> 06:32.942
And apparently, 
Jesus didn’t know 


06:32.942 --> 06:35.277
that Judas would be 
the one betraying Him 


06:35.277 --> 06:37.847
when he was appointed 
as an apostle. 


06:37.847 --> 06:42.419
Sometime in 32 C.E., 
Jesus told his apostles: 


06:42.418 --> 06:45.120
“One of you is a slanderer.” 


06:45.120 --> 06:49.458
Apparently, by that time, 
he had identified Judas as that one. 


06:49.458 --> 06:51.726
Possibly by his actions, 


06:51.727 --> 06:55.130
a perfect man, Jesus, 
could identify it early. 


06:55.130 --> 06:57.233
And the Scriptures say 


06:57.233 --> 07:02.271
as a result of Judas 
acting on his thoughts, 


07:02.272 --> 07:05.642
Satan entered into Judas. 


07:05.642 --> 07:08.477
In other words, 
now he was going 


07:08.477 --> 07:11.514
to do the will of Satan. 


07:11.513 --> 07:14.483
But before that all happened, 


07:14.483 --> 07:18.020
there had to have been some wrong thinking 


07:18.020 --> 07:20.990
lurking in the heart of Judas. 


07:20.990 --> 07:22.492
What could it have been? 


07:22.492 --> 07:25.260
Well, it could have involved malice, 


07:25.260 --> 07:28.297
maybe greed, pride, 


07:28.297 --> 07:30.967
hypocrisy, scheming. 


07:30.967 --> 07:34.137
Somewhere in there was 
something that wasn’t right; 


07:34.137 --> 07:36.172
it was going to offend Jehovah God. 


07:36.172 --> 07:39.009
And he didn’t rip it out; 
he didn’t take care of it, 


07:39.008 --> 07:42.711
and look what happened to Judas.


07:42.712 --> 07:44.780
So, what about us? 


07:44.780 --> 07:47.817
What’s lurking in our heart? 


07:47.817 --> 07:52.822
Now we all may be individuals 
with this deep spiritual taproot. 


07:52.822 --> 07:56.325
We’ve been in the truth many years; 
we’ve been at Bethel many years. 


07:56.325 --> 07:59.228
Or we may be young people, 


07:59.228 --> 08:01.596
and we’re serving Jehovah well right now, 


08:01.597 --> 08:05.134
but all of us 
have these improper thoughts 


08:05.133 --> 08:07.135
that we have to deal with. 


08:07.135 --> 08:09.905
Perhaps it could be something like this: 


08:09.905 --> 08:14.710
Maybe there is some scheming
going on in our heart and mind,


08:14.710 --> 08:18.547
maybe scheming of where we’re going 
to get the next drink of alcohol. 


08:18.547 --> 08:23.219
Maybe it’s an evil thought against someone 
that’s lurking in our heart. 


08:23.218 --> 08:27.823
Maybe it is a plan of action 
of how we can see pornography 


08:27.823 --> 08:30.526
or perhaps an unhealthy attraction 


08:30.527 --> 08:34.197
to someone of the opposite sex. 


08:34.197 --> 08:37.634
If that’s the case, 
what can we do? 


08:37.633 --> 08:40.035
Remember Isaiah 30:21. 


08:40.035 --> 08:44.840
It says to hear Jehovah’s voice 
“behind you saying, ‘This is the way.’” 


08:44.840 --> 08:49.812
Don’t give in to Satan’s way, 
but listen to Jehovah God. 


08:49.812 --> 08:53.115
Jehovah God has given us so many things 


08:53.115 --> 08:55.585
that can help us to address 


08:55.585 --> 08:59.888
the wrong thinking 
that’s lurking in our hearts. 


08:59.888 --> 09:04.160
In fact, he gives us guidance 
in his Word, the Bible. 


09:04.160 --> 09:07.630
Just think of all the scriptures 
that we can use, 


09:07.630 --> 09:09.965
no matter what tendency we may have, 


09:09.965 --> 09:12.602
that can address those tendencies. 


09:12.602 --> 09:14.704
He gives us the holy spirit. 


09:14.703 --> 09:18.040
Jesus conveys the voice of Jehovah God. 


09:18.040 --> 09:20.610
He does so by means of the congregation 


09:20.610 --> 09:24.813
through the direction 
of “the faithful and discreet slave.” 


09:24.813 --> 09:28.016
So if we are unable 


09:28.017 --> 09:31.820
to remove an improper tendency, 


09:31.820 --> 09:33.822
then get help 


09:33.822 --> 09:46.219
before Satan captures us to do his will.

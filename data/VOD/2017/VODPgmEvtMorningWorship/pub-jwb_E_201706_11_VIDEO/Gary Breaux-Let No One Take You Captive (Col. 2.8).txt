00:01 Our text today is highlighting the fact
00:03 that we do not want
00:04 to be trapped by the Devil.
00:07 And that’s what the apostle Paul
00:08 was concerned about with the Christians
00:11 in Colossae.
00:12 If we go to Colossians
00:14 where our text is found,
00:16 notice his words  and his recommendations to them
00:19 in chapter 2 and verses 6 and 7.
00:25 He says:  “Therefore, just as you have accepted
00:28 “Christ Jesus the Lord,
00:30 “go on walking in union with him,
00:32 “being rooted and built up in him
00:35 “and being stabilized in the faith,
00:38 “just as you were taught,
00:40 and overflowing with thanksgiving.”
00:43 So Paul was encouraging them:  ‘Be strong Christians.
00:47 ‘Have this deep,
00:49 ‘spiritual taproot,  so to speak.
00:52 Have your faith solid  in Christ Jesus.’
00:56 I was in Louisiana last week,
00:58 and I tried to pull up a pecan seedling —a little plant of a pecan.
01:02 Have you ever tried that?
01:03 You cannot pull it up with your hands  because the taproot goes so deep;
01:08 you have to have a shovel.
01:11 And so that’s what Paul was saying
01:13 —be sure that your spiritual strength
01:17 is solid and that it goes deep.
01:19 Well, why did he say that?
01:22 If you notice in verse 4, he says:
01:24 “I am saying this so that no one
01:26 may delude you  with persuasive arguments.”
01:31 See, he was concerned
01:33 that even those  with a strong spiritual foundation
01:37 may be deceived  by persuasive arguments
01:42 and, as a result,  destabilize their faith, so to speak.
01:46 So, what were some  of the persuasive arguments?
01:50 Well, our text for today  talks about them in verse 8.
01:53 He says:  “Look out that no one takes you captive
01:57 “by means of the philosophy  and empty deception
02:00 “according to human tradition,
02:02 “according to the elementary things  of the world
02:05 and not according to Christ.”
02:08 So, what were the philosophies  and empty deception?
02:12 Well, in Paul’s time,  it included the Greek philosophies of Plato,
02:17 and that could affect
02:19 the spirituality of individuals  in the congregation.
02:23 Also, that term  “philosophy” was expanded;
02:27 it referred to more  than just the Greek philosophers;
02:31 it also had reference  to many, many groups,
02:33 many schools of thought
02:36 —even religious thoughts.
02:39 And Paul didn’t want them to become
02:42 —their faith to become destabilized
02:45 because of following  those improper thoughts.
02:50 And notice,  he said in verse 8,
02:52 so that you’re not made captive.
02:54 He didn’t want them  to be captive to such thinking.
02:58 But is there something else  besides the philosophies?
03:03 Well, verse 8 says also
03:06 “elementary things of the world.”
03:08 Now what is that?
03:10 In answering that question,  The Watchtower
03:12 of August 15, 2008,  page 28,
03:15 referred to 1 John 2:15, 16.
03:20 So let’s go there.
03:22 What’s included  in “the elementary things of the world”?
03:27 First John 2:15, 16,  it says:
03:31 “Do not love either the world  or the things in the world.
03:35 “If anyone loves the world,  the love of the Father is not in him;
03:38 “because everything in the world
03:40 “—the desire of the flesh  and the desire of the eyes
03:44 “and the showy display  of one’s means of life—
03:47 does not originate with the Father,  but originates with the world.”
03:51 So The Watchtower introduces this  as not just religious thinking
03:55 that could destabilize your faith;
03:57 it could be desires of the flesh.
04:01 The immoral thinking of the world
04:03 could affect us spiritually.
04:07 Over the years,  over the thousands of years,
04:11 Satan really has carefully crafted the environment around us
04:15 as a trap,
04:17 and so he uses that effectively.
04:20 In fact, he maneuvers circumstances  around each one of us
04:24 in order to try to work
04:26 on our personal inclinations.
04:30 So that’s why the second sentence
04:33 of our Watchtower summary says this:
04:37 “We can avert disaster
04:40 “if we quickly identify tendencies
04:43 that could lead us into temptation.”
04:46 Disaster —well, what’s that referring to?
04:50 Well, remember,  Paul said in the scripture up there,
04:53 Colossians 2:8,  don’t be captive.
04:57 Captive.  That’s what Satan wants to do.
04:59 He wants to capture us.
05:01 We’ve heard of the poster  “Wanted Dead or Alive.”
05:05 He doesn’t want us dead;  he wants us alive.
05:08 Because why?
05:10 Well,  it’s an interesting verse in 2 Timothy;
05:13 it tells us why the Devil  would prefer to have us alive.
05:17 Second Timothy 2:26:
05:26 “And they may come to their senses  and escape from the snare of the Devil,
05:29 seeing that they have been caught alive by him to do his will.”
05:34 If you’re dead,  you can’t do Satan’s will.
05:37 So he wants to trap us alive
05:40 —or make us captive—
05:42 alive to do his will.
05:44 So, what do we need to do to keep  from being trapped by Satan? is the question.
05:49 Well, we read that one sentence  in our comments
05:52 to quickly identify tendencies.
05:56 OK.  Now, where do the tendencies start?
05:59 This is an August 1, 1996, Watchtower,
06:03 page 12, paragraph 12,
06:05 and here’s what it says:
06:07 “Unholy actions are not just spontaneous
06:12 “or without prior basis.
06:14 “They are the result of defiling thoughts
06:17 that have been lurking in the heart.”
06:21 That’s what happened to Judas Iscariot.
06:24 Here was an individual that had
06:27 a very deep spiritual taproot,  so to speak.
06:30 And apparently,  Jesus didn’t know
06:32 that Judas would be  the one betraying Him
06:35 when he was appointed  as an apostle.
06:37 Sometime in 32 C.E.,  Jesus told his apostles:
06:42 “One of you is a slanderer.”
06:45 Apparently, by that time,  he had identified Judas as that one.
06:49 Possibly by his actions,
06:51 a perfect man, Jesus,  could identify it early.
06:55 And the Scriptures say
06:57 as a result of Judas  acting on his thoughts,
07:02 Satan entered into Judas.
07:05 In other words,  now he was going
07:08 to do the will of Satan.
07:11 But before that all happened,
07:14 there had to have been some wrong thinking
07:18 lurking in the heart of Judas.
07:20 What could it have been?
07:22 Well, it could have involved malice,
07:25 maybe greed, pride,
07:28 hypocrisy, scheming.
07:30 Somewhere in there was  something that wasn’t right;
07:34 it was going to offend Jehovah God.
07:36 And he didn’t rip it out;  he didn’t take care of it,
07:39 and look what happened to Judas.
07:42 So, what about us?
07:44 What’s lurking in our heart?
07:47 Now we all may be individuals  with this deep spiritual taproot.
07:52 We’ve been in the truth many years;  we’ve been at Bethel many years.
07:56 Or we may be young people,
07:59 and we’re serving Jehovah well right now,
08:01 but all of us  have these improper thoughts
08:05 that we have to deal with.
08:07 Perhaps it could be something like this:
08:09 Maybe there is some scheming going on in our heart and mind,
08:14 maybe scheming of where we’re going  to get the next drink of alcohol.
08:18 Maybe it’s an evil thought against someone  that’s lurking in our heart.
08:23 Maybe it is a plan of action  of how we can see pornography
08:27 or perhaps an unhealthy attraction
08:30 to someone of the opposite sex.
08:34 If that’s the case,  what can we do?
08:37 Remember Isaiah 30:21.
08:40 It says to hear Jehovah’s voice  “behind you saying, ‘This is the way.’”
08:44 Don’t give in to Satan’s way,  but listen to Jehovah God.
08:49 Jehovah God has given us so many things
08:53 that can help us to address
08:55 the wrong thinking  that’s lurking in our hearts.
08:59 In fact, he gives us guidance  in his Word, the Bible.
09:04 Just think of all the scriptures  that we can use,
09:07 no matter what tendency we may have,
09:09 that can address those tendencies.
09:12 He gives us the holy spirit.
09:14 Jesus conveys the voice of Jehovah God.
09:18 He does so by means of the congregation
09:20 through the direction  of “the faithful and discreet slave.”
09:24 So if we are unable
09:28 to remove an improper tendency,
09:31 then get help
09:33 before Satan captures us to do his will.

00:01.250 --> 00:04.387
A little deeper study 
helps you to draw close to Jehovah. 


00:04.387 --> 00:08.057
The interactions that Jehovah 
has with his faithful servants


00:08.057 --> 00:10.594
—we think about them, 
we meditate on them, 


00:10.593 --> 00:13.530
it actually becomes a personal matter. 


00:13.530 --> 00:16.132
Drawing close to God becomes personal, 


00:16.132 --> 00:20.037
and then we can use that 
in our circumstances in life. 


00:20.037 --> 00:23.674
If we are dealing with a sickness 
or the illness of a mate 


00:23.673 --> 00:26.375
or even with the great tribulation 
in the offing, 


00:26.375 --> 00:29.512
how are we going to handle 
our relationship with Jehovah? 


00:29.512 --> 00:31.514
How are we going to stay strong?


00:31.513 --> 00:34.116
Well, we had this beautiful drama 


00:34.117 --> 00:36.887
“O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You,” 


00:36.887 --> 00:40.890
the Hezekiah drama, 
that we had for our regional convention. 


00:40.890 --> 00:44.560
Since that is still ringing very clearly 
in our minds and hearts, 


00:44.560 --> 00:49.232
let’s open our Bibles 
to 2 Kings chapter 19. 


00:49.232 --> 00:53.637
Let’s review a few thoughts 
from the life of Hezekiah 


00:53.637 --> 00:57.540
and that time period with Sennacherib
—the king of Assyria—


00:57.540 --> 01:00.577
the attack on Jerusalem 
in the year 732 B.C.E., 


01:00.577 --> 01:03.647
and Isaiah’s words to Hezekiah. 


01:03.647 --> 01:06.015
Again, with the focus of: 


01:06.015 --> 01:09.085
‘How can I draw close to Jehovah God? 


01:09.085 --> 01:11.888
What can this account 
continue to teach me?’


01:11.888 --> 01:15.000
So chapter 19, 
let’s start with verse 6: 


01:16.760 --> 01:20.763
“Isaiah said to them: 
‘This is what you should say to your lord, 


01:20.763 --> 01:22.665
“This is what Jehovah says.”’” 


01:22.665 --> 01:26.602
Now this was to Hezekiah: 
“Do not be afraid.” 


01:26.602 --> 01:30.140
Four words, but so powerful. 
Why? 


01:30.140 --> 01:32.908
Because positive assurance, Hezekiah, 


01:32.908 --> 01:35.076
that Sennacherib will be defeated. 


01:35.077 --> 01:39.449
‘Do not be afraid 
because I’ve heard all the things 


01:39.448 --> 01:44.000
that Sennacherib has said, 
and he’s blasphemed me.’ 


01:45.155 --> 01:47.323
“Do not be afraid.” 


01:47.323 --> 01:50.693
Think about that. 
It engenders confidence. 


01:50.693 --> 01:53.530
It engenders in us 
to approach Jehovah God. 


01:53.530 --> 01:56.933
He wants to help us. 
He wanted to help Hezekiah. 


01:56.933 --> 01:59.001
He saw his situation. 


01:59.002 --> 02:02.605
Hezekiah was emerging 
as one of the greatest kings of all Israel. 


02:02.605 --> 02:05.642
He was beating the odds. 
He had an apostate father. 


02:05.642 --> 02:09.879
And yet, Jehovah had his eye on Hezekiah 
and wanted to help him. 


02:09.878 --> 02:12.081
“Do not be afraid.” 


02:12.082 --> 02:17.787
You see, trusting in Jehovah 
as Hezekiah did is an act of worship. 


02:17.787 --> 02:21.490
It’s something that gets Jehovah’s blessing.


02:21.490 --> 02:25.228
When Jehovah tells us 
under our circumstances: 


02:25.228 --> 02:27.230
“Do not be afraid. 
I will help you. 


02:27.230 --> 02:31.167
I want to help you,” 
that helps us to be loyal to him. 


02:31.167 --> 02:33.169
We draw close to him. 


02:33.168 --> 02:35.938
Now when we show loyalty to Jehovah, 


02:35.938 --> 02:38.741
then he acts in loyalty toward us. 


02:38.742 --> 02:41.077
There’s an action; it’s not passive. 


02:41.077 --> 02:43.412
He acts in loyalty toward us. 


02:43.412 --> 02:45.415
He gives us his holy spirit. 


02:45.415 --> 02:47.417
He draws closer to us. 


02:47.417 --> 02:51.320
We feel his support; 
we can sense that he has helped us. 


02:51.320 --> 02:55.892
Our personal relationship with Jehovah 
becomes more keen, you see. 


02:55.892 --> 02:59.595
And that is because Jehovah 
is telling us as our heavenly Father, 


02:59.595 --> 03:01.097
“Do not be afraid.” 


03:01.097 --> 03:04.934
He did that to Hezekiah, 
and he does it with us. 


03:04.933 --> 03:07.000
It’s part of drawing close to him.


03:08.003 --> 03:12.275
Next, Hezekiah senses 
what really is important, 


03:12.275 --> 03:14.277
and this is so valuable to you and me. 


03:14.277 --> 03:17.000
Let’s go now to verse 19: 


03:18.848 --> 03:21.383
“But now, O Jehovah our God, 


03:21.383 --> 03:23.820
please save us out of his hand,” 


03:23.820 --> 03:26.222
now that is Sennacherib’s hand, 
we know that, 


03:26.222 --> 03:30.294
“so that all the kingdoms 
of the earth may know 


03:30.293 --> 03:34.363
that you alone are God, O Jehovah.” 


03:34.363 --> 03:38.735
So “all the kingdoms of the earth,” see, 


03:38.735 --> 03:41.972
Hezekiah was interested in Jehovah’s name


03:41.972 --> 03:44.140
—the sanctification of that name. 


03:44.140 --> 03:47.810
He was interested 
in the reputation of Jehovah God. 


03:47.810 --> 03:50.280
Now, he didn’t talk about himself,


03:50.280 --> 03:53.115
but he just spoke about Jehovah God.


03:53.115 --> 03:56.318
And again, that is the lesson 
that we can learn. 


03:56.318 --> 03:58.086
If we’re going to draw close to Jehovah, 


03:58.087 --> 04:01.890
we think about his reputation, his name, 


04:01.890 --> 04:04.927
we think about the issue 
of universal sovereignty, 


04:04.927 --> 04:09.132
we think about what that Kingdom 
is going to do to cleanse the earth. 


04:09.132 --> 04:13.737
Now, I know that oftentimes 
we think about our own suffering 


04:13.737 --> 04:16.305
and ‘I need to get into the new world.’ 


04:16.305 --> 04:19.108
And we think about the relief 
that we’re going to have, 


04:19.108 --> 04:21.110
and that is, of course, important. 


04:21.110 --> 04:23.813
But the core issues
—the greater issues—


04:23.813 --> 04:25.881
are Jehovah’s name, 


04:25.882 --> 04:28.752
proving the Devil a liar, 


04:28.752 --> 04:31.020
our loyalty at this time. 


04:31.020 --> 04:34.123
This is what Jehovah is looking at. 
This is the real issue.


04:34.123 --> 04:37.460
Imagine as the great tribulation approaches 


04:37.460 --> 04:40.095
how delightful, 
how exciting, it’s going to be 


04:40.095 --> 04:42.932
as we see even 
“the sign of the Son of man.” 


04:42.932 --> 04:45.669
There at Matthew 24:30, 


04:45.668 --> 04:47.703
some supernatural demonstration 


04:47.703 --> 04:49.705
displayed of Christ’s kingly power 


04:49.705 --> 04:52.942
as Jehovah demonstrates His sovereignty. 


04:52.942 --> 04:55.579
“All the kingdoms of the earth” 


04:55.578 --> 04:58.446
must know that Jehovah is God. 


04:58.447 --> 05:01.317
Again, thinking about these things 


05:01.317 --> 05:05.322
really brings our attention 
to the important things in life, 


05:05.322 --> 05:09.292
and it helps us 
to draw close to Jehovah God.


05:09.292 --> 05:11.294
Let’s go a little bit further. 


05:11.293 --> 05:13.295
Let’s look at verse 28. 


05:13.295 --> 05:16.032
Now here, 


05:16.032 --> 05:19.169
Sennacherib is going to learn 
a big lesson, we know. 


05:19.168 --> 05:21.836
Verse 28: “Because your rage,” 


05:21.837 --> 05:25.342
now, Jehovah is speaking to Sennacherib, 
of course, through Isaiah. 


05:25.342 --> 05:27.844
‘Because your rage against me 


05:27.843 --> 05:30.980
‘and your roaring 
have reached my ears. 


05:30.980 --> 05:34.483
‘I’m going to put a hook in your nose 
and a bridle in your lips, 


05:34.483 --> 05:37.553
‘and I’m going to lead you back 
to the way you came,’ 


05:37.553 --> 05:38.688
right back to Nineveh. 


05:38.688 --> 05:41.190
Sennacherib, 
you made a big mistake 


05:41.190 --> 05:43.693
by planting yourself in the land 
that I gave my people. 


05:43.693 --> 05:45.828
You made a big mistake. 
You shouldn’t have done that. 


05:45.828 --> 05:47.830
You’re used to putting hooks 


05:47.830 --> 05:50.232
in the noses of other people 
and bridles in their lips. 


05:50.232 --> 05:52.869
Well, I’m going to put a hook in your nose 
and drag you right back, 


05:52.868 --> 05:54.870
yank you back to Nineveh.


05:54.870 --> 05:55.972
This is encouraging. 


05:55.972 --> 05:59.509
This helps us to see exactly 
what Jehovah God is going to do 


05:59.508 --> 06:01.276
to this modern-day Assyrian 


06:01.277 --> 06:04.680
as they try to attack us 
in the near future. 


06:04.680 --> 06:07.583
Whether it be the modern-day Assyrian 
or ‘Gog of Magog,’ 


06:07.583 --> 06:09.585
“the king of the north,” 
“the kings of the earth,” 


06:09.585 --> 06:11.620
they don’t stand a chance. 


06:11.620 --> 06:15.000
This helps us to draw close 
to Jehovah God.


06:16.992 --> 06:19.129
Now verse 29. 


06:19.128 --> 06:22.898
Imagine this time period as we saw 
through that beautiful drama. 


06:22.898 --> 06:25.033
How are they going to eat? 
What are they going to eat? 


06:25.033 --> 06:26.901
With the Assyrian invasion, 


06:26.902 --> 06:29.972
it’s not possible 
to have a harvest to sow seed. 


06:29.972 --> 06:31.974
What would they do? 


06:31.973 --> 06:36.045
Verse 29: 
“And this will be the sign,” 


06:36.045 --> 06:39.548
a miraculous sign,
 “for you,” Hezekiah, 


06:39.548 --> 06:43.585
“This year you will eat 
what grows on its own.” 


06:43.585 --> 06:45.588
So imagine that! 


06:45.588 --> 06:47.390
Jehovah says: “Don’t worry! 


06:47.390 --> 06:49.725
“From those spilled kernels 
from last year, 


06:49.725 --> 06:52.128
“I’m going to have food shoot up 


06:52.128 --> 06:55.396
from the old grain from last year.” 


06:55.397 --> 06:57.434
That is amazing! 


06:57.433 --> 06:59.968
A miraculous provision of food.


06:59.968 --> 07:02.971
And then notice it goes on, it says: 


07:02.972 --> 07:05.842
“And in the second year 


07:05.842 --> 07:07.944
you will eat grain 
that sprouts from that.” 


07:07.943 --> 07:09.945
So again, even the second year, 


07:09.945 --> 07:12.282
but what is even more interesting, 


07:12.282 --> 07:14.617
according to Bible chronology, 


07:14.617 --> 07:19.222
that second year would be 
a Sabbath year of the Jubilee cycle. 


07:19.222 --> 07:21.557
And the Sabbath year of the Jubilee cycle, 


07:21.557 --> 07:25.260
the faithful Jews would not be able to plant; 
they wouldn’t sow seed; 


07:25.260 --> 07:29.232
they would let the land 
lay dormant or let it rest. 


07:29.232 --> 07:33.302
And Jehovah said, 
“I’m still going to provide for you.” 


07:33.302 --> 07:35.304
And then, of course, 
it goes on and says: 


07:35.303 --> 07:40.943
‘In the third year you can sow seed 
and reap a harvest.’ 


07:40.943 --> 07:43.178
You see the faith it must have taken 


07:43.178 --> 07:46.081
on the part of these faithful Jews 
at that time. 


07:46.082 --> 07:49.052
Would they really trust 
that sufficient crops would be available 


07:49.052 --> 07:52.889
for two years in a row 
without working their fields? 


07:52.888 --> 07:54.890
How would you have felt? 


07:54.890 --> 07:57.327
Maybe it was going through their minds: 


07:57.327 --> 07:59.995
‘Well, maybe we should go to Sennacherib. 


07:59.995 --> 08:02.632
‘He’s offering us food. 
He’s offering us survival. 


08:02.632 --> 08:04.100
Maybe we should surrender.’ 


08:04.100 --> 08:06.468
This was portrayed 
in the drama so beautifully.


08:06.468 --> 08:09.438
So again, what’s the big point for us? 


08:09.438 --> 08:11.973
Jehovah wants to help us, 


08:11.973 --> 08:14.543
and we draw close to Jehovah God knowing 


08:14.543 --> 08:17.111
that as the great tribulation 
even approaches, 


08:17.112 --> 08:19.815
geographical location has no bearing 


08:19.815 --> 08:22.885
on Jehovah rendering assistance 
to his people. 


08:22.885 --> 08:24.887
But now is the time: 


08:24.887 --> 08:27.790
As we study these accounts, 
we draw close to Jehovah, 


08:27.790 --> 08:30.560
we gain confidence—trusting him, 


08:30.560 --> 08:34.063
being loyal, 
knowing that he will loyally support us 


08:34.063 --> 08:36.098
under any circumstances. 


08:36.098 --> 08:38.233
So meditating on these accounts 


08:38.233 --> 08:41.536
should help us to continue 
to stay loyal, 


08:41.537 --> 08:45.909
not be afraid 
as God’s enemies will not succeed, 


08:45.908 --> 08:48.776
keeping focused 
that “all the kingdoms of the earth” 


08:48.777 --> 08:50.880
must know that Jehovah is God 


08:50.880 --> 08:55.317
and that his sovereignty 
will be the main issue in the universe, 


08:55.317 --> 08:58.487
and that Jehovah’s fatherly eye is upon us 


08:58.487 --> 09:01.324
as we continue to draw close to God 


09:01.323 --> 09:10.016
and serve him for an eternity.

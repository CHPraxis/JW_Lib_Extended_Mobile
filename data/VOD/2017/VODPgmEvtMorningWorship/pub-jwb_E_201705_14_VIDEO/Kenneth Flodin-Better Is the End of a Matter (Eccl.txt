00:02 Our text, Ecclesiastes 7:8,
00:05 says in its entirety:
00:07 ‘Better is the end of a matter
00:09 than the beginning.’
00:11 But then it adds:  ‘Better to be patient
00:13 than to show a haughty spirit.’
00:16 Well, if we’re patient,
00:18 sometimes a very grim-looking circumstance
00:21 becomes much better in the end
00:23 than we could have ever imagined  at the beginning.
00:26 Well, do we have a Bible example
00:29 where this principle  actually plays out that way?
00:32 First Kings chapter 20, please
00:35 —1 Kings 20.
00:38 King Ben-hadad of Syria  and 32 other kings
00:42 are fighting against Israel.
00:44 So the beginning  is not looking very good for Israel.
00:49 In fact, if you look at verse 7,
1 Kings 20:7,
00:53 it says that “the king of Israel  called all the elders of the land and said:
00:56 “‘Take note, please,  and see that this man [Ben-hadad]
01:00 “‘is bent on bringing calamity,
01:03 “‘for he demanded my wives,  my sons, my silver, and my gold,
01:07 and I did not refuse him.’”
01:09 Well, pretty bleak-looking circumstances.
01:13 But then after another interchange  between the two kings,
01:16 it’s obvious that Ben-hadad  was haughty.
01:19 In verse 10, you can almost see him  swaggering when he says:
01:23 “So may the gods do to me and add to it
01:26 “if there is enough dust in Samaria
01:28 to give each of the people  following me a handful!”
01:32 Well, again,  the beginning looks grim.
01:36 But then Ahab, in response,
01:40 he basically uses  the principle of our text for today.
01:43 In verse 11:  “The king of Israel answered:
01:46 “‘Tell him, “The one who puts on his armor  [you see, in the beginning]
01:51 “‘“should not boast about himself
01:53 like one who takes it off  [in the end].”’”
01:56 Well, the end of the matter  proved much better for Israel.
02:00 Verse 21 says that the king of Israel
02:02 “inflicted a great defeat on the Syrians.”
02:05 Better was the end of the matter  than its beginning.
02:09 Well, do we have another example  where it states it very similarly?
02:13 Yes, Judges —Judges 15.
02:16 This is one of the accounts  about Samson,
02:18 and Samson wreaked havoc.
02:21 He wreaked destruction  upon the Philistines.
02:24 So much so  that they are now coming
02:26 to Judah in all-out revenge.
02:29 Well, the men of Judah realized this,
02:30 and they’re worried  about being slaughtered.
02:33 So they caught up with Samson
02:35 and handed him  over to the Philistines.
02:38 In 15:13
02:41 the situation appears grim  for Samson at first.
02:45 Thirteen says in the last sentence:
02:47 “They bound him with two new ropes  and brought him up from the crag.”
02:51 Well, the haughty Philistines were thrilled
02:53 to have him bound  and just handed over to them.
02:56 In fact, in verse 14 it says:  “When he came to Lehi,
02:59 the Philistines shouted triumphantly  at meeting him.”
03:02 They couldn’t wait  to get their hands on him.
03:05 Well, how did the situation for Samson
03:09 prove better in the end  than at the beginning?
03:13 Well, the verse says  that “Jehovah’s spirit empowered him”
03:15 and the fetters  just “melted off his hands.”
03:18 And then in 15 and 16,
03:20 Samson finds the jawbone of a donkey
03:23 and he struck down  a thousand Philistines.
03:26 For Samson, the end of the matter  was better than the beginning.
03:31 Well, how about Job?
03:33 Job 42
03:35 —Job 42.
03:37 We’re all familiar with how Job’s tests
03:40 in the beginning were so trialsome
03:43 —one tragic circumstance after another—
03:46 and then he was humiliated  with verbal abuse
03:48 from his false comforters.
03:50 It can’t get much worse than that.
03:53 But because  of his endurance and patience,
03:56 how did it turn out in the end?
03:58 Well, verse 12 sounds very much  like our text for today.
04:02 Job 42:12, it says:
04:05 “So Jehovah blessed  the last part of Job’s life
04:09 more than the beginning.”
04:11 Well, how has this scripture,
04:15 Ecclesiastes 7:8,  been treated in our literature?
04:17 How has it been applied?
04:18 A couple of examples:
04:20 A 1998 Watchtower applied it  to parents counseling their children.
04:26 Now, for some during their teen years,
04:30 they go through a phase in life
04:32 and their attitude  is very frustrating to the parent.
04:35 In fact, during the teen years,  sometimes a parent will think,
04:38 ‘There’s no hope for this child.’
04:40 But if they’re patient,  what often results?
04:44 Oh, we’ve read countless experiences  in our magazines
04:47 and heard them on JW Broadcasting  of a wayward teen
04:51 who is now an adult  faithfully serving Jehovah.
04:56 Better was the end of the matter  than its beginning.
04:59 A 1994 Watchtower applied this  to one who feels
05:04 that he’s being overlooked  for privileges.
05:06 Well, instead of manifesting  a prideful spirit,
05:09 how much better to wait patiently.
05:12 In time, when that privilege  comes our way,
05:15 the end of the matter  is much better than at first.
05:19 Some years ago,
05:22 an older brother  who had been serving as an elder
05:24 moved to a new congregation.
05:26 Well, the elders in the new congregation  did not reappoint him right away.
05:30 A couple of years went by,  and he was appointed
05:33 as a ministerial servant,  not an elder.
05:37 Well, a couple more years went by,
05:39 and the former elder  is now doing a slow burn inside.
05:43 And it manifested itself  in his comments,
05:46 even being critical of some  of the decisions of the elders.
05:50 Well, please find  Philippians 2 with me.
05:54 One of the elders on that body  spoke to the brother,
05:59 and he explained  that with his current disturbed attitude,
06:03 it was very unlikely the body of elders would welcome him aboard.
06:08 He explained that his attitude  was rooted in his view of position.
06:12 And the elder used Philippians 2:5-9.
06:16 Now, verse 5 counsels that we’re to have  the “mental attitude” of Jesus.
06:20 Well, what was Jesus’ attitude  about position?
06:24 Verse 6 —it’s talking about position—
06:27 it says that Jesus did not try  to seize Jehovah’s position.
06:32 And verse 7,  just the opposite of going up the ladder,
06:36 Jesus was willing  to go down the ladder
06:39 to assume a lower position —become a human.
06:43 And then verse 8 says:
06:45 “More than that, when he came as a man,  he humbled himself
06:50 and became obedient to the point of death,
06:53 yes, death on a torture stake.”
06:55 And then the bottom line,  in verse 9:
06:58 “For this very reason.”
07:00 For what reason?
07:02 Because of Jesus’ humble attitude
07:05 in accepting a lesser assignment
07:08 to do Jehovah’s further will.
07:09 And what was the result?
07:11 The verse continues:
07:12 “For this very reason,  God exalted him to a superior position
07:16 and . . . gave him [a] name . . .  above every other name.”
07:19 Well, the elder  asked the brother if he thought
07:22 that he was manifesting  the “mental attitude” of Jesus,
07:26 and that brother said, “No.”
07:29 He said, “I’m too caught up  in the position of being an elder.”
07:33 So the elder asked him,  “Well, what are you going to do?”
07:36 The older brother said,
07:38 “I need to reach out  for the office of overseer all over again
07:43 and stop sulking about my position.”
07:46 Well, what was the result?
07:48 For years he had not been reappointed  as an elder.
07:51 Six months after that conversation,
07:55 the body of elders  unanimously recommended
07:57 he be appointed as an elder.
07:59 Why?
08:01 Ecclesiastes 7:8:
08:03 “Better to be patient than . . .  haughty in spirit.”
08:07 Well, that older brother,  he died some years later,
08:11 happily serving as an elder.
08:13 Better was the end of the matter  than its beginning.
08:17 Another application of the verse:
08:22 In the beginning,  in the rebellion in Eden,
08:24 it looked very bleak  for the human family.
08:26 But Jehovah had an arrangement  to rectify matters,
08:29 Jesus cooperated,  and what does that result in
08:31 for you and me if we remain faithful?
08:34 No question about it
08:36 —our reward at the end of this system
08:39 will be better than at the first!

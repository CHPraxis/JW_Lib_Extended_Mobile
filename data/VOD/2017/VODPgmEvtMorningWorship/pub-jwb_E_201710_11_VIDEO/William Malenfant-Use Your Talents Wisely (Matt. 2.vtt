00:01.283 --> 00:03.720
In the printed comments on today’s text,


00:03.720 --> 00:06.588
a reference is made to Matthew 25


00:06.588 --> 00:08.891
and Luke 19.


00:08.892 --> 00:10.894
In Matthew 25,


00:10.893 --> 00:13.796
we have the illustration of the talents


00:13.797 --> 00:16.365
—three slaves who received talents.


00:16.365 --> 00:19.968
One slave receives five, another two,


00:19.968 --> 00:22.638
and a third slave receives one talent.


00:22.638 --> 00:26.541
And in Luke 19,
the illustration is about ten slaves


00:26.542 --> 00:30.480
with each slave receiving one mina.


00:30.480 --> 00:35.052
These were all sums of money,
you could say, talents or the minas.


00:35.052 --> 00:40.057
Both illustrations were given
some days before Jesus died,


00:40.057 --> 00:42.692
and they were given in different places.


00:42.692 --> 00:46.029
The illustration about the minas
was given in Jericho.


00:46.028 --> 00:50.133
The illustration about the talents
that Jesus gave to his apostles


00:50.133 --> 00:52.135
was on the Mount of Olives.


00:52.135 --> 00:56.472
But there’s a key point
in each illustration that we’ll focus on:


00:56.472 --> 00:59.542
The slave in each account


00:59.542 --> 01:02.379
who did nothing with his talent or his mina


01:02.378 --> 01:05.615
is described as “wicked.”


01:05.615 --> 01:10.587
That’s a powerful denunciation
for someone to be called “wicked,”


01:10.587 --> 01:13.122
particularly by the Master.


01:13.122 --> 01:15.925
But to see how powerful it is,


01:15.925 --> 01:18.762
at Matthew 6:13,


01:18.762 --> 01:22.732
Jesus refers to Satan as “the wicked one.”


01:22.732 --> 01:25.369
And Proverbs 10:7 says:


01:25.368 --> 01:28.336
“The name of the wicked will rot.”


01:28.337 --> 01:33.142
So that is a very strong term
to apply to any human.


01:33.142 --> 01:34.944
But why?


01:34.943 --> 01:38.915
Why are these two slaves
described as “wicked”?


01:38.915 --> 01:42.185
Jesus didn’t say they broke
any of the Ten Commandments.


01:42.185 --> 01:47.023
No, but they did something
that was extremely serious:


01:47.023 --> 01:49.825
They failed to do something


01:49.825 --> 01:53.563
with the talents or the minas
that they were given;


01:53.563 --> 01:57.766
they were guilty of sins of omission.


01:57.767 --> 02:00.370
In Jesus’ parable,
just to give you an example,


02:00.370 --> 02:05.375
of the sheep and the goats
at Matthew 25:41-46,


02:05.375 --> 02:08.143
you remember in the account
how the goats are condemned


02:08.143 --> 02:10.913
to “everlasting cutting-off”


02:10.913 --> 02:13.348
—not for doing something bad,


02:13.348 --> 02:17.186
but because the scripture says
that they didn’t help Christ’s brothers.


02:17.187 --> 02:19.222
Again, it was a sin of omission


02:19.222 --> 02:22.992
—not doing something
that they should have done.


02:22.992 --> 02:26.762
It’s also interesting to note
that in Matthew’s account,


02:26.762 --> 02:30.634
the talents were given to the slaves
“according to [their] ability.”


02:30.633 --> 02:33.101
So one received five, one received two,


02:33.102 --> 02:35.339
and the third one, one talent.


02:35.338 --> 02:37.373
Was the master being partial?


02:37.373 --> 02:39.375
No, not at all.


02:39.375 --> 02:43.112
The account explains clearly
that the talents were given to the slaves


02:43.112 --> 02:45.815
“according to [their] ability.”


02:45.815 --> 02:49.118
So that was really being considerate
on the part of the master


02:49.118 --> 02:51.720
—the way he apportioned
the responsibilities


02:51.720 --> 02:53.723
to work for his interests,


02:53.723 --> 02:55.825
to increase his belongings.


02:55.825 --> 02:58.027
And, you know, 
that’s a very comforting thought 


02:58.027 --> 02:59.829
for all of us:


02:59.828 --> 03:03.431
to realize that Jehovah
takes into account what we can do


03:03.432 --> 03:08.805
—not comparing us
with others in the congregation.


03:08.805 --> 03:12.975
We have to be careful
about feeling worthless


03:12.975 --> 03:16.612
or devaluing our own worth,
because that can happen.


03:16.612 --> 03:20.182
We can feel we just can’t ever do enough 
to please Jehovah God,


03:20.182 --> 03:22.385
or there’s just too much going on.


03:22.385 --> 03:25.422
No, we just have to do
whatever we are able to do


03:25.422 --> 03:27.957
and give our best to Jehovah God.


03:27.957 --> 03:30.192
We never want to fall into the trap


03:30.192 --> 03:33.262
that the sluggish and wicked slave fell into.


03:33.262 --> 03:36.765
If you recall the account,
he started to criticize the master:


03:36.765 --> 03:39.035
“I know that you reap
what you haven’t sowed.


03:39.035 --> 03:40.870
“I know that you do this or that.


03:40.870 --> 03:42.472
You’re harsh.”


03:42.472 --> 03:45.207
He was really placing the blame
on the master 


03:45.207 --> 03:48.344
for his own inactivity
—for what he didn’t do.


03:48.343 --> 03:50.346
But the master turned the tables on him,


03:50.347 --> 03:52.049
and he said: 
“You say that I’m that way.


03:52.048 --> 03:53.415
Well, now ‘wicked slave.’ . . .”


03:53.415 --> 03:56.852
And then he told him
that he wasn’t going to receive anything.


03:56.852 --> 03:59.722
He was categorized as “wicked”!


03:59.722 --> 04:03.059
So as long as we give our best
—we give from the heart—


04:03.058 --> 04:05.193
Jehovah is going to bless us.


04:05.193 --> 04:08.030
And there’s another interesting thing too
with the slaves


04:08.030 --> 04:10.132
—the one slave who received five talents


04:10.132 --> 04:12.135
and the one who received two talents.


04:12.135 --> 04:14.670
The one who received two talents 
gained two talents. 


04:14.670 --> 04:17.440
The one who received five gained five. 


04:17.440 --> 04:20.943
But the one who had two 
and gained only two 


04:20.943 --> 04:23.078
didn’t look at the one
who gained five and say:


04:23.078 --> 04:25.080
“I can’t do what he did.


04:25.080 --> 04:26.848
I only received two talents.”


04:26.848 --> 04:30.553
No, he was just happy with what he had.


04:30.553 --> 04:32.555
Isn’t that a good lesson for us?


04:32.555 --> 04:35.892
Be happy with you
and with what you’re able to do.


04:35.892 --> 04:38.460
If you can reach out
and do more, wonderful!


04:38.460 --> 04:39.628
Do it.


04:39.628 --> 04:41.863
But we don’t want to start comparing,


04:41.863 --> 04:44.900
“I can’t keep up with him or with her.”


04:44.900 --> 04:47.570
That’s just a bad, bad idea,


04:47.570 --> 04:50.205
and it will not benefit anyone.


04:50.205 --> 04:54.743
What did the master say
to the slave who gained five talents


04:54.743 --> 04:56.411
—a total of ten talents?


04:56.412 --> 04:59.515
And that was a fortune in those days.


04:59.515 --> 05:02.000
Well, let’s see what the scripture says,
Matthew 25


05:05.755 --> 05:08.390
—Matthew 25:21.


05:08.390 --> 05:11.727
And these are the words of the master
to the slave who gained five talents,


05:11.727 --> 05:13.730
verse 21:


05:13.730 --> 05:18.233
“His master said to him:
‘Well done, good and faithful slave!


05:18.233 --> 05:20.770
“‘You were faithful over a few things.


05:20.770 --> 05:23.538
“‘I will appoint you over many things. 


05:23.538 --> 05:26.208
Enter into the joy of your master.’”


05:26.208 --> 05:29.045
What a reward from the master!


05:29.045 --> 05:32.148
But what did he say to the slave


05:32.148 --> 05:34.850
who gained only two talents?


05:34.850 --> 05:36.852
Verse 23:


05:36.852 --> 05:38.855
“His master said to him:


05:38.855 --> 05:41.223
“‘Well done, good and faithful slave!


05:41.223 --> 05:43.291
“‘You were faithful over a few things.


05:43.292 --> 05:45.495
“‘I will appoint you over many things.


05:45.495 --> 05:48.197
Enter into the joy of your master.’”


05:48.197 --> 05:51.534
Same, same
—isn’t that what it is?


05:51.533 --> 05:54.236
It was according to each one’s ability.


05:54.237 --> 05:57.074
The reward in each case was the same:


05:57.073 --> 05:59.675
the approval of the master and,


05:59.675 --> 06:02.845
undoubtedly, additional responsibilities.


06:02.845 --> 06:05.948
Put simply, the Master is Jesus Christ.


06:05.948 --> 06:09.018
The talents refer to the responsibility


06:09.018 --> 06:12.655
that Jehovah gives to his anointed servants;


06:12.655 --> 06:15.558
they have to preach and make disciples.


06:15.558 --> 06:17.893
That commission was given to the anointed.


06:17.893 --> 06:19.895
We of the other sheep,


06:19.895 --> 06:21.997
we have the responsibility 
to do the same thing,


06:21.997 --> 06:25.200
but that illustration was directed,
truly, to the anointed.


06:25.200 --> 06:29.038
But there is a scripture that helps us
to appreciate what we need to do,


06:29.038 --> 06:34.043
and it’s in Revelation chapter 22


06:34.043 --> 06:38.646
—Revelation 22:17.


06:38.647 --> 06:41.817
It’s not directly connected to the talents,


06:41.817 --> 06:45.522
but it does give us direction
on what we all should do


06:45.522 --> 06:48.024
—whether we’re of the anointed
or of the other sheep.


06:48.023 --> 06:50.960
Revelation 22:17 says:


06:50.960 --> 06:54.897
“And the spirit and the bride
keep on saying, ‘Come!’


06:54.897 --> 06:57.567
and let anyone hearing
say, ‘Come!’”


06:57.567 --> 07:00.637
Well, that would be “anyone hearing”
—we of the other sheep.


07:00.637 --> 07:02.739
Because the bride—
We know who the bride is.


07:02.738 --> 07:05.406
The bride is the anointed brothers of Christ.


07:05.407 --> 07:08.410
And then it says:
“And let anyone thirsting come;


07:08.410 --> 07:11.813
let anyone who wishes
take life’s water free.”


07:11.813 --> 07:14.150
Well, “the spirit” says “Come!”


07:14.150 --> 07:16.152
Yes, indeed!


07:16.152 --> 07:20.222
At Pentecost, holy spirit
was poured out upon 120 disciples.


07:20.222 --> 07:22.259
They could go out
and speak other languages.


07:22.258 --> 07:25.060
They were sharing the good news
—the hope—


07:25.060 --> 07:27.563
with Jews in Jerusalem at that time.


07:27.563 --> 07:31.033
The holy spirit inspired men
to write the Scriptures;


07:31.033 --> 07:34.536
holy spirit is behind the prophecies
that we read in the Bible.


07:34.537 --> 07:38.474
And the holy spirit is saying “Come!”
—isn’t it?—


07:38.473 --> 07:41.510
when you read a scripture to someone
about the time of the end


07:41.510 --> 07:43.980
(2 Timothy 3 or other scriptures)


07:43.980 --> 07:47.317
and they say,
“That’s what’s taking place today!”


07:47.317 --> 07:49.652
“Come on, ‘Come!’”


07:49.652 --> 07:54.357
The holy spirit is nudging,
urging people when they read God’s Word


07:54.357 --> 07:57.125
and they understand it
and they accept what it says.


07:57.125 --> 07:59.128
It says “Come!”


07:59.128 --> 08:01.130
What about the bride?


08:01.130 --> 08:05.968
Well, the bride’s been saying “Come!” 
for a long time.


08:05.968 --> 08:09.938
One hundred and twenty disciples
at Pentecost went down,


08:09.938 --> 08:12.308
they preached in different languages,
and they were saying


08:12.308 --> 08:14.310
to the Jews there, “Come!”


08:14.310 --> 08:16.578
And then down through the centuries,


08:16.578 --> 08:18.813
we know that the few there
who may have been of the bride class


08:18.813 --> 08:21.750
did their best to serve Jehovah 
and honor him.


08:21.750 --> 08:23.785
But in these last days


08:23.785 --> 08:27.490
is when it
has really expanded tremendously,


08:27.490 --> 08:29.492
with the bride saying “Come!”


08:29.492 --> 08:30.894
Think about it.


08:30.893 --> 08:33.628
From 120 disciples at Pentecost


08:33.628 --> 08:37.600
and preaching in one city
—in this case, Jerusalem—


08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
the work of the bride
has increased


08:39.602 --> 08:44.274
to 8,220,105 disciples


08:44.273 --> 08:47.075
in 240 lands.


08:47.075 --> 08:49.978
Has the bride been saying “Come!”?


08:49.978 --> 08:51.480
Absolutely!


08:51.480 --> 08:53.983
From one congregation at Pentecost


08:53.983 --> 08:58.253
—you could call
the 120 disciples a congregation—


08:58.253 --> 09:04.860
to 118,016 congregations worldwide.


09:04.860 --> 09:08.730
The Master, Jesus,
must be very happy, joyful,


09:08.730 --> 09:13.068
to see that his obedient slaves
have truly covered the earth


09:13.068 --> 09:15.070
with the Kingdom message.


09:15.070 --> 09:21.495
What a privilege we have
to share in that work!

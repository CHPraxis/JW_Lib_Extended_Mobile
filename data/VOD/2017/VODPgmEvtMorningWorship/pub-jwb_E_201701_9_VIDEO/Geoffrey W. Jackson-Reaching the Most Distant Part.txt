00:01 When we think of Acts 1:8,
00:04 we think of this challenging assignment
00:07 that the apostles were given,
00:10 and we can only just imagine  them thinking about
00:13 the other promise of “power”  and “holy spirit” being with them.
00:17 They certainly would need that to go  “to the most distant part of the earth.”
00:22 When we think back  to the first century,
00:24 we think of ones such as  the apostle Paul, Barnabas, Timothy,
00:28 and many others  who literally tried to go
00:31 as far as they could  to reach various territories.
00:35 If we take our Bibles  and turn to the book
00:37 of Romans 15:23, 24,
00:42 we see summarized here
00:45 the apostle Paul’s viewpoint  with regard to this.
00:48 Romans 15:23:
00:51 “But now I no longer have  untouched territory in these regions,
00:55 and for many years  I have longed to come to you.”
00:57 And that’s the brothers in Rome.
00:59 “Therefore, when I journey to Spain,  I hope that I will see you.”
01:03 So Paul was very concerned  about going to untouched territories.
01:08 Well, in recent times,
01:10 we can say the same  is true of Jehovah’s people,
01:13 whether it be the Gilead missionaries  who have been sent out
01:16 or other missionaries even prior
01:18 to the time of Gilead  being established.
01:21 Or we think of the brothers  who have moved to other countries
01:25 to serve where the need is greater
01:27 or perhaps those who  have gone out to unassigned territories
01:31 or helped in areas  where very few people
01:34 get the opportunity  to hear the message.
01:36 When we hear  those experiences,
01:38 we certainly are encouraged  by them, aren’t we?
01:42 But perhaps we  could think this morning
01:44 about just one of the aspects  of the history in the past.
01:48 It’s something referred to  in the March 2016 Watchtower,
01:52 in the “Questions From Readers.”
01:54 You remember this was discussing
01:56 the valley of dry bones  in Ezekiel 37.
02:01 It spoke about  the gradual restoration
02:04 of true worship,
02:06 and it made the comment  there that in the Scriptures,
02:09 it speaks of a “rattling” noise.
02:12 And The Watchtower  made this comment,
02:14 it said that even  prior to the time of the end,
02:17 there were some  faithful individuals
02:19 who stood up  in behalf of true worship.
02:21 Then it said:  “Some of them endeavored to produce Bibles
02:25 in the languages of the common people.”
02:28 So let’s just think  for a few moments about some of those
02:32 —perhaps less than 100 years
02:34 before the time that Brother Russell  started The Watchtower—
02:39 and how many  of those were motivated
02:42 to go to distant parts  of the earth
02:45 to translate the Bible  and help others there.
02:49 For example,  in the year 1793,
02:52 a man by the name  of William Carey
02:55 was a British shoemaker.
02:57 And this shoemaker  was very impressed with the words
03:02 recorded at Matthew 28:19, 20.
03:04 He felt strongly that all Christians  should follow that command.
03:09 So his goal was to go to India.
03:12 And he arrived in India  and faced all sorts of problems
03:16 —eventually his wife died,  his son died as well,
03:19 he had to take  a job planting indigo.
03:22 But this man, within 21 years,  with the help of some others,
03:26 was able to translate the Bible,  well, parts of it,
03:30 in 36 languages.
03:33 Then in 1797,
03:37 another man,  Henry Nott,
03:39 from England  was a bricklayer.
03:43 And he and quite a number  of others arrived in Tahiti.
03:47 Now, four of those on that ship
03:50 were noted to be pastors,
03:53 but they had  no formal training whatsoever.
03:56 Henry Nott hadn’t had  a very good education.
04:00 He was a bricklayer;  he just had the basic education.
04:04 But this very faithful man
04:06 decided to learn Hebrew and Greek
04:09 and translate the Bible into Tahitian.
04:12 And he learned Tahitian very quickly,
04:14 and in 1835,  after 30 years of translating,
04:18 it says that he put down his quill
04:21 and the Tahitian Bible, which,  incidentally, uses Jehovah’s name
04:25 in both the Hebrew  and the Greek sections of the Bible.
04:29 Then 1807,  Robert Morrison
04:33 —a man who was determined  to translate the Bible into Chinese.
04:37 He arrived in China to find out
04:39 that if anyone  taught a foreigner Chinese,
04:42 there was a death penalty.
04:44 So he remained indoors  for a couple of years
04:46 while he learned  the Chinese language.
04:49 And then when he  started to translate the Bible,
04:52 he found out the emperor  had stated there would be a death penalty
04:56 for anyone who printed  Christian literature in that country.
05:01 Well, in 1819,
05:03 Morrison completed  his version there of the Bible.
05:08 In 1812,  Judson, an American,
05:12 along with his wife,  left America
05:15 just after two weeks  of marriage and,
05:18 in 1813,  arrived in Burma,
05:21 which is now known  as Myanmar.
05:23 And his determination  was to translate
05:26 the Bible into the local language,  which was very hard there.
05:29 There was no dictionary;
05:31 there was no one  that could actually teach him,
05:34 and yet he set  to learning the language.
05:38 He had a period of time  where he was in prison
05:41 with three pairs of iron fetters  attached to his body.
05:45 And he was very concerned
05:48 about his Bible manuscript  that he’d been translating,
05:50 which was hidden  in the earth under his home.
05:53 His wife eventually brought it  to him in prison.
05:56 It was hidden in a pillow.
05:58 Well, this man,  by 1835,
06:02 had the Bible translated  into the local language there.
06:06 But not all of these  were white missionaries
06:09 from either America or England.
06:12 When the message  reached the Pacific, for example,
06:16 many local persons —Polynesians—
06:19 were very determined to go  to other islands within the Pacific
06:23 to spread the message.
06:25 An example of this is in 1823.
06:28 A man,  a Polynesian by the name of Papeiha,
06:31 was determined to get  the message in Rarotonga,
06:35 in the Cook Islands.
06:37 So the mission ship arrived there;
06:40 the two missionary couples  from overseas,
06:44 white missionaries,  were put ashore.
06:47 There was a misunderstanding  with a drunken king,
06:50 which resulted in them  being beaten up,
06:52 all their possessions  being stolen,
06:54 and them fleeing back  to the ship.
06:57 But Papeiha was determined
07:01 to take the Gospel message  to those islanders.
07:04 So it’s reported that he said  that he would swim ashore
07:08 and that he called out:
07:10 “Ko Jehova toku tiaki!
07:12 Tei roto au i tona rima!”
07:14 which translated means
07:16 “Jehovah is my shepherd!
07:18 I am in His hand!”
07:20 And holding a book  with some translations
07:22 of the Bible in Tahitian,
07:24 he jumped overboard,  swam ashore,
07:27 and started preaching  to the local people.
07:29 Well, you can’t help  but admire that enthusiasm.
07:33 The conditions  that these missionaries met
07:36 were very, very difficult,  very primitive conditions.
07:40 In one country,  the missionaries lived in villages
07:43 where people  still practiced cannibalism and,
07:47 in many cases,  when the chief died,
07:50 all his wives were executed  at that point and buried with him.
07:54 So in the midst  of these conditions,
07:57 these men translated  the Bible and, in many cases,
08:01 used Jehovah’s name  not only in the Bible
08:03 but in their personal writings.
08:06 What kept them going?
08:08 What helped them to go  to these distant parts of the earth?
08:12 Well, a book on the history  of the missionary work in the Pacific
08:16 makes this interesting comment.
08:18 It says:  “Strong faith in Jehovah
08:21 often overcame fear and despair.”
08:25 What an interesting thought.
08:27 Well, the obvious question is,
08:30 Were these ones anointed?
08:32 The answer obviously is,
08:34 We don’t know.
08:36 But we do know  that Jesus said in Matthew 13
08:40 there would be  wheatlike “sons of the Kingdom”
08:43 right down through history.
08:45 And if some of them  were involved with this type of work,
08:47 I’m sure we wouldn’t be surprised.
08:49 And in the future,  we will no doubt find out
08:52 if they were involved  with that work or not.
08:55 But what about us today?
08:57 Well, does it mean we  have to all leave our Bethel homes now
09:00 and go to the most distant parts  of the earth?
09:03 Well, remember,  in Acts 1:8,
09:05 Jesus was speaking to people  there in Jerusalem,
09:08 and you may already be living
09:10 in one of the most distant parts  of the earth
09:13 when you view it  from Jerusalem’s viewpoint.
09:16 But the main thing is,  wherever we are
09:19 —if we can reach out  and go somewhere else
09:22 or whether we can preach  within our own territory—
09:25 if we follow the example  of these faithful ones,
09:28 we’ll be sure to try  and reach out to persons
09:31 who have not had  the opportunity to hear the truth,
09:34 whether near or far.

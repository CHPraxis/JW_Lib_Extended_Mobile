00:03 Resting quietly between the Bay of Bengal  and the Andaman Sea
00:07 are the hundreds  of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
00:11 Around 30,000 people speak Nicobarese,
00:14 a language unique to these islands.
00:17 Some of our literature was translated
00:19 into Nicobarese in the early 2000’s,
00:22 but the time came for them
00:24 to have their own translation team.
00:27 So in 2007, the India branch
00:29 sent two brothers to organize it.
00:31 The brothers soon found many obstacles
00:34 to overcome  before the translation work could begin.
00:37 After searching for a while,  we found potential candidates
00:40 who could read, write,  and speak Nicobarese fluently
00:44 and we encouraged them  to use their skills for translation.
00:47 They really prepared their hearts  to benefit from the training given.
00:56 I was excited
00:58 and at the same time frightened.
01:00 I know the seriousness  of the responsibility
01:03 as translation is done for those  who do not understand another language.
01:10 The brother who came  to give training always told us,
01:13 “If you make yourself available,
01:16 Jehovah will make you capable.”
01:18 The best location for work  would have been on the Nicobar Islands
01:22 where the Nicobarese-speaking people live.
01:24 But it was restricted  after the devastating tsunami in 2004.
01:29 The brothers couldn’t leave  their jobs and go to the branch
01:32 because it’s  over 1,000 miles away (1,600 km).
01:35 So the capital of the islands,
01:37 Port Blair,  was the best place to work.
01:40 Some had to travel 24 hours by ship
01:43 from different islands to get there.
01:50 Our language has a limited vocabulary.
01:52 That is a challenge for us,
01:55 but as a team, we try to resolve it.
01:58 During the preparation,  if we find something
02:01 which is difficult to translate,
02:03 the three of us give our suggestions
02:05 and we try to find  a simpler way of translating
02:09 so the target audience gets the point.
02:16 In December 2004,
02:18 a tsunami devastated the islands
02:21 leaving many in search of comfort.
02:27 During the tsunami’s period,
02:29 those who never wanted to hear the good news
02:32 wanted to come in the small room
02:34 where we used to conduct our meetings.
02:36 So I told them
02:38 the meeting can be conducted  in the open ground
02:41 where all the tsunami victims  were gathering.
02:44 They agreed because they  were eager to hear the truth.
02:49 Soon afterward,  the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth?
02:53 was translated into Nicobarese.
02:55 It immediately had a positive effect.
02:59 When people saw the tract in their language,
03:02 they were very happy.
03:04 On one island,
03:06 more than 20 people read the tract.
03:09 Most of them
03:11 have now dedicated themselves  to serve Jehovah.
03:15 Among them
03:17 were Boniface Joseph  and his wife, Polina Lucas.
03:24 The last question affected us:
03:26 “How can I find happiness in life?”
03:28 We were happy because the way it answered
03:31 was very simple and easy to understand.
03:33 We were moved to learn  more about the truth.
03:36 There were other questions  we never knew before
03:39 such as “What happens to us when we die?”
03:42 and “Will . . . suffering ever end?”
03:45 Even though the tsunami  almost snatched away
03:48 everything some of these brothers had,
03:50 they are now even more determined
03:52 to use their abilities in Jehovah’s service.
03:56 In the field ministry,
03:58 I met a lady and gave her one of our tracts.
04:02 She was happy to see it in her own language
04:05 because it is totally a new thing to them
04:08 as we don’t have any secular magazines  in our own language.
04:12 People in the congregation benefit from it.
04:16 Even new Bible students  have benefited who did not read well,
04:20 but now they can understand  what they’re reading
04:23 because it’s in their language.
04:25 It reaches their heart.
04:29 Nicobari literature has helped me  to keep my faith strong
04:33 because now when I read,
04:34 I can fully understand the meaning
04:36 and meditate on what I’m reading.
04:40 I feel God uses translation as a tool
04:43 to help people  to know more about him
04:46 and attract them to the truth  and save their lives.
04:49 With Jehovah’s blessing,
04:51 the challenging work of translating
04:54 the good news of his Kingdom  into Nicobarese
04:57 is contributing to the words  of Isaiah 42:12:
05:01 “Let them attribute glory to Jehovah
05:04 and declare his praise in the islands.”

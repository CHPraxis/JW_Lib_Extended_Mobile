00:08 I was the first to start studying the Bible.
00:12 After that, I started studying too.
00:15 After watching them for a year,
00:17 I began studying too.
00:19 Since our parents had stopped studying,
00:22 only three of us went to the meetings.
00:27 We saved our allowance  to take the bus to meetings.
00:30 But sometimes when we were short of money—
00:32 My sisters let me ride the bus,
00:35 since I’m the youngest, and they would walk.
00:39 We used to walk an hour and a half each way.
00:45 Meetings were so important to us  that we never felt it was a burden.
00:48 May 2007.
00:51 For me, it was October 2006.
00:54 I was baptized in October 2005.
01:00 Three years later, I spent a week
01:02 with a special pioneer  who was serving in the countryside.
01:06 We prayed together every night
01:09 and read life stories from The Watchtower.
01:12 I told Jehovah that I wanted to be just like her.
01:18 Although my relatives  were unhappy with my decision,
01:21 with Jehovah’s help, I decided to become a pioneer.
01:25 I followed her example, and I became a pioneer too.
01:30 I was working six days a week  to support my family,
01:33 so I prayed to Jehovah  for the opportunity to become a pioneer.
01:38 After my boss reduced my work to five days a week,
01:40 I started pioneering.
01:45 Pioneer service gives you the opportunity
01:47 to serve Jehovah more fully.
01:50 Working closely with Jehovah, I really feel part of his family.
01:55 My relationship with Jehovah has gotten stronger.
01:59 When I pray now, it feels like I’m talking to my close friend.
02:03 It allows you to expand your ministry.
02:06 I became a special pioneer in June 2013.
02:10 I’ve served at Bethel since September 2013.
02:15 In April 2014, I was appointed a special pioneer.
02:21 Now I can serve Jehovah more fully.
02:24 My appreciation for Jehovah has deepened.
02:28 Our mother, who had opposed us, became a pioneer too.
02:32 Full-time service is—
02:34 —really awesome!

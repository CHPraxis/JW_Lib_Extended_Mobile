00:25 The trunk of the African elephant
00:28 is an impressive multitool.
00:31 It is both flexible
00:34 and strong.
00:37 It can pick up a blade of grass
00:41 or uproot a tree.
00:47 Some elephants can use  their trunks to feed themselves
00:51 around 270 kilograms (600 lbs)  of vegetation
00:54 every day.
01:04 With their trunks,
01:06 they can suck water like a straw,
01:15 spray like a fountain,
01:17 and swim with a snorkel.
01:24 The trunk can give a gentle touch,
01:30 give a strong push,
01:33 or sound a warning trumpet.
01:37 Engineers admire  the elephant trunk’s remarkable flexibility.
01:42 This comes from having no bone.
01:44 Instead, it contains
01:46 about 150,000 muscle units
01:50 —an incredible marriage  of strength and structure.
01:55 Inspired by the elephant’s trunk, researchers are designing robots
01:59 for the future with greater flexibility.
02:02 Industrial design often can be made better by copying
02:07 the perfectly beautiful solutions  in the natural world.

00:25.795 --> 00:28.840
The trunk of the African elephant 


00:28.840 --> 00:31.927
is an impressive multitool. 


00:31.927 --> 00:34.137
It is both flexible 


00:34.137 --> 00:37.432
and strong. 


00:37.432 --> 00:41.229
It can pick up a blade of grass 


00:41.228 --> 00:44.000
or uproot a tree.


00:47.192 --> 00:51.030
Some elephants can use 
their trunks to feed themselves 


00:51.030 --> 00:54.950
around 270 kilograms (600 lbs) 
of vegetation 


00:54.950 --> 00:57.000
every day.


01:04.918 --> 01:06.920
With their trunks, 


01:06.920 --> 01:09.000
they can suck water like a straw, 


01:15.053 --> 01:17.388
spray like a fountain, 


01:17.388 --> 01:21.000
and swim with a snorkel.


01:24.605 --> 01:28.000
The trunk can give a gentle touch, 


01:30.110 --> 01:33.947
give a strong push, 


01:33.947 --> 01:37.827
or sound a warning trumpet.


01:37.827 --> 01:41.000
Engineers admire 
the elephant trunk’s remarkable flexibility. 


01:42.163 --> 01:44.666
This comes from having no bone. 


01:44.667 --> 01:46.835
Instead, it contains 


01:46.835 --> 01:50.797
about 150,000 muscle units


01:50.797 --> 01:55.010
—an incredible marriage 
of strength and structure.


01:55.010 --> 01:59.432
Inspired by the elephant’s trunk,
researchers are designing robots


01:59.432 --> 02:02.475
for the future with greater flexibility.


02:02.475 --> 02:07.773
Industrial design
often can be made better by copying 


02:07.773 --> 02:11.026
the perfectly beautiful solutions 
in the natural world.


02:11.027 --> 02:13.945
What do you think? 


02:13.945 --> 02:17.000
Did the elephant’s trunk evolve? 


02:20.160 --> 02:32.695
Or . . .

00:01 The theme selected  for my comments this month
00:04 is “Punctuality—A Godly Quality.”
00:07 You might remember the opening paragraph
00:10 in a 1990 Watchtower article  on the subject of punctuality.
00:15 It said that an elder’s closest friends
00:18 jokingly called him Armageddon.
00:21 Why?
00:22 They replied: “We know he’s coming,  but only God knows when!”
00:27 The elder had a problem with punctuality.
00:30 Punctuality has nothing  in common with procrastination.
00:35 To procrastinate means
00:37 “to intentionally put off  the doing of something
00:40 that should be done.”
00:43 The saying,  “Tomorrow is the busiest day of the year”
00:47 reflects the human tendency  to procrastinate.
00:51 How appropriate then  is the inspired encouragement
00:54 concerning the present —today.
00:57 Galatians 6:10 says:
00:59 “As long as we have the opportunity,
01:02 let us work what is good toward all.”
01:05 “As long as we have the opportunity”
01:08 does not sound like procrastination to me.
01:11 No, the Bible encourages just the opposite —punctuality.
01:16 Punctuality refers to the characteristic
01:19 of being prompt in keeping appointments.
01:21 Punctuality is a godly quality.
01:24 In fact, Matthew 6:33
01:28 prioritizes our pursuit of Kingdom interests.
01:32 It says:
01:33 “Keep on, then, seeking first  the Kingdom and his righteousness,
01:37 and all these other things  will be added to you.”
01:41 It said to ‘seek the Kingdom first,’
01:45 not second, not third or fourth —first.
01:50 When we put the Kingdom first in our life,
01:53 we do not put it off
01:55 in favor of some trivial pursuit.
01:59 If it is time for a Christian meeting,
02:02 we are there well before it starts.
02:05 Perhaps you have heard some say:
02:09 “At least I made it to the meeting.
02:11 Better late than never!”
02:14 But the godly way is:  “Better never late!”
02:18 Jehovah is a punctual God.
02:20 He sets the example for us.
02:23 When Jehovah decided to destroy  the ungodly world in a deluge,
02:28 he said to Noah at Genesis 6:14:
02:32 “Make for yourself an ark.”
02:35 Then, at Genesis 7:4,
02:37 Jehovah told Noah  to enter into the ark and informed him:
02:41 “For in just seven days,
02:44 I will make it rain on the earth  for 40 days and 40 nights.”
02:49 What happened?
02:51 A “better late than never” attitude?
02:53 No, that is not acceptable to Jehovah.
02:57 Instead, Genesis 7:10 says:
03:00 “And seven days later
03:03 the floodwaters came upon the earth.”
03:06 Right on time.
03:08 Punctuality is a godly quality.
03:11 By means of a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9,
03:15 Jehovah indicated  hundreds of years in advance
03:18 when Jesus would fulfill  his role as Messiah and Savior.
03:22 When did Jesus present  himself for that role?
03:26 “Better late than never?”
03:28 No, precisely on time in 29 C.E.,
03:33 Jesus was anointed as Christ.
03:36 In fact, Romans 5:6 says:
03:39 “Christ died for ungodly men
03:42 at the appointed time.”
03:45 Jehovah is punctual.
03:47 What about in our time?
03:49 The Bible tells us to keep in expectation
03:52 of Jehovah’s future day of judgment.
03:55 When will it happen?
03:57 Well, to us it may seem that it has delayed.
04:02 But what do we know about Jehovah?
04:04 He is punctual.
04:06 And so it is that Habakkuk 2:3 tells us:
04:12 “For the vision  is yet for its appointed time,
04:17 “and it is rushing toward its end,
04:20 “and it will not lie.
04:22 “Even if it should delay,  keep in expectation of it!
04:26 “For it will without fail come true.
04:29 It will not be late!”
04:32 Punctuality is Jehovah’s way.
04:35 Unlike the elder cited earlier,
04:38 this Armageddon will be on time.
04:42 The apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14
04:45 was specifically discussing what happens
04:48 at Christian gatherings.
04:50 In verse 26, he said:
04:52 “When you come together, . . .
04:54 Let all things take place for building up.”
04:58 Then, at 1 Corinthians 14:40,
05:02 he concludes by saying:
05:04 “But let all things take place decently
05:08 and by arrangement.”
05:10 Look at the words again.
05:11 When speaking about Christian meetings,
05:13 he said:  ‘Let things take place decently.’
05:17 In Greek,  it literally means “well-behavedly.”
05:20 Paul also used a Greek word  translated here “by arrangement.”
05:26 The literal meaning of the Greek word  is “according to order.”
05:30 If we are to be well-behaved,  according to order at our meetings,
05:35 what would be one aspect of that?
05:39 Being punctual —on time—
05:41 for the start of the meeting.
05:43 While the lack of punctuality  affects all cultures
05:47 to one degree or another,
05:49 it is true that some cultures
05:51 are more punctual  than others as a whole.
05:54 A missionary reported  that in one town where he served,
05:59 his wife would be  the only person in the audience
06:02 when he announced the opening song  at the beginning of the meeting.
06:07 But when he announced the closing song,
06:10 70 people would be there.
06:13 On the other hand,  in a Western European country,
06:17 about a thousand people were asked:
06:19 “If you were invited  to dinner at 7:00 p.m.,
06:24 “should you arrive  five or ten minutes early,
06:28 or five or ten minutes late,  or exactly on time?”
06:32 The majority responded
06:34 that “courtesy requires  scrupulous respect for the host
06:38 and arriving at the exact minute.”
06:42 Each culture would likely think  that the other is extreme.
06:47 However, being punctual is more  than a matter of regional preference.
06:52 It is a godly quality
06:54 that true Christians of every culture
06:57 want to cultivate.
06:59 Punctuality must become a habit —a way of life.
07:03 It is similar to some countries
07:06 that do not have  a habit of good hygiene, or cleanliness.
07:11 That may be true,  but it is expected that Jehovah’s people
07:15 in those lands will excel  in good hygiene and clean habits.
07:20 In the same way,  no matter what our background,
07:24 culture, or upbringing,
07:26 it is expected  that we as imitators of our God
07:30 will develop  the godly habit of being punctual.
07:35 What helps us to be punctual?
07:38 The Bible encourages advance planning.
07:41 Proverbs 21:5 says:
07:43 “The plans of the diligent  surely lead to success,
07:47 but all who are hasty  surely head for poverty.”
07:52 So being punctual is not just a matter
07:55 of hastily fulfilling  an obligation or an appointment.
07:59 It involves thinking in advance  about our responsibilities.
08:04 Yes, planning to be prepared for them
08:07 and to be prompt in carrying them out.
08:11 Well, what are some activities
08:13 that we would want  to be punctual in fulfilling?
08:18 It can be the everyday things in life,
08:21 such as arriving at work  or at school on time;
08:26 being punctual for appointments,  such as a visit to the doctor or dentist;
08:32 arriving at the designated time  when invited to another’s home for a meal.
08:38 What is our habit like  when it comes to these areas of life?
08:43 Even more important is punctuality
08:46 when attending  our Christian meetings and assemblies.
08:49 This means being present
08:51 before the opening song and prayer.
08:55 The apostle Paul quoted from Psalm 22
08:58 when he wrote Hebrews 2:12.
09:01 Of Jesus he said:
09:04 “I will declare your name to my brothers;
09:07 in the midst of the congregation  I will praise you with song.”
09:11 If that was true of Jesus,
09:14 it is a great incentive  for us to participate
09:18 in singing the first song  with our congregation.
09:23 And the opening prayer  is important for us.
09:26 In ancient times,  Jehovah called the temple
09:30 his “house of prayer.”
09:32 It’s true that the opening prayer
09:34 requests Jehovah’s guidance  and holy spirit on the program,
09:39 however, it also prepares
09:42 our minds and hearts
09:44 to receive the information to be considered.
09:48 Of course, there may be times when one
09:51 is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting.
09:54 Public transportation may be delayed
09:56 or our car may break down.
10:00 That’s understandable on occasion.
10:03 But what is our habit?
10:07 In the past,  it was suggested that we consider
10:10 arriving 15 or 20 minutes  before a meeting started.
10:14 One brother with six siblings
10:17 said his father made a goal  of being at the Kingdom Hall
10:21 20 minutes before the program began.
10:24 That certainly took advance planning.
10:27 His father’s byline  for meeting attendance was:
10:32 “If you’re 5 minutes early,
10:35 then your 15 minutes late.”
10:38 In most cases, the whole family arrived
10:41 20 minutes before the meeting
10:45 for wholesome association.
10:48 Another opportunity for punctuality
10:51 is arriving on time  for a meeting for service.
10:54 This is challenging for some.
10:56 However, with a little advanced planning,
10:59 we can be successful.
11:01 Punctuality is particularly important
11:04 since the actual meeting  is only about ten minutes long.
11:09 If we’re late,  not only is it disruptive
11:13 but it could force  the one taking the lead
11:16 to redo the arrangements  made for the group.
11:21 And speaking of our ministry,
11:23 what is an opportunity  to be punctual every month?
11:27 Yes, you guessed it,
11:29 turning in our field service report  at the end of the month.
11:33 Do you have a way  of reminding yourself of this?
11:38 In some lands,  it is almost as if it is a custom
11:41 for the start  of a wedding talk to be delayed.
11:45 Often this is because  of mistakenly gauging how much time
11:50 the bride needs  to get dressed and made up
11:53 for her grand appearance.
11:56 However,  being considerate of those invited
12:00 should move those involved  to allow extra time
12:04 to complete the task of preparation.
12:07 A 1990 Watchtower  commented on being punctual
12:12 in starting a wedding.
12:14 The very next sentence stated:
12:17 “You may like to have your egg boiled
12:21 for just so many minutes.”
12:24 I am not sure exactly how  that applies to a wedding,
12:28 but I think we get the point,  don’t we?
12:32 We should have calculated  the timing in advance
12:37 so that the ceremony begins on time.
12:42 Do we have yet another example  of being punctual,
12:46 not procrastinating?
12:48 How about when there is a difference
12:51 between you and a fellow believer
12:54 or a family member?
12:56 Of course, if it is simply a minor issue
13:01 because of imperfection,
13:03 often the best thing to do  is forgive and forget.
13:08 But if it was more serious
13:11 or we cannot simply let it go,
13:15 what should we do?
13:17 We need to settle the matter  and restore the peace.
13:21 When should we take this step?
13:23 Do not procrastinate.
13:26 If we do,  the problem may fester and get worse.
13:31 What kind of a priority  did Jesus establish
13:34 for restoring peace  between fellow believers?
13:38 At Matthew 5:23, 24,
13:42 note his clear indication of punctuality:
13:46 “If, then, you are bringing  your gift to the altar
13:50 “and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
13:54 “leave your gift there in front  of the altar, and go away.
13:58 “First make your peace with your brother,
14:01 and then come back and offer your gift.”
14:03 Did you pick up on the timing
14:06 that Jesus recommended for reconciliation?
14:10 He said:
14:12 “[First] First make your peace  with your brother.”
14:17 It is a high priority  and should be treated as such.
14:22 But remember  the scripture we shared earlier,
14:25 Proverbs 21:5?
14:27 This principle should be implemented.
14:31 The last part of the verse
14:34 warns us not to be “hasty.”
14:37 Hasty is not synonymous with punctuality.
14:41 Instead,  the first part of the verse indicates
14:45 we should prepare or plan the visit first.
14:50 Then follow through without procrastinating.
14:53 It said this approach will “lead to success.”
14:59 What is the success we are seeking?
15:03 Jesus did not say to justify our position
15:07 or to point out the flaw
15:10 in the other person’s words or actions.
15:13 No, he said you would be successful
15:16 if you  “make your peace with your brother.”
15:21 Punctuality is a godly quality
15:24 that we should strive to cultivate.
15:27 Another aspect of punctuality
15:30 is ending an assignment on time.
15:33 In the interest of punctuality,
15:35 let’s move on  to the next segment of our program.

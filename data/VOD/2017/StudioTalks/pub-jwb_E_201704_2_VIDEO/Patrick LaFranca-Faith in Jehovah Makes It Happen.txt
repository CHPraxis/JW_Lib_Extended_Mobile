00:02 During his earthly ministry,
00:04 Jesus miraculously healed
00:06 many sick or disabled persons.
00:08 At times,  he would say to such ones
00:11 the expression we find  at Matthew 9:29:
00:15 “According to your faith  let it happen to you.”
00:20 The principle of what Jesus stated
00:22 applies in every aspect  of our Christian life and ministry.
00:27 But today we will discuss how this principle
00:30 that faith in Jehovah makes things happen
00:33 can work for us in three areas.
00:35 We will see:
00:37 1) how our faith has made positive things  happen in our personal life,
00:42 2) how we can accomplish  things in God’s service
00:46 that would not be possible  without faith in Jehovah God,
00:51 and 3) how faith moves us  to step out of our comfort zone
00:56 to do more in Jehovah’s service.
00:59 The principle that faith in Jehovah  makes things happen
01:03 is well illustrated in one  of the miracles Jesus performed.
01:07 Please open your Bible to Mark chapter 5,
01:12 and let’s read verses 25-29:
01:16 “Now there was a woman
01:18 “who had had  a flow of blood for 12 years.
01:21 “She had suffered much  at the hands of many physicians
01:25 “and had spent all her resources,
01:28 “and she was no better but,  rather, had become worse.
01:31 “When she heard  the reports about Jesus,
01:35 “she came up behind him in the crowd  and touched his outer garment,
01:40 “for she kept saying:
01:42 “‘If I touch just his outer garments,  I will get well.’
01:47 “And immediately her flow  of blood dried up,
01:51 “and she sensed in her body
01:54 that she had been healed  of the grievous sickness.”
01:58 In the following verses,  Jesus asked who had touched him.
02:02 The woman then revealed  before the crowd
02:04 what she had done  and how she’d been cured.
02:07 Now notice Jesus’ response in verse 34:
02:12 “He said to her:
02:15 “‘Daughter,  your faith has made you well.
02:18 “‘Go in peace, and be healed
02:21 from your grievous sickness.’”
02:23 What comforting words
02:25 Jesus spoke to this trembling woman:
02:27 “Your faith has made you well.”
02:30 What did Jesus mean?
02:32 Let’s examine the account more closely.
02:36 It says that the woman  heard “reports about Jesus.”
02:40 Many others heard the same reports,
02:42 but not all put faith in Jesus.
02:45 And think of the circumstances
02:47 that could have prevented her  from even coming to Jesus.
02:51 She had been disappointed many times
02:53 over the past 12 years.
02:55 She might well have thought:
02:57 ‘What’s the use?
02:59 ‘I’m tired and weak and poor.
03:03 I’m staying home.’
03:05 Or ‘I would like for Jesus to see me,
03:07 ‘but there is such a crowd.
03:09 ‘How will I ever get through to him?
03:12 ‘And after all,  I’m in an unclean state,
03:15 ‘and if the people discover this,
03:18 perhaps they will punish me.’
03:20 No, she did not allow  these negative thoughts
03:23 or doubts to fill her mind.
03:25 She left her home.
03:27 She found Jesus  despite the large crowd.
03:31 And what was she saying?
03:33 Did she say,
03:35 “If I touch just his outer garments,
03:37 maybe I will get well”?
03:40 No, she said,
03:42 “I will get well.”
03:44 Now, it was not the case
03:46 that her faith healed her.
03:48 No, but her faith moved her  to come to Jesus,
03:53 and she was healed  by the power from Jehovah
03:55 that flowed through his Son.
03:58 Faith to approach Jesus
04:00 made it happen for her.
04:03 If you are a dedicated,  baptized Christian,
04:07 don’t you agree  that your faith has already made
04:10 positive things happen  in your personal life?
04:13 No, you were not miraculously healed
04:16 of your physical sicknesses.
04:18 We look forward  to physical healing of our ills
04:20 during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.
04:23 But today Jesus Christ directs a program
04:27 of spiritual healing.
04:29 When we were a part  of this godless world,
04:32 many of us were sick spiritually,  morally, and emotionally.
04:36 No one could cure us.
04:38 Perhaps we desperately  tried material things or pleasures
04:43 to fill our spiritual need,
04:45 but our condition only got worse.
04:48 We were helpless and hopeless.
04:51 But then we heard “reports”
04:54 —the good news  of God’s Kingdom under Christ!
04:58 We studied the Bible.
05:00 Our faith moved us  to make positive changes in our life
05:04 and to associate  with the Christian congregation.
05:07 Today, we enjoy  good spiritual health and happiness.
05:12 Our faith has made it happen.
05:17 Faith has also made it possible
05:19 to accomplish things in God’s service
05:22 that perhaps  we never thought we could do.
05:25 Please open your Bibles  to Hebrews chapter 11.
05:30 In this portion  of Paul’s letter to the Hebrews,
05:33 he focuses on faith.
05:35 He begins with a definition of faith.
05:39 But then, starting in verse 4,
05:41 Paul acts as a sort of tour guide,
05:45 walking us through the corridor
05:47 of thousands of years of Bible history.
05:49 He stops along the way
05:52 to point out the extraordinary things
05:54 that men and women of the past did
05:57 by means of faith in Jehovah God.
06:00 Just glance down the columns  in this chapter
06:05 and notice how Paul introduces  each paragraph
06:08 with the words “by faith.”
06:12 This expression “by faith”
06:15 appears 18 times in this one chapter.
06:20 Now, when we look at the names
06:22 Paul lists in this chapter,
06:24 we may think,
06:26 ‘Well, these were spiritual “giants.”’
06:30 But in reality,  they were ordinary humans
06:33 with weaknesses  like all of us have today.
06:37 The thing they all had in common
06:39 was faith,
06:41 and faith in Jehovah
06:44 made it possible  for them to do amazing things.
06:47 Let’s look at some of them  and compare what they did
06:51 with what many of you  are doing today
06:54 by faith.
06:56 Let’s read verse 5:
06:58 “By faith Enoch was transferred
07:02 “so as not to see death,
07:04 “and he was nowhere to be found
07:06 “because God had transferred him;
07:09 “for before he was transferred
07:11 “he received the witness
07:13 that he had pleased God well.”
07:16 The book of Jude, verses 14 and 15,
07:19 informs us that Enoch boldly proclaimed
07:22 that Jehovah was going to destroy
07:24 that ungodly world.
07:27 It appears that wicked, violent men
07:30 were going to take Enoch’s life
07:32 because of his bold witness.
07:34 So God chose to take him
07:36 —that is, gently cutting short his life,
07:39 sparing him the pangs of a violent death.
07:44 In modern times, like Enoch,
07:46 many brothers and sisters
07:48 have boldly declared God’s judgments
07:51 even when faced with death.
07:54 One brother,  after receiving a death sentence
07:57 at Nazi hands during World War II,
07:59 wrote these words  shortly before his execution:
08:03 “I have such peace, such tranquillity,
08:08 that you can’t possibly imagine!”
08:12 Faith made such boldness
08:14 and calmness possible.
08:16 In many ways, you very likely
08:19 have shown the same faith as Enoch.
08:23 By faith,  you stand up to an ungodly world
08:27 by not adopting its corrupt ways.
08:30 By faith,  you boldly declare God’s Word
08:33 from house to house  and in public places.
08:36 Before you became a baptized Witness,
08:39 you may have thought you would never do  this preaching work!
08:43 But you are doing it,
08:45 sometimes even in the face
08:47 of verbal abuse and opposition.
08:49 Faith has made it happen.
08:52 Let’s read verse 7:
08:55 “By faith Noah,
08:57 “after receiving divine warning  of things not yet seen,
09:01 “showed godly fear  and constructed an ark
09:04 “for the saving of his household;
09:07 “and through this faith  he condemned the world,
09:10 “and he became an heir  of the righteousness
09:12 that results from faith.”
09:14 Nothing in the Bible indicates
09:17 that Jehovah chose Noah  to construct an ark
09:20 because he was an experienced builder.
09:23 Certainly, he never had built  such a gigantic vessel
09:27 as what Jehovah  had asked him to construct.
09:30 Noah likely pondered many questions:
09:34 ‘How will I get all the building materials?
09:37 ‘Do I have the right tools to do the job?
09:40 ‘How will I gather all the animals?
09:43 ‘What food will they need, and how much?
09:46 ‘When, exactly, will the Deluge begin?
09:49 ‘How long will it last?
09:52 Where will the ark land  after the Flood subsides?’
09:55 Nothing in the record indicates
09:58 that Jehovah gave Noah  all the details in advance.
10:01 What Noah did have was faith.
10:05 Faith moved him to begin building.
10:08 His faith saved him and his family.
10:11 Faith in Jehovah made it happen.
10:15 Like Noah, during this time of the end,
10:19 Jehovah’s people have taken on
10:21 challenging theocratic building projects.
10:24 Certainly, constructing  the new world headquarters
10:27 at Warwick, New York,
10:29 was one of these projects  that required much faith.
10:32 A committee of brothers was assigned
10:34 to complete this vast project
10:37 in less than four years.
10:39 To do so, they knew they had to begin
10:42 by July 2013.
10:45 They moved ahead in faith.
10:47 Though the town  had not yet approved the site permits,
10:51 they began inviting workers to the site
10:54 with that date in mind.
10:57 Time was passing quickly.
10:59 The invited volunteers  were buying plane tickets.
11:02 Bethel was arranging rooming  and other details.
11:06 Yet, the committee  still did not have site permits.
11:10 Would they cancel these invitations?
11:12 They state:
11:15 “We spent a lot of time praying about it.
11:18 “We decided we needed to act in faith.
11:21 “And we were just convinced
11:24 Jehovah was going to make it happen.”
11:26 As the deadline approached,
11:29 the brothers had done everything possible
11:32 to obtain the permits.
11:34 The town planning board  was holding a public hearing.
11:38 And to the brothers’ great surprise,
11:40 within 15 minutes  of the start of the meeting,
11:43 the town board voted  to approve the project.
11:47 These overseers commented,
11:50 “When the approval came through,
11:53 “we knew it was  only by Jehovah’s spirit
11:56 that that happened.”
11:58 True, but it was  also the brothers’ faith
12:01 to act that made it happen.
12:04 Those experiences  are found in the video
12:07 World Headquarters —History Is Being Written.
12:11 You can find it  in the “Our Activities” section
12:15 under the “Construction” category.
12:19 Now let’s read Hebrews 11:8:
12:23 “By faith Abraham, when he was called,
12:27 “obeyed by going out to a place
12:29 “he was to receive as an inheritance;
12:32 “he went out, although not knowing
12:34 where he was going.”
12:36 What faith it took
12:38 for Abraham  and his submissive wife, Sarah,
12:41 to leave the prosperous city of Ur
12:44 and to go wherever  Jehovah would lead them!
12:47 It meant leaving the security  of a pleasant home
12:51 and moving to some strange  and potentially hostile land
12:55 some 1,000 miles,  or 1,609 kilometers,  away.
13:01 Do we see such faith today?
13:03 Absolutely!
13:05 Since 2014,
13:07 thousands of brothers and sisters
13:09 have attended the School  for Kingdom Evangelizers,
13:12 agreeing to be assigned  to wherever
13:15 there is a need  by the organization.
13:18 Faith has made it happen.
13:22 When a call goes out  for skilled volunteers
13:24 to help build  or expand branch facilities,
13:28 faith moves brothers and sisters  to simplify their lives
13:32 and to leave their comfort zone  in order to assist.
13:36 For example, in 2009,
13:40 the congregations  in the United States were informed
13:43 that an expansion project  at Wallkill, New York,
13:46 was being planned.
13:49 One couple moved out  of their newly built
13:52 2,200-square-foot,  or 200-square-meter, dream home
13:57 and into a 270-square-foot,  or 25-square-meter, apartment
14:02 so that they could make  themselves available.
14:05 What happened?
14:07 They explain:
14:08 “One month after we moved  into our small apartment,
14:12 “we received an invitation to serve
14:14 “as temporary volunteers at Wallkill.
14:18 “It was clear to us  that by simplifying our life,
14:22 we had given Jehovah  something to bless.”
14:25 Faith made it happen for them.
14:29 So, what have we learned today?
14:33 Faith in Jehovah God  is a powerful motivating force
14:37 that impels us to act  in harmony with his will.
14:41 Jehovah rewards such faith.
14:44 Remember, the very meaning  of the name of our God, Jehovah,
14:48 is “He Causes to Become.”
14:51 Truly, he is a God  who makes things happen!
14:56 Brothers and sisters,  let us continue to act in faith.
15:00 Jehovah will continue  to make wonderful things
15:03 happen in our personal life.
15:06 We will accomplish things  we never could do
15:09 through our own personal efforts.
15:11 We will be able to do more  in Jehovah’s service.
15:14 May it happen to you  “according to your faith.”

00:01 The theme for our program this month is
00:04 “Treasure Jehovah’s Reminders.”
00:07 And it’s based on Psalm 19:7,
00:12 where we’re told:
00:14 “The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,
00:18 making the inexperienced one wise.”
00:22 In the original language,  the word here translated as “reminder”
00:27 comes from a root word meaning  “to go over again, to repeat.”
00:32 Reminders have always been  an essential part of Jehovah’s teaching.
00:37 In ancient Israel,  God’s people continually received
00:40 commandments,  regulations, and reminders.
00:45 In fact, Jehovah tells us
00:47 that he sent  his prophets “again and again”
00:50 to repeatedly remind his people  of their responsibilities.
00:55 The apostle Peter  felt the need to give reminders
00:58 even to those  who were “well-established in the truth.”
01:02 Notice how he describes this
01:04 at 2 Peter 1:12, 13:
01:08 “For this reason I intend always
01:12 “to remind you of these things,
01:14 “although you know them  and are well-established
01:16 “in the truth that is present in you.
01:19 “But I consider it right,
01:21 “as long as I am in this tabernacle,
01:23 to stir you with reminders.”
01:27 In verse 15,  he goes on to give the reason
01:30 why he felt the need  to give the brothers reminders.
01:33 He says:
01:35 “I will always do my utmost  so that after my departure,
01:40 you may be able to recall  these things for yourselves.”
01:45 So Peter was determined  to help the brothers and sisters
01:47 in his day to remember, or recall,
01:51 the teachings they had already learned.
01:54 It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then,
01:56 if today a lot of our teaching  involves reminders.
02:00 It follows the pattern set  by Jehovah in ancient Israel
02:04 and with the first-century Christians.
02:07 But why do we need reminders?
02:10 Let’s consider three reasons.
02:13 First, let’s look at Psalm 103:2.
02:17 There it says:
02:19 “Let me praise Jehovah;
02:22 may I never forget all that he has done.”
02:25 Why, then, do we need reminders?
02:28 Simply put, because we forget.
02:31 If we had perfect memories,
02:33 we wouldn’t need so many reminders.
02:35 Even in everyday life,  many of us use little notes
02:39 to remind ourselves  of what we need to do.
02:41 And who of us  hasn’t seen the need
02:44 for a list of reminders  when going shopping,
02:47 only to realize when we returned
02:50 that we forgot to get one  of the important items
02:52 we needed to purchase?
02:54 If reminders are important  in everyday life,
02:57 how much more so in matters
02:59 that involve our relationship  with Jehovah.
03:03 Let’s read Luke 10:39, 40.
03:09 Speaking of Martha, we are told:
03:11 “She also had a sister called Mary,
03:14 “who sat down at the feet of the Lord
03:16 “and kept listening to what he was saying.
03:19 “Martha, on the other hand,
03:21 was distracted with attending to many duties.”
03:26 What was Martha’s problem?
03:28 She was distracted.
03:30 So the second reason  why we need reminders
03:33 is that, like Martha,  at times we too become distracted.
03:38 Although we may already know  a vital fact,
03:41 that fact might get put  into the back of our mind,
03:44 figuratively speaking,
03:45 because other matters  are demanding our attention.
03:49 Satan is the great Distracter.
03:52 He tries to turn our attention away  from the true issues of our day.
03:57 People in general have become  more and more distracted
04:00 by entertainment  and other nonessential matters.
04:05 No wonder that Satan  has succeeded in misleading so many.
04:09 They don’t even realize  what has happened.
04:13 Reason number three  is alluded to
04:16 at Matthew 24:45:
04:20 “Who really  is the faithful and discreet slave
04:23 “whom his master appointed  over his domestics,
04:26 to give them their food  at the proper time?”
04:30 Notice that the spiritual food  is given to us “at the proper time.”
04:35 Our circumstances in life  are continually changing.
04:39 How often do we hear,
04:41 “That was just what I needed?”
04:43 We’ve all experienced that,  haven’t we?
04:46 So, what are three of the reasons  why we need reminders?
04:50 One,  because we tend to forget things.
04:53 Two,  we often become distracted.
04:57 Three,  our changed circumstances
05:00 may require a reminder  of something we already knew
05:04 but didn’t fully need at that time.
05:07 So that brings us to the next question:
05:10 What will help us to remember?
05:13 It’s interesting to note  that Jehovah has used many ways
05:17 to remind his people  of what they should do.
05:20 At Numbers 10:10, we’re told
05:24 that the various festivals  were given as reminders,
05:27 especially the celebration  of the Passover.
05:31 That means  that every time the Israelites
05:34 prepared and celebrated  one of these festivals,
05:37 they were reminded  of important matters,
05:39 such as how Jehovah  provides for his people
05:43 and how he has saved them  in the past.
05:46 Something similar happens today
05:48 at the commemoration  of the Lord’s Evening Meal.
05:51 Not only do we hear  the reminders from God’s Word
05:55 but the act of passing  the bread and wine
05:58 also serves as an action that reminds us
06:01 of what Jesus did in our behalf.
06:05 But what do we need to do in order for those reminders
06:08 to have a beneficial impact  on our lives?
06:12 Notice what Psalm 119:99 says.
06:17 It tells us:
06:18 “I have more insight than all my teachers,
06:22 because I ponder over your reminders.”
06:26 Yes, we need to ponder  over these reminders.
06:29 That means not just  listening to or reading them,
06:33 but it involves thinking deeply  about them—
06:36 meditating on their value.
06:38 Just to listen or read  without meditating
06:42 is like looking through the lens  of a movie camera
06:45 without pressing the record button.
06:47 We see things and hear things,
06:50 but nothing is recorded.
06:53 So we need  to meditate, visualize,
06:56 and review these reminders.
06:59 This will help us  to remember what we learn.
07:02 But, figuratively speaking,  there is something else
07:06 that we can do  to press the record button.
07:09 That means we don’t have to wait
07:11 for someone else  to give us a reminder.
07:14 We can make our own reminder.
07:16 How can we do so?
07:19 The answer to that question
07:21 is highlighted  in Jehovah’s instructions to Moses
07:25 as found at Exodus 17:14:
07:28 “Jehovah now said to Moses:
07:31 “‘Write this as a memorial
07:34 “‘[or the footnote says: “reminder”]
07:36 in the book and repeat it to Joshua.’”
07:39 What’s the point?
07:41 Write down new things  we want to remember.
07:45 Some brothers use a notebook,  or exercise book,
07:48 to write down a list of interesting points  that they want to remember.
07:52 Then they look through the book  from time to time
07:55 to remind themselves of those points.
07:58 Many of us do this with our notes  from conventions and assemblies.
08:03 Of course, to do that successfully,
08:06 you need to remember  where you put the notebook.
08:08 Additionally,  we have to be careful
08:11 that we don’t write down  every little fact.
08:14 Otherwise, we may become overwhelmed  with all the information.
08:19 We can make  these notes either on paper
08:22 or electronically using computers  or electronic devices.
08:27 Whatever system we use,  let’s make lists of things
08:31 that we want to remember.
08:34 Many brothers have found it good  to have two separate lists.
08:38 One list could be subjects
08:41 —perhaps points that we want to use
08:43 in the ministry or in our own lives.
08:46 Another, scriptures
08:48 —explanations that clarify  the meaning of certain verses.
08:53 With regard to notes on scriptures,
08:56 let’s ask a very important question:
08:59 Do you have a study Bible?
09:03 What is a study Bible?
09:05 Perhaps it’s a separate Bible
09:07 to the one you take in the ministry.
09:10 It’s a Bible for you to write in
09:12 so that you’re reminded  of things that you’ve learned.
09:16 These are some of the things  we can do with a study Bible:
09:20 Highlight or underline some words or verses.
09:24 That will make it easier to find them again.
09:27 But remember not to make  too many highlights or marks;
09:31 otherwise, nothing will stand out.
09:34 Write a summary of points and scriptures  you want to remember
09:37 on the blank pages in the front  or the back of your Bible.
09:42 Write notes in the margin
09:44 —that’s what Gilead students often do.
09:47 Of course, you need  the right type of pen or pencil
09:50 that won’t bleed through  to the other side of the page.
09:54 What type of things  could you write in the margin?
09:57 Perhaps new points  that you learn while reading magazines
10:01 or attending meetings and assemblies.
10:04 If you learn a new point, ask yourself,
10:07 ‘What verse is being explained?’
10:10 And then write a brief comment  in the margin next to that verse.
10:14 Let’s take an example.
10:16 Perhaps you are reading  the Sermon on the Mount
10:19 and you get to Matthew 7:24-27.
10:24 That’s the illustration
10:26 about the two men who built houses
10:28 —one on sand and the other on rock.
10:31 As you research this  in Watchtower Library
10:34 or the Research Guide,
10:36 you come across the article
10:38 “Are You Building on Sand or on Rock?”
10:41 in the November 1, 2008, Watchtower.
10:46 What points could you write in the margin
10:48 to help you remember the explanation?
10:50 Well, perhaps you could write:
10:52 Sand equals build on the surface.
10:57 Rock equals dig down deep.
11:02 Digging equals doing and applying.
11:06 You might even put Luke 6:46-48 there.
11:10 Now, if you still have room  and your writing is small,
11:14 you could add something like this:
11:16 Not hearers only, but doers.
11:20 Both houses in same location,
11:23 same tests, foundations different.
11:28 Now every time  you read those verses,
11:30 you will be reminded  of what they mean.
11:34 Perhaps like me,
11:36 you’ve had several study Bibles  over the years.
11:39 I think back to the first one I used.
11:41 It was like this big green Bible.
11:44 Then, later that was replaced  by another Bible
11:48 —this black covered Bible.
11:50 And then, further still,
11:52 we had another Bible —the Reference Bible.
11:56 And, of course,  now for most of us,
11:59 we have the large-print Bible.
12:02 This does, however,
12:04 highlight a challenge  we might experience.
12:07 It can be frustrating
12:09 when a new edition  of the Bible comes out.
12:11 How do you transfer all your study notes
12:13 over to the new Bible?
12:16 Additionally, our beloved study Bible  may wear out
12:20 or, worse still, be lost, stolen, burned,  ruined, run over, blown away.
12:27 So that’s the advantage  of using an electronic list;
12:31 it doesn’t matter  what type of file you use.
12:34 It can be updated very easily,  and you can even make copies
12:39 —not like the printed copy
12:41 that already has  the old idea written in the margin.
12:45 Even now in English,
12:47 we have the books  of Matthew, Mark, and Luke
12:50 in our electronic study Bible
12:52 on jw.org and WOL.
12:56 Later in the program,  we have some exciting news
13:00 about how JW Library  will help us in this regard.
13:03 But I’ll leave that for later.
13:06 Really, having a study Bible  is not only helpful
13:11 but it also makes our personal study  far more interesting.
13:15 How so?
13:17 Every time we read  or study a publication,
13:20 we’ll find ourselves  searching for new points
13:23 that we can write  in our study Bible.
13:27 This way, we’ll be doing  what the psalmist expressed
13:30 at Psalm 119:111:
13:34 ‘We will take Jehovah’s reminders
13:36 ‘as our permanent possession  (or heritage),
13:39 for his reminders  are the joy of our hearts!’

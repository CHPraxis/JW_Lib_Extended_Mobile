00:01 My theme for this month’s broadcast is
00:06 “Young Ones —Build Your Future With Jehovah!”
00:12 If you do,
1 Timothy 6:19 assures
00:17 that you will  ‘safely treasure up for yourself
00:20 a fine foundation for the future,’
00:23 and you will  “get a firm hold on the real life.”
00:29 Obviously, we will be directing  many of our comments
00:34 directly to you dear young ones
00:37 in Jehovah’s organization.
00:40 Yet, if we think about it,
00:42 all of us figuratively
00:44 are very young ones
00:46 compared to eternity
00:49 —how long we hope to live.
00:52 So, in a sense,  our comments during this broadcast
00:56 have application to all of us.
01:00 Personally, I am so thankful to Jehovah
01:05 that positive peer pressure  was put on me
01:08 to enter the pioneer ministry  right out of high school.
01:13 What a blessing and a protection
01:16 it was to enter  the regular pioneer work
01:20 at age 17
01:22 and to be able to go to Bethel at 18.
01:26 Even though there was considerable  worldly pressure put on me
01:31 to pursue university education,
01:34 I am so happy that with Jehovah’s help,
01:38 I decided to build my future
01:42 with Jehovah.
01:44 Truly, I have no regrets.
01:48 And this is always true of young ones
01:52 who serve Jehovah from their hearts
01:55 —they have no regrets.
01:58 In fact, you will enjoy  these expressions from young ones
02:03 who are building  their future with Jehovah.
02:11 Before I started pioneering,
02:13 I was really nervous that I wouldn’t be able  to get my time in every month.
02:17 It was a bit hard when I started pioneering  because I didn’t have a car.
02:21 My boss,  he didn’t give me part-time work.
02:24 I found it really hard  to balance schoolwork
02:26 and pioneering  at the same time.
02:28 My biggest struggle was fear of man,  so that really hindered me
02:32 because I wasn’t very good  at talking to people.
02:34 Having a good routine was a struggle.
02:37 My brother and I are  the only ones in the truth.
02:41 My family didn’t understand
02:43 why we wanted to go preaching.
02:46 I didn’t think  that I’d make a good pioneer.
02:48 I’ve had Type 1 diabetes  since I was five.
02:51 So I was always worried  about whether or not
02:54 I could balance that health condition  with pioneering.
02:57 The challenges  don’t seem that big now,
03:00 but back at that time  they were a really big deal.
03:03 But the coolest thing  was how Jehovah helped me.
03:05 Prayer to Jehovah  helped me overcome my fears.
03:08 My family was  a massive help from Jehovah.
03:12 Because my dad was the one  who first encouraged me to pioneer,
03:14 when I did start pioneering,  he promised that I would have
03:18 the full support of my family.
03:20 When I spoke to brothers and sisters  who spent their youth
03:24 in the full-time service  that really helped me
03:26 because it was really encouraging,  and it really motivated me
03:30 to want to make my own memories  and my own experiences
03:32 in the full-time service.
03:34 So there were  practical things I could do.
03:36 I didn’t have a car;  I just walked or I caught the bus.
03:40 I had to work out  what my priorities were first.
03:42 So I had to find out how many hours  would I have to go witnessing every week.
03:46 So then I just sat down  and I looked at every day
03:49 and planned out which days  I could go witnessing,
03:51 which days I had to go to school,
03:53 and also allocated time  so that I could do my homework and study.
03:56 Having a schedule  was really good
03:58 because I could see it  all out in front of me,
04:00 and I could see  that the hour requirement
04:02 was actually attainable,  so that made it a lot less daunting.
04:04 I first set short-term goals of pioneering  in the special months of activity.
04:09 Then I was able  to begin continuous auxiliary,
04:12 and then eventually  I started regular pioneering.
04:15 One of the best things I did  to prepare myself for pioneering
04:18 was to auxiliary pioneer beforehand.
04:20 It really set me up  to be able to overcome
04:23 any challenges  that I faced while I was pioneering.
04:26 I thought about Malachi 3:10.
04:29 I knew I trusted in Jehovah,
04:31 but this was my chance  to test him out.
04:33 I prayed,  put my trust in Jehovah,
04:36 and put my application in.
04:38 After my form  was in for pioneering,
04:40 a brother, with time,  a brother called me and offered me work.
04:44 I had unemployment  for three months,
04:47 which wasn’t a good time.
04:50 But during that time,  I had Jehovah as my main focus.
04:53 And so he supported me,  and he didn’t let me down.
04:57 Asking brothers and sisters to come
04:59 and work with me,  maybe on days that I knew
05:01 that I wouldn’t get as much support,  really helped.
05:03 That helped me to organize  my hours a little bit more,
05:06 and also I’d get to know  my brothers and sisters more as well.
05:09 One of the greatest joys of pioneering  has been to pioneer with Mum.
05:13 And we had the privilege of going
05:16 to the pioneer school together,  which was really special.
05:18 Psalm 16:8 reminds me
05:21 that Jehovah is right beside me.
05:25 When I’m preaching,  it’s like Jehovah is holding my hand.
05:29 So with full-time service,  I love making Jehovah happy.
05:33 With everything that he has given me,  I’m finally able to give something back.
05:37 Looking back —pioneering—
05:38 it was the best decision  I’ve ever made.
05:40 It’s opened up  so many different avenues
05:42 of service to Jehovah,
05:44 and it helped me also  to have that real desire
05:46 to want to stay  in full-time service.
05:49 Helping someone  on the road to everlasting life,
05:52 it’s the best feeling ever;  and it’s really irreplaceable.
05:58 The only thing I can say,
06:01 “As a young person, start pioneering!”
06:07 What a fine attitude  those young ones have!
06:12 They are clearly following  in Jesus’ footsteps.
06:17 Jesus was the wisest man
06:21 who ever walked the earth.
06:23 He could’ve pursued any career
06:26 and truly excelled at it.
06:29 He could’ve been  the greatest carpenter who ever lived.
06:34 Think about it,
06:36 he helped his Father  build the physical universe.
06:39 Can you imagine  what kind of houses he could’ve built?
06:44 Or what if he had pursued  being an inventor?
06:48 With his perfect brain,
06:51 he probably could’ve invented  the telephone,
06:55 automobile, or computer
06:57 in the first century.
06:59 Or what about becoming  a businessman?
07:02 With perfect intelligence,
07:05 he likely could’ve come out on top
07:08 of every business transaction  that he entered,
07:12 becoming the richest businessman  who ever lived.
07:18 Or have you ever thought about
07:20 if he had pursued becoming  an athlete?
07:24 And excelling in athletic contests
07:27 was a huge endeavor in Jesus’ day.
07:31 With a little training,
07:33 it is likely that his perfect body
07:36 would have outperformed all people
07:39 with imperfect bodies,
07:41 enabling him to become
07:44 the most famous athlete who ever lived.
07:48 Or one more example,
07:50 what if he had decided to become a doctor?
07:53 He could cure sick people
07:56 —even raise the dead.
08:00 Can you imagine how much  he could’ve charged rich people
08:04 to raise their dead loved ones?
08:07 But Jesus pursued none of these careers.
08:11 Why?
08:13 Because he knew  that any of such endeavors
08:17 would have only very limited
08:20 and temporary benefits.
08:23 Instead, he pursued something
08:26 he knew would bring far-reaching  and everlasting benefits:
08:31 the full-time ministry.
08:35 If this is how the wisest man  who ever walked the earth—
08:39 If this is how he reasoned,
08:41 we are wise if we strive to think  the same way.
08:47 That makes me think of the comments
08:50 of a well-adjusted teenage brother
08:53 whom we served  while in the circuit work many years ago.
08:57 This young brother went straight into  the regular pioneer work
09:02 out of high school,
09:04 and I asked him why he did so.
09:07 He explained that he knew
09:10 he could’ve gotten a full-time secular job
09:13 and bought a new car for himself,
09:16 but he reasoned that in a few years
09:21 that car would rust out and break down,
09:26 and he would have nothing.
09:28 But he knew that he could go  into the pioneer work
09:32 and build a close relationship with Jehovah
09:35 and perhaps even find  an honest-hearted person
09:39 and be able to teach that one the truth.
09:42 And he knew that would last forever.
09:47 Now, that is some wise thinking
09:49 on the part of that young brother.
09:52 And today, that brother  has a beautiful Christian wife
09:57 and several spiritual children,
09:59 and he is serving as a fine elder.
10:04 But if you young ones  are going to think this way
10:08 and continue to pursue spiritual goals,
10:11 it is vital that you wisely choose
10:16 your associates.
10:18 In a sense, our associates
10:21 can be likened to an elevator.
10:25 What do we mean?
10:27 Well, they can take you up
10:30 or they can take you down.
10:32 If you choose wisely,
10:35 they will take you up
10:37 —elevate your good qualities
10:40 and make you a better person.
10:42 But if you choose poorly,
10:44 they will take you down.
10:47 Depending on how badly you choose,
10:50 they can take you way down
10:53 —to the basement,
10:55 even the subbasement.
10:59 At Proverbs 13:20,
11:02 our loving heavenly Father,
11:05 who made us,  explains how it works.
11:08 Jehovah tells us there:
11:11 “The one walking with the wise
11:14 “will become wise,
11:17 “but the one  who has dealings with the stupid
11:21 will fare badly.”
11:25 “Walking with”
11:27 and “having dealings with”
11:29 mean “associating with.”
11:31 And who are the “stupid” ones?
11:35 Well, this scripture contrasts  such a person
11:38 with those who are wise.
11:40 It is not talking about someone  who lacks mental intellect.
11:44 It is talking about someone
11:47 who does not make  wise decisions spiritually
11:51 from Jehovah’s standpoint.
11:53 And if we think about it,
11:55 anyone who is not really serving Jehovah
11:59 —at least right now—
12:01 that one is unwise indeed.
12:06 And if we associate closely with such ones,
12:10 Jehovah says that we “will fare badly.”
12:15 We could use another illustration.
12:18 Think about someone who is physically sick
12:21 and is running a high fever.
12:24 If we spend a lot of time with that person,
12:28 we will probably catch the same sickness.
12:32 Or worse,
12:34 if we spend a lot of time  near a dead body—a corpse—
12:38 we will probably pick up a disease.
12:42 Well, it is similar
12:44 with spending time with a person
12:47 who is spiritually sick,
12:49 or worse, spiritually dead.
12:53 On the other hand,
12:56 if we choose as our associates
12:59 those who love Jehovah
13:01 and who are building  their everlasting future with Jehovah,
13:06 we will benefit greatly.
13:10 Please observe carefully  this variety of young ones
13:15 who are busy storing up  treasures in heaven
13:20 with Jehovah.
15:16 How heartwarming it is to us
15:20 —and we know it is to Jehovah—
15:23 to see these beautiful young people
15:26 doing what Jesus encourages
15:29 at Matthew 6:20, 21.
15:34 There, Jesus encourages:
15:37 “Store up for yourselves  treasures in heaven,
15:42 “where neither moth nor rust consumes,
15:46 “and where thieves do not break in and steal.
15:51 “For where your treasure is,
15:53 there your heart will be also.”
15:58 And if we think about it,
16:00 in the final analysis,
16:03 after all is said and done,
16:05 whether we are younger or older,
16:07 our net worth will be
16:11 what we have stored up  in heaven with Jehovah.
16:14 We will not be able to take  material treasures with us
16:18 through the great tribulation.
16:21 And if we die,
16:23 we certainly will not be able to take  material treasures with us,
16:27 but we can take spiritual treasures
16:30 with us through the great tribulation
16:33 and even through death and resurrection.
16:37 It is true with all of Jehovah’s people,
16:41 as it is with the anointed,
16:43 what is stated at Revelation 14:13.
16:47 It says there:
16:49 “The things they did go right with them.”
16:55 And how encouraging it is
16:58 to see young ones getting baptized
17:02 —publicly demonstrating
17:05 that they are giving their lives to Jehovah.
17:08 And we sincerely hope
17:10 that you young ones  who are not yet baptized
17:13 will not hold back from getting baptized
17:17 as soon as you qualify.
17:20 The sooner you can get baptized,
17:22 the sooner you will receive  greater protection
17:27 and blessings from Jehovah.
17:30 Not long ago,  it made me very happy
17:34 to observe a little ten-year-old brother
17:37 get baptized!
17:40 And young ones,
17:42 never be afraid to identify yourselves
17:47 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
17:50 Never allow the fear  of what others may think
17:54 to cause you to hesitate to do so.
17:58 Jehovah tells us
18:00 at Proverbs 29:25:
18:03 “Trembling at men is a snare,
18:09 “but the one trusting in Jehovah
18:12 will be protected.”
18:15 Many years ago when I was in school,
18:19 I can remember being  at times somewhat worried
18:23 about how my fellow classmates  would view me.
18:28 But then a little while later,
18:31 I got out of school
18:33 and never ever again even saw
18:36 most of those former classmates.
18:39 Then it dawned on me
18:42 that it doesn’t really matter  what people think about us.
18:46 It is Jehovah’s rating of us
18:49 that truly counts.
18:52 Humans cannot add
18:55 even five seconds to our lifespan,
18:58 but Jehovah can add
19:01 or subtract eternity.
19:05 And he alone  can also give us true happiness.
19:09 And as Proverbs 29:25 indicates,
19:14 what a protection
19:16 it is to courageously identify ourselves
19:21 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
19:23 fully trusting Jehovah
19:26 and taking our stand solidly with him.
19:31 Never be ashamed of who you are.
19:36 You are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
19:43 And please, dear young ones,
19:45 we warmly encourage you
19:48 to listen to those who love you.
19:52 Jehovah loves you very much;
19:54 the Governing Body loves you very much;
19:58 the elders love you very much;
20:01 your Christian parents love you very much.
20:04 And these ones will tell you the truth,
20:08 even though at times
20:10 it may not be what you want to hear.
20:13 They will not ‘tickle your ears,’
20:16 perhaps like ones at school
20:19 or in the neighborhood
20:21 who don’t really love you
20:23 or have your best interests at heart.
20:27 But please believe those
20:29 who will tell you the truth
20:32 because they love you.
20:34 And never view  Jehovah’s laws and principles
20:39 as depriving you of something good.
20:43 View them as protecting you
20:47 from what will hurt you.
20:49 If you recall,
20:52 Satan convinced Eve
20:54 that she was being deprived by Jehovah
20:57 and was missing out on something good.
21:01 Now, it is true that Eve  was missing out on something.
21:05 But what was she really missing out on?
21:09 A tormented conscience,
21:12 her beautiful hair turning gray,
21:15 her teeth falling out,
21:17 her perfect skin wrinkling up like a prune,
21:22 being bent over from old age,
21:26 hobbling around on a cane,
21:29 and finally dying!
21:33 But Satan convinced her
21:36 that Jehovah was depriving her,
21:39 so foolishly she reached out to get
21:44 what she thought she was missing out on.
21:48 Well, Satan will try to use
21:51 the same kind of strategy on you,
21:54 but please don’t let him do it!
22:00 This also makes me think  of an experience a brother once related.
22:06 He said that he was visiting  an animal observatory,
22:10 and a large lion lunged toward him
22:14 but was prevented from reaching him
22:17 by a thick glass pane
22:19 separating the animals from the observers.
22:24 As the lion stood on his hind legs,
22:27 clawing the glass
22:30 and baring his massive teeth,
22:34 the brother came to realize in a special way
22:37 the protective value of that barrier.
22:43 Previously, he said  that he somewhat viewed the glass pane
22:47 as a restriction
22:49 because the smudges on it
22:52 partially blurred his view,
22:55 but now he viewed it
22:58 as a real protection.
23:01 Well, in a similar way,
23:03 Jehovah doesn’t want Satan,
23:07 who is described  as ‘a roaring, devouring lion’
23:12 at 1 Peter 5:8—
23:14 He doesn’t want him  to gobble down you young ones.
23:19 And His laws and principles
23:22 are designed to keep that  from happening to you.
23:26 So please listen to Jehovah.
23:30 He loves you!

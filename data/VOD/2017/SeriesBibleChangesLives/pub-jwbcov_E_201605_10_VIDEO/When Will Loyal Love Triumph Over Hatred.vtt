00:02.982 --> 00:05.359
My childhood was not easy. 


00:05.358 --> 00:07.401
Actually, it was a hard one.


00:07.402 --> 00:10.280
All my life I thought and dreamed, 


00:10.280 --> 00:13.033
‘Why can’t all of us live free?’


00:13.033 --> 00:15.701
You are not allowed 
to express your opinion, 


00:15.702 --> 00:17.830
or to go where you want; 


00:17.830 --> 00:20.290
the Jews can, 
but you are not allowed 


00:20.290 --> 00:22.458
because you are an Arab.


00:22.458 --> 00:25.000
I felt angry 
because of the injustice and animosity.


00:26.005 --> 00:28.007
So I started to say to myself,


00:28.007 --> 00:32.427
‘I want to take action! 
I want to push the Jews away.’


00:32.427 --> 00:36.724
So I became the leader of a cell 
that opposed the occupation.


00:36.723 --> 00:41.770
Because of this, I was imprisoned 
from 1985 for four years.


00:41.770 --> 00:43.772
‘Why?’ 


00:43.772 --> 00:46.567
I had this question on my mind all the time. 


00:46.567 --> 00:49.000
‘Why? Why?’


00:50.528 --> 00:53.990
Then something happened 
that changed my whole life. 


00:53.990 --> 00:57.578
A subscription to The Watchtower magazine 
was made for me.


00:57.578 --> 01:00.080
This is what I had been looking for


01:00.080 --> 01:04.000
—peace, security, 
happiness, and satisfaction. 


01:04.000 --> 01:07.128
These things had been missing 
since my childhood.


01:07.128 --> 01:11.000
I looked and found them in the truth.


01:12.258 --> 01:14.845
Nothing will stop the bloodshed on the earth, 


01:14.845 --> 01:16.847
nothing but the Kingdom.


01:16.847 --> 01:19.099
I maintain my relationship with Jehovah 


01:19.098 --> 01:21.726
and hold on to what I learned. 


01:21.727 --> 01:23.000
This changed me.


01:35.950 --> 01:38.910
I was raised as a Jew.


01:38.910 --> 01:40.912
We are taught from childhood 


01:40.912 --> 01:43.415
that we are the chosen nation, 


01:43.415 --> 01:47.000
that God supports this nation.


01:48.170 --> 01:50.172
Where I lived, 


01:50.172 --> 01:54.000
I was surrounded by people who hated Arabs.


01:55.718 --> 01:58.638
I remembered people saying the expression 


01:58.638 --> 02:01.000
that “a good Arab is a dead Arab.”


02:03.602 --> 02:05.604
There was a saying, 


02:05.603 --> 02:07.731
“If someone comes to kill you, 


02:07.732 --> 02:10.775
kill him first.” 


02:10.775 --> 02:13.000
They used to claim 
that this was a quote from the Bible.


02:17.867 --> 02:20.160
When I learned the truth,  


02:20.160 --> 02:22.370
all the barriers between us 


02:22.370 --> 02:25.165
fell down.


02:25.165 --> 02:29.337
For me, this was something 
that was very refreshing, 


02:29.337 --> 02:32.757
to know that Jehovah 
expects us to love everyone, 


02:32.757 --> 02:35.175
people from all backgrounds, 


02:35.175 --> 02:36.885
including Arabs.


02:36.885 --> 02:40.638
Today, I am happy 
to be in Jehovah’s army 


02:40.638 --> 02:43.808
where millions of people 
belong to Jehovah’s army, 


02:43.808 --> 02:46.728
and they don’t serve 
to fight other people. 


02:46.728 --> 02:50.773
They serve him to save 
other people’s lives 


02:50.773 --> 03:14.820
from all the nations 
and from all sorts of backgrounds.

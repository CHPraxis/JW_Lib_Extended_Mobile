00:02 My childhood was not easy.
00:05 Actually, it was a hard one.
00:07 All my life I thought and dreamed,
00:10 ‘Why can’t all of us live free?’
00:13 You are not allowed  to express your opinion,
00:15 or to go where you want;
00:17 the Jews can,  but you are not allowed
00:20 because you are an Arab.
00:22 I felt angry  because of the injustice and animosity.
00:26 So I started to say to myself,
00:28 ‘I want to take action!  I want to push the Jews away.’
00:32 So I became the leader of a cell  that opposed the occupation.
00:36 Because of this, I was imprisoned  from 1985 for four years.
00:41 ‘Why?’
00:43 I had this question on my mind all the time.
00:46 ‘Why? Why?’
00:50 Then something happened  that changed my whole life.
00:53 A subscription to The Watchtower magazine  was made for me.
00:57 This is what I had been looking for
01:00 —peace, security,  happiness, and satisfaction.
01:04 These things had been missing  since my childhood.
01:07 I looked and found them in the truth.
01:12 Nothing will stop the bloodshed on the earth,
01:14 nothing but the Kingdom.
01:16 I maintain my relationship with Jehovah
01:19 and hold on to what I learned.
01:21 This changed me.
01:35 I was raised as a Jew.
01:38 We are taught from childhood
01:40 that we are the chosen nation,
01:43 that God supports this nation.
01:48 Where I lived,
01:50 I was surrounded by people who hated Arabs.
01:55 I remembered people saying the expression
01:58 that “a good Arab is a dead Arab.”
02:03 There was a saying,
02:05 “If someone comes to kill you,
02:07 kill him first.”
02:10 They used to claim  that this was a quote from the Bible.
02:17 When I learned the truth,
02:20 all the barriers between us
02:22 fell down.
02:25 For me, this was something  that was very refreshing,
02:29 to know that Jehovah  expects us to love everyone,
02:32 people from all backgrounds,
02:35 including Arabs.
02:36 Today, I am happy  to be in Jehovah’s army
02:40 where millions of people  belong to Jehovah’s army,
02:43 and they don’t serve  to fight other people.
02:46 They serve him to save  other people’s lives
02:50 from all the nations  and from all sorts of backgrounds.

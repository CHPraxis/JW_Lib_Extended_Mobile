00:05.025 --> 00:06.485
Are you OK?


00:06.485 --> 00:07.945
Brian, I’m worried.


00:07.945 --> 00:09.947
You need more money.


00:09.947 --> 00:11.407
Jehovah will take care of us. 


00:11.407 --> 00:13.367
He always has. 


00:13.367 --> 00:15.285
We have enough.


00:15.285 --> 00:16.787
Maybe enough for today, 


00:16.787 --> 00:19.499
but what if you get sick?


00:19.498 --> 00:22.793
Gloria’s mother keeps badgering her 
and me to move up.


00:22.793 --> 00:24.795
I can get a job 
at my uncle’s real estate firm. 


00:24.795 --> 00:27.000
Maybe this is an answer 
to our prayers.


00:28.798 --> 00:30.968
What about your pioneering?


00:30.968 --> 00:32.000
What about it? 
I can do both.


00:33.803 --> 00:36.140
Gloria, I must congratulate you 


00:36.140 --> 00:39.100
on your hard work with my company.


00:39.100 --> 00:42.000
But you must learn 
to keep your religion in its place.


00:43.480 --> 00:47.735
We’re neglecting 
family worship, study, service. 


00:47.735 --> 00:49.987
We’ve even become too busy, 


00:49.987 --> 00:52.000
or maybe too ashamed, 
to even pray together.


00:54.157 --> 00:55.742
I’m concerned about you.


00:55.742 --> 00:58.037
One of the things 
that you always talked to me about 


00:58.037 --> 01:00.497
was Matthew 6:24: 


01:00.497 --> 01:03.500
‘You cannot slave for God and for Riches.’


01:03.500 --> 01:07.000
You’re not the same person 
that I once knew.


01:08.713 --> 01:10.423
Dad, 


01:10.423 --> 01:11.716
where is Mom?


01:11.717 --> 01:15.000
She is coming, right?


01:16.972 --> 01:19.015
Is it really wrong 


01:19.015 --> 01:21.000
to try to improve our life?


01:22.018 --> 01:23.561
Mom. 


01:23.562 --> 01:24.897
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


01:24.897 --> 01:25.730
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


01:25.730 --> 01:46.982
“Remember the wife of Lot.”

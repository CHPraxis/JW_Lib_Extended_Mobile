00:01.083 --> 00:03.853
When we arrive 
at the Kingdom Hall for a meeting, 


00:03.853 --> 00:06.355
don’t you agree 
that we all feel refreshed 


00:06.355 --> 00:10.860
the moment we see the smiling faces 
of our brothers and sisters? 


00:10.860 --> 00:12.962
That’s how I feel. 


00:12.962 --> 00:17.634
Sometimes we can even take 
our beautiful meeting location for granted. 


00:17.633 --> 00:21.103
But did you know 
that a lot of work goes into making sure 


00:21.103 --> 00:24.473
that our Kingdom Halls are well utilized? 


00:24.473 --> 00:28.678
The Worldwide Design/Construction 
Department, or WDC, 


00:28.678 --> 00:32.048
is tasked with analyzing 
our worldwide needs 


00:32.048 --> 00:35.585
and providing direction 
to Local Design/Construction Departments 


00:35.585 --> 00:40.000
on how best to use 
our dedicated funds.


00:43.358 --> 00:46.328
As we approach the end 
of the present system of things, 


00:46.328 --> 00:49.165
Jehovah continues to speed up the work. 


00:49.165 --> 00:53.168
We now have 
more than 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide, 


00:53.168 --> 00:55.338
and the demand is still growing. 


00:55.338 --> 00:58.206
Jehovah’s blessing 
on the Kingdom work is undeniable, 


00:58.207 --> 01:01.912
as this could not 
have been accomplished otherwise.


01:01.912 --> 01:05.115
Many have been working for years 
in support of Kingdom Hall 


01:05.115 --> 01:08.117
and Assembly Hall construction projects, 


01:08.117 --> 01:11.120
most recently as part 
of the Local Design/Construction, 


01:11.120 --> 01:14.123
or LDC, program. 


01:14.123 --> 01:18.828
This program was implemented 
during the 2014 service year 


01:18.828 --> 01:22.000
and unifies the approach 
for construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide.


01:23.567 --> 01:26.235
What has been accomplished 
since the program started? 


01:26.235 --> 01:28.772
At the end of the 2000 service year, 


01:28.772 --> 01:32.575
half of the publishers worldwide 
met in suitable meeting places. 


01:32.575 --> 01:34.910
However, the other half


01:34.910 --> 01:37.313
—approximately three million publishers—


01:37.313 --> 01:39.415
met in places that were overcrowded 


01:39.415 --> 01:41.952
or otherwise unsuitable as Kingdom Halls.


01:41.952 --> 01:43.954
At that time, 


01:43.953 --> 01:47.156
27,000 Kingdom Halls were needed. 


01:47.157 --> 01:50.294
By 2014, 
the number of publishers meeting 


01:50.293 --> 01:53.563
in unsuitable facilities had been reduced. 


01:53.563 --> 01:56.165
But because of growth in the organization, 


01:56.165 --> 01:59.535
this still meant that 1.6 million publishers 


01:59.535 --> 02:02.138
did not have a suitable meeting place.


02:02.138 --> 02:04.140
Since 2014, 


02:04.140 --> 02:06.442
that figure has been reduced 


02:06.442 --> 02:08.444
by 25 percent. 


02:08.443 --> 02:11.546
What accounts for this significant reduction 
in the backlog, 


02:11.547 --> 02:14.984
allowing us to catch up faster 
than in the past? 


02:14.983 --> 02:16.986
Part of the answer 


02:16.987 --> 02:20.000
lies in making efficient use 
of the facilities we already have. 


02:21.390 --> 02:23.458
When providing food for thousands, 


02:23.458 --> 02:26.863
Jesus made it clear 
that nothing should be wasted. 


02:26.863 --> 02:29.765
The LDC program applies that principle 


02:29.765 --> 02:32.135
to the seats in our Kingdom Halls.


02:32.135 --> 02:33.803
As noted earlier, 


02:33.803 --> 02:37.006
we have 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide. 


02:37.007 --> 02:39.442
On average, 
only 60 percent of the seats 


02:39.442 --> 02:41.744
are filled for congregation meetings. 


02:41.743 --> 02:46.381
That means that approximately three 
to four million seats are empty 


02:46.382 --> 02:49.452
during congregation meetings each week. 


02:49.452 --> 02:53.557
There are a number of options 
to help make better use of these seats, 


02:53.557 --> 02:56.894
which will make the use 
of each Kingdom Hall more efficient.


02:56.893 --> 02:58.895
Consider, for example, 


02:58.895 --> 03:00.897
a Kingdom Hall in an urban area. 


03:00.897 --> 03:02.899
It has 200 seats 


03:02.898 --> 03:05.000
and is used 
by four congregations sharing the facility. 


03:06.635 --> 03:09.138
That means the Kingdom Hall will be in use 


03:09.138 --> 03:11.140
for four weeknight meetings 


03:11.140 --> 03:13.142
and four weekend meetings.


03:13.142 --> 03:15.612
It would definitely appear 
to be fully utilized 


03:15.612 --> 03:17.614
and suggests the need 


03:17.613 --> 03:20.081
for new construction for further growth. 


03:20.082 --> 03:23.620
However, 
how many seats were in the Kingdom Hall? 


03:23.620 --> 03:25.622
Two hundred. 


03:25.622 --> 03:28.424
Multiplied by meetings 
for the four congregations, 


03:28.423 --> 03:31.126
this facility has a total seating capacity 


03:31.127 --> 03:33.195
of 800 people. 


03:33.195 --> 03:35.532
Global records indicate that congregations 


03:35.532 --> 03:37.534
using this size Kingdom Hall 


03:37.533 --> 03:39.535
have an average attendance 


03:39.535 --> 03:41.905
of 120 at their meeting. 


03:41.905 --> 03:45.808
This could mean 
that only 480 seats are used 


03:45.808 --> 03:48.376
by the four congregations 
in this Kingdom Hall 


03:48.377 --> 03:51.514
and 320 seats remain empty


03:51.513 --> 03:53.750
—not very efficient.


03:53.750 --> 03:56.518
If the four congregations were redistributed 


03:56.518 --> 03:58.520
into three congregations, 


03:58.520 --> 04:01.423
average meeting attendance 
for each congregation 


04:01.423 --> 04:04.360
would increase 
to about 160 per meeting, 


04:04.360 --> 04:07.063
while still fitting comfortably 
in that Kingdom Hall. 


04:07.063 --> 04:10.666
And this would now allow 
for an open slot in the schedule, 


04:10.667 --> 04:13.435
which could be used 
to meet needs in the area 


04:13.435 --> 04:16.605
without requiring new construction.


04:16.605 --> 04:19.975
In the first three years of the LDC program, 


04:19.975 --> 04:22.845
fully utilizing our existing facilities 


04:22.845 --> 04:26.348
played a part in reducing 
the backlog of Kingdom Hall projects 


04:26.348 --> 04:29.951
from 14,000 to approximately 10,000. 


04:29.952 --> 04:32.522
This saved millions of dollars. 


04:32.522 --> 04:35.292
Of course, this does not meet every need, 


04:35.292 --> 04:37.294
and there is still a significant need 


04:37.293 --> 04:42.665
to construct new Kingdom Halls 
to provide suitable places of worship.


04:42.665 --> 04:44.667
How does the branch office 
make these decisions, 


04:44.667 --> 04:47.000
and how are priorities set? 


04:48.037 --> 04:50.039
All options are examined 
as the Branch Committees 


04:50.038 --> 04:52.041
work with their Local Design/Construction 


04:52.042 --> 04:54.044
and Service departments. 


04:54.043 --> 04:56.878
Transportation needs
—such as distance, 


04:56.878 --> 04:58.915
opportunities for carpooling, 


04:58.915 --> 05:01.150
and availability 
of public transportation—


05:01.150 --> 05:04.653
are taken into account. 


05:04.653 --> 05:07.156
In many cases, 
congregations can be sized 


05:07.157 --> 05:09.225
to make better use of available seats 


05:09.225 --> 05:12.228
in Kingdom Halls 
that have already been built. 


05:12.228 --> 05:14.496
However, 
when they are needed, 


05:14.497 --> 05:18.434
new Kingdom Halls can be constructed 
using simple, standard designs 


05:18.433 --> 05:21.970
that make wise use of donated funds.


05:21.970 --> 05:25.000
Of course, all of this must be done 
with the big picture in mind. 


05:26.242 --> 05:28.779
It is the spiritual needs 
of the congregations 


05:28.778 --> 05:30.000
that are of the utmost priority. 


05:32.782 --> 05:35.785
The structures themselves are not 
the focus of these centers of pure worship, 


05:35.785 --> 05:40.000
but rather it is the people 
who use the facilities.


05:41.048 --> 05:43.726
On one occasion, 
as they passed the temple, 


05:43.727 --> 05:46.595
Mark 13:1 quotes one of Jesus’ disciples 


05:46.595 --> 05:48.898
admiring the structure when he said: 


05:48.898 --> 05:53.068
“Teacher, see! 
what wonderful stones and buildings!” 


05:53.068 --> 05:54.370
However, 


05:54.370 --> 05:56.638
Jesus’ reply simply indicated 


05:56.638 --> 05:59.975
that the building itself would not last. 


05:59.975 --> 06:03.947
It was people Jesus was concerned with.


06:03.947 --> 06:06.949
Likewise, 
the Kingdom Halls that we build today 


06:06.948 --> 06:09.951
will not last forever. 


06:09.952 --> 06:12.689
But these centers of pure worship 
bring people together 


06:12.688 --> 06:15.991
so that we can serve Jehovah 
as a united group


06:15.992 --> 06:19.000
—and that will last forever.


06:20.430 --> 06:22.332
Whether we assist in the construction 


06:22.332 --> 06:25.449
of the many Kingdom Halls 
that are still needed 


06:25.448 --> 06:27.936
or help to renovate and maintain 
existing Kingdom Halls, 


06:27.937 --> 06:30.664
it is our shared privilege 
to help provide 


06:30.663 --> 06:33.000
suitable meeting places 
for our brothers and sisters. 


06:34.432 --> 06:36.434
In this way, 


06:36.433 --> 06:38.848
we each support 
“the faithful and discreet slave” 


06:38.848 --> 06:42.451
as they provide what is needed 
so that each congregation 


06:42.452 --> 06:57.050
can praise Jehovah 
in a suitable place of worship.

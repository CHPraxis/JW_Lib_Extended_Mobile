00:05.420 --> 00:08.060
In the Netherlands, 
there was a need for a new, 


00:08.060 --> 00:11.060
suitable Assembly Hall, 
which could accommodate almost all 


00:11.060 --> 00:16.380
of the 300 congregations 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


00:16.380 --> 00:20.860
Additional building ground 
was acquired next to the existing hall, 


00:20.860 --> 00:23.000
so that a second, 
completely new hall could be constructed.


00:27.580 --> 00:30.000
More than 200 volunteers 
worked on this project. 


00:32.060 --> 00:34.940
What challenges did they face? 


00:34.940 --> 00:37.000
And what blessings did they receive?


00:41.978 --> 00:45.380
We had to sell our house 
and close our business.


00:45.380 --> 00:48.740
It’s a step into the unknown.


00:48.740 --> 00:50.000
I had to quit my job.


00:51.978 --> 00:53.978
It was exciting to step 


00:53.978 --> 00:55.740
out of my comfort zone 


00:55.740 --> 00:58.000
and rely completely on Jehovah.


00:59.260 --> 01:01.740
Everything is structured, organized. 


01:01.740 --> 01:02.000
That is why things run smoothly. 


01:03.060 --> 01:06.000
That doesn’t come naturally to me.


01:07.098 --> 01:09.780
We were invited to come 
and work in the kitchen. 


01:09.780 --> 01:11.780
I love to cook at home. 


01:11.780 --> 01:13.580
I’m really fond of it. 


01:13.580 --> 01:15.380
What was my assignment? 


01:15.380 --> 01:18.000
Doing the dishes.


01:26.818 --> 01:29.180
Working on yourself, 


01:29.180 --> 01:31.180
your Christian personality, 


01:31.180 --> 01:33.940
and cooperating 
with your brothers and sisters


01:33.940 --> 01:38.060
—that has everlasting value.


01:38.060 --> 01:40.780
It was wonderful training for the future 


01:40.780 --> 01:43.620
when we will be building together 
in Paradise.


01:43.620 --> 01:45.258
You realize that everyone 


01:45.258 --> 01:47.500
sacrifices something and becomes happier. 


01:47.500 --> 01:49.860
No one regrets their decision.


01:49.860 --> 01:52.900
That Jehovah takes into account 
your personal makeup, 


01:52.900 --> 01:55.860
that he is patient with us.


01:55.860 --> 01:58.660
I’ve really learned how to work together 


01:58.660 --> 02:01.000
in a theocratic arrangement 
and still have fun.


02:02.428 --> 02:05.140
You can work on yourself all day long 


02:05.140 --> 02:07.980
and therefore be able to improve.


02:07.980 --> 02:12.940
I really learned to study more 
and to read the Bible more often.


02:12.940 --> 02:16.220
Because we worked together so closely, 


02:16.220 --> 02:18.220
you got to know each other very well 


02:18.220 --> 02:21.000
and I really started 
to love and appreciate people.


02:24.700 --> 02:26.980
We really came to appreciate 


02:26.980 --> 02:31.000
that every brother and sister 
has this beautiful inner person.


02:36.540 --> 02:39.740
Visitors and contractors 
were always very surprised 


02:39.740 --> 02:43.000
that there were so many women 
working at the construction site.


02:44.220 --> 02:46.418
It’s great working with sisters. 


02:46.418 --> 02:48.138
I have a construction background, 


02:48.138 --> 02:50.138
and communication with men 
can be really up front. 


02:50.138 --> 02:52.260
That doesn’t work with sisters. 


02:52.260 --> 02:54.260
You just have to be calm, 


02:54.260 --> 02:58.000
talk, and listen.


03:06.540 --> 03:09.580
I had to work on a lift platform, 


03:09.580 --> 03:12.660
but that was kind of a problem 
because I’m afraid of heights. 


03:12.660 --> 03:16.048
The brothers were so kind 
to seal the sides up completely 


03:16.048 --> 03:19.260
so that I could not look down.


03:19.260 --> 03:22.060
It was fun working together 
on that lift platform. 


03:22.060 --> 03:24.260
We called it our little flat.


03:24.260 --> 03:29.000
The atmosphere was amazing, 
and we all had a great time.


03:35.380 --> 03:37.540
Now we work in the kitchen 


03:37.540 --> 03:41.180
at the Swifterbant School Facility
—a real privilege. 


03:41.180 --> 03:43.540
We’ve been trained 
to cook during construction, 


03:43.540 --> 03:46.000
but if needed,
I’ll even do the dishes as well.


03:49.060 --> 03:51.340
I’ll never work five days again. 


03:51.340 --> 03:52.940
Now I work three days, 


03:52.940 --> 03:54.900
and since July 1st, 
I started pioneering. 


03:54.900 --> 03:56.580
That’s just great.


03:56.580 --> 03:58.580
He was offered a job. 


03:58.580 --> 04:00.580
He could even choose between two jobs. 


04:00.580 --> 04:04.000
Now he works three days a week, 
which always seemed impossible.


04:05.180 --> 04:09.020
Eventually, we were 
in Swifterbant for one month only.


04:09.020 --> 04:12.100
Then we went to Mozambique 
for three months.


04:12.100 --> 04:14.140
Then for five months 
to Swifterbant again.


04:14.140 --> 04:17.000
Then three months in South Africa.


04:18.020 --> 04:23.000
Bethel called and assigned us 
to Congo (Kinshasa).


04:39.532 --> 04:42.882
All the volunteers who helped 
to make a success of this project— 


04:42.882 --> 04:44.900
Well, they had to give up a lot. 


04:44.900 --> 04:47.000
As a result, 
we can enjoy this beautiful hall.


04:50.260 --> 04:52.380
It’s amazing to be here. 


04:52.380 --> 04:54.340
It’s great to be encouraged 


04:54.340 --> 04:56.820
and to be strengthened for the ministry.


04:56.820 --> 04:59.300
If you think about it, 


04:59.300 --> 05:02.660
every day we have 
around 700 new brothers and sisters. 


05:02.660 --> 05:04.660
That means every three days 


05:04.660 --> 05:07.580
we could fill a hall like this 
with new brothers and sisters. 


05:07.580 --> 05:10.740
These kinds of halls 
are really needed worldwide 


05:10.740 --> 05:15.000
in order to provide education 
to all those additional brothers and sisters.


05:17.540 --> 05:20.338
It’s so faith-strengthening to be here. 


05:20.338 --> 05:22.778
Words cannot express it. 


05:22.778 --> 05:27.100
I feel so united, so warm, peaceful. 


05:27.100 --> 05:50.680
It’s so wonderful to be able 
to serve Jehovah together.

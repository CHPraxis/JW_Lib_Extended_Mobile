00:05 In the Netherlands,  there was a need for a new,
00:08 suitable Assembly Hall,  which could accommodate almost all
00:11 of the 300 congregations  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:16 Additional building ground  was acquired next to the existing hall,
00:20 so that a second,  completely new hall could be constructed.
00:27 More than 200 volunteers  worked on this project.
00:32 What challenges did they face?
00:34 And what blessings did they receive?
00:41 We had to sell our house  and close our business.
00:45 It’s a step into the unknown.
00:48 I had to quit my job.
00:51 It was exciting to step
00:53 out of my comfort zone
00:55 and rely completely on Jehovah.
00:59 Everything is structured, organized.
01:01 That is why things run smoothly.
01:03 That doesn’t come naturally to me.
01:07 We were invited to come  and work in the kitchen.
01:09 I love to cook at home.
01:11 I’m really fond of it.
01:13 What was my assignment?
01:15 Doing the dishes.
01:26 Working on yourself,
01:29 your Christian personality,
01:31 and cooperating  with your brothers and sisters
01:33 —that has everlasting value.
01:38 It was wonderful training for the future
01:40 when we will be building together  in Paradise.
01:43 You realize that everyone
01:45 sacrifices something and becomes happier.
01:47 No one regrets their decision.
01:49 That Jehovah takes into account  your personal makeup,
01:52 that he is patient with us.
01:55 I’ve really learned how to work together
01:58 in a theocratic arrangement  and still have fun.
02:02 You can work on yourself all day long
02:05 and therefore be able to improve.
02:07 I really learned to study more  and to read the Bible more often.
02:12 Because we worked together so closely,
02:16 you got to know each other very well
02:18 and I really started  to love and appreciate people.
02:24 We really came to appreciate
02:26 that every brother and sister  has this beautiful inner person.
02:36 Visitors and contractors  were always very surprised
02:39 that there were so many women  working at the construction site.
02:44 It’s great working with sisters.
02:46 I have a construction background,
02:48 and communication with men  can be really up front.
02:50 That doesn’t work with sisters.
02:52 You just have to be calm,
02:54 talk, and listen.
03:06 I had to work on a lift platform,
03:09 but that was kind of a problem  because I’m afraid of heights.
03:12 The brothers were so kind  to seal the sides up completely
03:16 so that I could not look down.
03:19 It was fun working together  on that lift platform.
03:22 We called it our little flat.
03:24 The atmosphere was amazing,  and we all had a great time.
03:35 Now we work in the kitchen
03:37 at the Swifterbant School Facility —a real privilege.
03:41 We’ve been trained  to cook during construction,
03:43 but if needed, I’ll even do the dishes as well.
03:49 I’ll never work five days again.
03:51 Now I work three days,
03:52 and since July 1st,  I started pioneering.
03:54 That’s just great.
03:56 He was offered a job.
03:58 He could even choose between two jobs.
04:00 Now he works three days a week,  which always seemed impossible.
04:05 Eventually, we were  in Swifterbant for one month only.
04:09 Then we went to Mozambique  for three months.
04:12 Then for five months  to Swifterbant again.
04:14 Then three months in South Africa.
04:18 Bethel called and assigned us  to Congo (Kinshasa).
04:39 All the volunteers who helped  to make a success of this project—
04:42 Well, they had to give up a lot.
04:44 As a result,  we can enjoy this beautiful hall.
04:50 It’s amazing to be here.
04:52 It’s great to be encouraged
04:54 and to be strengthened for the ministry.
04:56 If you think about it,
04:59 every day we have  around 700 new brothers and sisters.
05:02 That means every three days
05:04 we could fill a hall like this  with new brothers and sisters.
05:07 These kinds of halls  are really needed worldwide
05:10 in order to provide education  to all those additional brothers and sisters.
05:17 It’s so faith-strengthening to be here.
05:20 Words cannot express it.
05:22 I feel so united, so warm, peaceful.
05:27 It’s so wonderful to be able  to serve Jehovah together.

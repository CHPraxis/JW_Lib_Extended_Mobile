00:00 Earlier in the program,
00:03 we saw some examples  of how young ones
00:07 are building a future  with Jehovah.
00:11 But what impact are such efforts  having on the organization?
00:17 Let’s look at one example:
00:19 the construction  of the new world headquarters
00:22 at Warwick, New York.
00:27 Jehovah’s Witnesses built
1.6 million square feet (149,000 sq m)
00:32 in less than four years.
00:36 Of the 27,035 volunteers,
00:39 3,247 were between the ages of 19 and 25.
00:44 I thought this was a project
00:46 that was going to strictly need
00:49 very experienced brothers and sisters.
00:52 Early on, I realized I was wrong.
00:55 It was also going to take youthful energy
00:58 because of the volume of work.
01:00 The mix of older and younger ones
01:02 was really a helpful thing  on the Warwick project.
01:05 The older ones  brought skill and experience.
01:08 The younger ones  brought the energy, the muscle,
01:11 and the diligence to stay  with hard physical tasks
01:14 all the way through the project.
01:15 Whether it was in the kitchen or night watch
01:20 or the early 5:00 a.m. start  with the concrete crew
01:22 at 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-12°C),
01:23 their joy and their humility was outstanding
01:26 to accept any work that needed to be done.
01:28 And a lot of young ones,  brothers and sisters,
01:31 moved into the area  so they could commute.
01:33 And they would work  day after day tirelessly,
01:36 into the evenings even,  to have the project ready for the next day.
01:39 Their energy was just astonishing.
01:43 Jehovah loves young ones,  and he’s willing to invest in them
01:47 and train them and make them  a part of his organization.
01:52 And I saw that so much.
01:54 We had a lot of young people  who offered themselves
01:56 with technical skills.
01:58 But if the humility of these  very technically-skilled young people
02:03 didn’t match  or exceed their abilities,
02:05 then, really,  Jehovah couldn’t use them.
02:07 And they were willing to adjust,  and we really saw the benefit.
02:12 We knew and they knew
02:14 that they were building
02:16 not just a project at Warwick
02:19 —they were building  a spiritual project for Jehovah.
02:22 You could see Jehovah’s spirit  operating on them.
02:25 You could see them  mature so quickly.
02:30 These young brothers  are the next generation
02:32 of elders  and traveling overseers.
02:34 They’re to be commended  and highly respected
02:37 for the contribution  they made as young men.
02:39 They all talk about the effect
02:41 that their Bethel service has had on their outlook
02:44 and how they don’t want  to get caught up
02:46 in this world  and its daily pursuits.
02:50 Use the skills you’ve learned
02:53 here on this project and in Bethel.
02:56 You are needed.
02:58 Continue to keep your spirituality up
03:01 and to keep your association  at a high level.
03:06 The highest quality of life is when,
03:09 as clay, we put ourselves  in the hands of the Great Potter, Jehovah,
03:13 and we say:  “Here I am! Send me!”.
03:16 And I’m fully confident  they will have no regrets
03:20 building their future  with Jehovah.

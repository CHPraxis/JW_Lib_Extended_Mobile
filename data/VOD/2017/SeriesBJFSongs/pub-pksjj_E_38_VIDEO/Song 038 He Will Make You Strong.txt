00:00:02 There was a reason why  God brought the truth to you
00:00:10 And called you  from the darkness to the light.
00:00:15 Within your heart,  he saw the longing that you had
00:00:23 To search for him  and practice what is right.
00:00:30 You promised him in prayer  to do his will;
00:00:36 He helped you then,  and he will help you still.
00:00:44 With Jesus’ blood He bought you,  to God you now belong.
00:00:51 So he will make you firm,  and he will make you strong.
00:00:57 He’ll guide you and protect you,  as he has all along.
00:01:04 Yes, he will make you firm,  and he will make you strong.
00:01:17 God gave his own beloved Son  in your behalf;
00:01:25 On this account,  He wants you to succeed.
00:01:31 If He did not withhold  the gift of His dear Son,
00:01:39 Then never doubt He’ll give  the strength you need.
00:01:46 He won’t forget the faith  and love you’ve shown;
00:01:52 He will not fail  to care for all His own.
00:01:59 With Jesus’ blood He bought you,  to God you now belong.
00:02:06 So he will make you firm,  and he will make you strong.
00:02:12 He’ll guide you and protect you,  as he has all along.
00:02:20 Yes, he will make you firm,  and he will make you strong.

I sit and read,
and then I think.

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in my mind,
it’s like I’m there.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I take a journey
back through Bible times

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From high up
in the air.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I look down
and I get close

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can hear
what people say.

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It lets me know
they were a lot like me

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lots
of diff’rent ways.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I journey
with Jehovah’s friends;

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have
a lot to tell.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to read
about their lives

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And get
to know them well.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someday soon
the time will come

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they
will live again.

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll be there
to welcome them

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And tell them,
“I’m your friend!”

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy
all the time

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For them
to be Jehovah’s friend.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to pray
like me and try to be

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His friend
down to the end.

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:28.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I journey
with Jehovah’s friends;

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:31.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

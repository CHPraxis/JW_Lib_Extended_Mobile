00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our world is filled with breathtaking beauty.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did God create the earth
in such a special way?

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even from space,
it stands alone as wonderfully unique.

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God created the earth
with an abundance of water.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.094 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He placed it

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:34.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at just the right distance from the sun 

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:42.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and set its rotation at just the right speed.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave it a moon
to stabilize the earth’s tilt, 

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contributing to consistent seasons.

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he created an amazing variety

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of living creatures to share the earth with.

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did God put forth so much effort
to create this beautiful earth?

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he wanted to give
the first human couple,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam and Eve, a wonderful home.

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as they obeyed God,

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they and their children would live forever

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and expand the Paradise garden
to cover the entire globe.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was God’s purpose for the earth.

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:34.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happened?

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why isn’t the earth a paradise?

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They eventually grew old and died.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paradise was lost.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did this mean that God’s original purpose
for the earth had changed?

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that a father decides

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build a beautiful home for his son.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives it to him as a gift.

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But instead of being thankful,

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the son neglects his father’s gift

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the house falls into disrepair.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would a loving father do?

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he destroy the house
and all his hard work?

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he would patiently save it

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a family member who would appreciate it.

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,
although Adam rejected the gift,

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:52.651 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us that God didn’t change

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:54.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his purpose for the earth.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:58.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His purpose still stands.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to give this gift,

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:03.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an earth-wide paradise,

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to you to enjoy

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:09.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in happiness and health forever!

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may wonder:
‘How will Paradise be restored?

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you live forever on earth?’

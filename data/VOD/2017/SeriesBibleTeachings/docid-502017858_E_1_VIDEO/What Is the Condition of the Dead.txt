00:00:11 Nearly all religions teach
00:00:13 that part of a person survives death.
00:00:17 But what does the Bible teach?
00:00:20 God created the first man, Adam,
00:00:22 from the dust.
00:00:24 He had the opportunity to live forever.
00:00:28 But when he deliberately disobeyed God,
00:00:31 he was told that he would return to the dust
00:00:34 —ceasing to exist.
00:00:38 What about others who died after Adam?
00:00:41 When Jesus was told that his friend Lazarus died,
00:00:45 Jesus did not say that Lazarus had gone to heaven.
00:00:48 Rather, he said:
00:00:50 “Our friend has fallen asleep.”
00:00:53 What did he mean?
00:00:58 Just as someone in a deep sleep
00:01:01 is inactive and unaware of his surroundings,
00:01:05 the dead are not conscious of anything at all.
00:01:11 Further, just as a person can be awakened from a deep sleep,
00:01:16 the Bible shows that it is possible to be awakened from death.
00:01:21 Jesus did just that for his friend Lazarus.
00:01:29 Lazarus had been dead for four days.
00:01:33 If some part of Lazarus
00:01:35 had survived his death and gone to heaven,
00:01:38 would Jesus take him out of heaven
00:01:40 and force him to live on earth again?
00:01:43 No.
00:01:45 Lazarus was asleep in the grave.
00:01:48 Jesus gave him back his life
00:01:51 and reunited him with his family.
00:01:54 The Bible promises a time
00:01:56 when many people will be resurrected from the dead,
00:02:00 just as Lazarus was.
00:02:02 Jesus spoke of this wonderful hope when he said:
00:02:06 “The one who exercises faith in me,
00:02:08 even though he dies, will come to life.”
00:02:16 What is the resurrection?
00:02:20 How can you cope with the pain of grief?

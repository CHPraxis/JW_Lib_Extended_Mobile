Nearly all religions teach

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:16.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
that part of a person survives death.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does the Bible teach?

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
God created the first man, Adam,

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the dust.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had the opportunity to live forever.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when he deliberately disobeyed God,

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was told that he would return to the dust

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.391 line:10% position:50% align:center
—ceasing to exist.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about others who died after Adam?

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus was told
that his friend Lazarus died,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not say
that Lazarus had gone to heaven.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.613 line:10% position:50% align:center
Rather, he said:

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.907 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Our friend has fallen asleep.”

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he mean?

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as someone in a deep sleep

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
is inactive and unaware of his surroundings,

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:09.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dead are not conscious
of anything at all.

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:16.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, just as a person
can be awakened from a deep sleep,

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:19.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible shows that it is possible
to be awakened from death.

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:25.273 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus did just that for his friend Lazarus.

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:33.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lazarus had been dead for four days.

00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:35.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
If some part of Lazarus

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
had survived his death and gone to heaven,

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:40.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
would Jesus take him out of heaven

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:43.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and force him to live on earth again?

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:45.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:48.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lazarus was asleep in the grave.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:51.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus gave him back his life

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reunited him with his family.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible promises a time

00:01:56.346 --> 00:02:00.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
when many people
will be resurrected from the dead,

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Lazarus was.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:06.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus spoke of this wonderful hope
when he said:

00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:08.900 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The one who exercises faith in me,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.529 line:10% position:50% align:center
even though he dies, will come to life.”

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the resurrection?

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:23.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you cope with the pain of grief?

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.796 line:90% position:50% align:center

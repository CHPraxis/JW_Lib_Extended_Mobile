00:09.158 --> 00:11.160
Since the 1980’s, 


00:11.160 --> 00:14.163
the Central America branch 
has been organizing 


00:14.163 --> 00:18.033
special preaching campaigns
to seldom-worked territories  


00:18.033 --> 00:20.603
and unassigned territories
—both here in Mexico 


00:20.603 --> 00:22.571
and also throughout all of Central America. 


00:22.572 --> 00:24.640
Matter of fact, in the last campaign,


00:24.640 --> 00:28.378
we had 13,000 regular pioneers 


00:28.378 --> 00:31.246
assigned to over 900 congregations 


00:31.247 --> 00:34.384
and in some areas where 
there weren’t even congregations, 


00:34.383 --> 00:36.000
for example, in El Salvador.


00:37.620 --> 00:39.022
When we were assigned here, 


00:39.022 --> 00:40.657
we were told that there were no Witnesses, 


00:40.657 --> 00:43.359
no Bible studies, and no publishers. 


00:43.358 --> 00:46.695
This is the second meeting 
that we’ve had the public talk, 


00:46.695 --> 00:49.000
and today we had 12 new ones attend.


00:50.400 --> 00:52.868
Well, since we’re in a rural area, 


00:52.868 --> 00:54.670
you have to do a lot of walking. 


00:54.670 --> 00:56.672
We’ve had to deal with the cows 


00:56.672 --> 00:59.075
and other smaller creatures, like ticks.


00:59.075 --> 01:01.077
Eight or nine brothers 


01:01.077 --> 01:03.279
were staying in one house, 


01:03.278 --> 01:06.248
so they had to get up super early


01:06.248 --> 01:08.350
—sometimes at four in the morning—


01:08.350 --> 01:11.620
just to get ready on time.


01:11.620 --> 01:13.923
The brothers who come on these campaigns 


01:13.923 --> 01:17.493
come resolved to help the congregation. 


01:17.493 --> 01:19.095
They’re really enthusiastic 


01:19.095 --> 01:22.865
about the ministry, and it’s contagious.


01:22.865 --> 01:25.402
We’ve found many studies 
and many return visits. 


01:25.402 --> 01:27.704
We just don’t have enough time 
to care for them all.


01:27.703 --> 01:29.871
Some of the publishers are assigned 


01:29.872 --> 01:33.209
to areas where the congregations 
are small or they’re isolated. 


01:33.208 --> 01:36.211
For example, here in Mexico 
there was a group 


01:36.212 --> 01:40.384
of willing, energetic pioneers 
that were assigned to an area, 


01:40.383 --> 01:43.720
and it just injected life 
into the local publishers, 


01:43.720 --> 01:45.000
and even the entire congregation benefited.


01:47.890 --> 01:49.192
We could see that the congregation 


01:49.192 --> 01:50.860
really blossomed in showing 


01:50.860 --> 01:53.830
hospitality, generosity, and love. 


01:53.830 --> 01:56.398
It made the congregation more united,


01:56.398 --> 01:59.568
and we could tell they were happier.


01:59.568 --> 02:02.571
They encourage me 


02:02.572 --> 02:05.409
and make me want to preach more.


02:05.408 --> 02:08.443
At one point, we were surrounded by people; 


02:08.443 --> 02:10.380
they were so spiritually starved 


02:10.380 --> 02:12.882
that they were just asking us 
for publications.


02:12.882 --> 02:17.020
It always seems that the ones 
that go on these campaigns 


02:17.020 --> 02:20.590
never forget the experiences 
that they’ve had. 


02:20.590 --> 02:24.360
The brothers in Costa Rica 
are going to share their stories with us.


02:24.360 --> 02:26.428
I remember one sister 


02:26.428 --> 02:28.463
who said she had to sell bread 


02:28.463 --> 02:30.933
and other products for an entire year 


02:30.933 --> 02:34.936
just to be able to come 
and serve in our congregation.


02:34.937 --> 02:38.107
On one occasion, we preached to a lady 
who had ten children. 


02:38.107 --> 02:40.310
It really moved me when she showed up 


02:40.310 --> 02:43.278
at the Kingdom Hall 
with all of her ten children.


02:43.278 --> 02:45.415
The effort I make has even motivated 


02:45.415 --> 02:47.550
my mom to renew her Bible study 


02:47.550 --> 02:50.220
and get to know more about Jehovah.


02:50.220 --> 02:53.422
In fact, there were some territories 


02:53.422 --> 02:56.059
that we hadn’t preached in for four years 


02:56.058 --> 02:57.660
because they are so far away. 


02:57.660 --> 02:59.695
But thanks to these brothers 


02:59.695 --> 03:01.965
and the effort they made, 
we were able to cover 


03:01.965 --> 03:04.833
all of our congregation’s territory.


03:04.833 --> 03:07.470
Wow! 
I’m really happy 


03:07.470 --> 03:10.573
because just seeing the brothers here 
gives me strength to keep going.


03:10.573 --> 03:13.610
We met a young woman 
who had been praying all week 


03:13.610 --> 03:15.612
because she wanted to get to know God better. 


03:15.612 --> 03:17.614
She was going through a really tough time. 


03:17.613 --> 03:19.415
So when we showed her one of our tracts 


03:19.415 --> 03:20.783
and she saw that it was based on the Bible,  


03:20.783 --> 03:22.685
she burst into tears. 


03:22.685 --> 03:26.155
She realized it was 
the answer to her prayers.


03:26.155 --> 03:28.992
In Panama, 
the brothers and sisters have seen 


03:28.992 --> 03:31.294
the results of their hard work and effort. 


03:31.293 --> 03:33.563
Second Corinthians 9:6 says, 


03:33.563 --> 03:37.200
‘those that sow bountifully 
will reap bountifully.’ 


03:37.200 --> 03:40.737
And they’ve seen 
the truthfulness of those words.


03:40.737 --> 03:42.339
My family has benefited. 


03:42.338 --> 03:43.740
For example, my daughter 
got baptized 


03:43.740 --> 03:46.910
at the last assembly, 
and I’ve been encouraged as well. 


03:46.910 --> 03:49.045
Now I’m a regular pioneer.


03:49.045 --> 03:52.948
It generates a real pioneer spirit 
in the congregation 


03:52.948 --> 03:55.618
and that spurs the brothers on 
to greater activity. 


03:55.618 --> 03:59.088
Some even want to fill out 
auxiliary pioneer applications.


03:59.088 --> 04:01.423
When you come on a campaign like this, 


04:01.423 --> 04:02.625
something enjoyable is 


04:02.625 --> 04:04.393
that people you didn’t even know before 


04:04.393 --> 04:06.028
become your closest friends.


04:06.028 --> 04:09.431
My relationship with Jehovah 
has gotten stronger. 


04:09.432 --> 04:12.000
I’ve seen how he never abandons me.


04:13.568 --> 04:18.000
For many, these campaigns are a life-altering 
or life-changing experience.


04:20.242 --> 04:22.012
All the work 
that the brothers and sisters 


04:22.012 --> 04:24.780
put forth is worth it 


04:24.780 --> 04:27.450
when they see the gratitude 
and the appreciation 


04:27.450 --> 04:29.452
of their Bible students. 


04:29.452 --> 04:31.087
And Nicaragua is a country 


04:31.087 --> 04:35.000
where people show 
that gratefulness for spiritual things.


04:36.492 --> 04:39.562
We spoke with a farmer on one occasion. 


04:39.562 --> 04:41.999
And farmers in Nicaragua 
do not make very much, 


04:41.998 --> 04:45.635
but he was so appreciative 
of the publications we had placed with him 


04:45.635 --> 04:48.805
that he gave us a sum 
that could possibly amount 


04:48.805 --> 04:52.175
to a good fourth or a third 
of his daily wages.


04:52.175 --> 04:54.943
Anyone who has the opportunity 
to go on these campaigns


04:54.943 --> 04:56.778
—they would not regret it. 


04:56.778 --> 04:58.546
They would have amazing experiences. 


04:58.547 --> 04:59.982
I’ve done it myself. 


04:59.982 --> 05:01.350
And these experiences


05:01.350 --> 05:03.518
—these wonderful opportunities 
that one would have 


05:03.518 --> 05:05.521
to preach on these campaigns—


05:05.522 --> 05:18.519
would be remembered 
for the rest of their lives.

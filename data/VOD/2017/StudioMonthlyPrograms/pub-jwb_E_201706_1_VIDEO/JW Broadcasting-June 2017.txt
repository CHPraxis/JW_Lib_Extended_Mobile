00:01 Welcome to another edition  of JW Broadcasting!
00:05 Have you ever felt discouraged
00:08 due to circumstances beyond your control?
00:12 We’ll discuss how we can still have joy  despite our limitations.
00:17 And we’ll see examples,  both Biblical and modern day,
00:21 that will encourage us  to keep giving Jehovah our best.
00:25 Jonah had faced several reasons
00:28 to become discouraged and give up.
00:30 How did Jehovah help him carry on  with courage and faith?
00:35 And what lessons from his experience
00:38 can we apply to problems we face today?
00:41 Can we change  our personality for the better?
00:45 We can with Jehovah’s spirit  and diligent effort.
00:48 This brother describes
00:50 how far his personality and lifestyle
00:54 took him away from Jehovah.
00:55 He explains how he regained  a clean conscience
01:00 and freeness of speech.
01:02 Jehovah can turn tragic events  caused by man
01:06 into open doors of activity  for His loyal Witnesses.
01:09 In this report from Greece,
01:12 we’ll learn how our brothers  are bringing spiritual comfort
01:16 to refugees.
01:18 You’re watching the June 2017 edition
01:22 of JW Broadcasting!
01:44 There are many exciting things happening
01:47 in Jehovah’s organization.
01:49 Why, month after month, we read articles,
01:52 watch videos, and hear personal experiences
01:55 about our brothers and sisters  who are doing more for Jehovah.
01:59 They are serving where  the need is greater or reaching out
02:02 for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
02:05 They are working  on construction, renovation,
02:08 maintenance of Kingdom Halls,  or other theocratic projects.
02:12 No doubt,  many of you watching this program
02:16 are excitedly looking forward
02:18 to expanding your ministry  in one of these areas.
02:21 We encourage you to do so.
02:24 You can be assured  that you will receive much fulfillment
02:28 and many blessings from Jehovah.
02:31 On the other hand,
02:33 there are others  who are watching this program
02:36 who may feel discouraged  because their circumstances
02:39 may seem to limit  their being as involved as they would like.
02:44 What are some of these circumstances?
02:46 These may include our age, our health,
02:49 our economic situation,  or our physical limitations.
02:54 For some of us,  perhaps our upbringing
02:57 or past errors  we have made in our life
03:00 may cause us to feel  that we are limited
03:04 as to what we can do  for Jehovah.
03:07 As we know well,  focusing on our limitations
03:10 can affect our joy,  causing discouragement.
03:13 What can we do?
03:15 There are many examples  in the Scriptures of men and women
03:19 who had circumstances  beyond their control
03:22 that seemed to limit how much  they could do for Jehovah.
03:26 Others had to deal with the effects  of their upbringing and family life
03:31 or with serious errors they made.
03:34 Did they allow themselves to be limited
03:37 by their circumstances or their past?
03:40 How did Jehovah feel about them?
03:42 How does Jehovah feel about us?
03:46 That is what we are going to discuss  in this month’s broadcast,
03:50 which has the theme
03:51 “Are You Defined by Your Circumstances?”
03:55 Let’s start by looking at some
03:57 who could have let  their circumstances limit them.
04:01 Consider first the example  of Joseph in the book of Genesis.
04:06 Now, Joseph faced injustice at its worst.
04:08 His situation was especially hurtful
04:12 since it was initially brought on by those  who should have been closest to him
04:15 —his family!
04:17 As a slave in Egypt  and later as a prisoner,
04:20 Joseph was indeed limited  in what he could do.
04:24 How might Joseph have reacted?
04:27 Well,  Joseph could have become so preoccupied
04:30 with what he could not do
04:32 that he lost sight of what he could do.
04:35 Did Joseph let his circumstances
04:39 paralyze his life?
04:41 No!
04:42 He chose to make  the best of his situation.
04:45 In fact,  note what Joseph did
04:47 while serving as a slave  in Potiphar’s house
04:50 if we turn together  to Genesis 39:4:
04:55 “Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes,
04:58 “and he became his personal attendant.
05:01 “So he appointed him over his house,
05:03 and he put him  in charge of all that was his.”
05:07 Joseph worked diligently
05:09 within the limitations  of his circumstances.
05:13 He took a similar approach while in prison.
05:15 Joseph focused on what he could do
05:18 despite suffering the effects of injustice.
05:22 As a second example,  consider Hezekiah.
05:25 Hezekiah is one  who might easily have felt
05:28 that he was defined by his upbringing.
05:31 Look at the terrible example  that was set by his father, Ahaz,
05:36 as recorded in 2 Kings chapter 16.
05:40 Second Kings chapter 16,
05:43 and notice what verse 3 says about Ahaz:
05:47 “Instead, he walked in the way  of the kings of Israel,
05:52 “and he even made his own son  pass through the fire,
05:56 “following the detestable practices  of the nations
05:59 that Jehovah had driven out  from before the Israelites.”
06:03 Hezekiah’s father did detestable things
06:07 in opposition to Jehovah.
06:09 But Hezekiah showed
06:11 that he was not the helpless victim
06:13 of a poor parental example.
06:15 What did he do?
06:17 Well, turn in your Bibles  to 2 Kings chapter 18
06:21 and notice verse 3,
06:23 what it says about Hezekiah:
06:26 “He kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes,
06:30 just as David his forefather had done.”
06:33 Verse 5 says of Hezekiah:
06:36 “There was no one like him  among all the kings of Judah.”
06:40 He became fully involved in true worship.
06:43 Verses 6 and 7 say that Hezekiah
06:45 ‘held fast to Jehovah,  and Jehovah proved to be with him.’
06:51 How encouraging  Hezekiah’s example is for us!
06:56 We can choose to be loyal to Jehovah
06:58 and do much in our worship of Jehovah,
07:00 even if we did not grow up in a family
07:03 that served Jehovah fully.
07:05 We are not helpless victims  of our environment.
07:09 Hezekiah’s example  reassures us that our past
07:13 does not have to control our future.
07:17 As a third example,  consider the apostle Paul.
07:21 He did not let his own past mistakes
07:23 involving religious prejudice and violence
07:27 stop him from giving his all to Jehovah.
07:30 How did Paul feel about his past?
07:33 Well, let’s read together  at 1 Corinthians 15:9:
07:39 “For I am the least of the apostles,
07:43 “and I am not worthy  of being called an apostle,
07:46 because I persecuted  the congregation of God.”
07:50 “I am the least of the apostles.”
07:53 Later, when writing to the Ephesians  as recorded at Ephesians 3:8,
07:57 he calls himself  “less than the least of all holy ones.”
08:01 Finally, at 1 Timothy 1:15,
08:05 he now calls himself  the “foremost” of all sinners.
08:09 Yes,  Paul’s prior treatment of the congregation
08:13 weighed heavily upon him.
08:15 Could Paul have reasoned  that he was damaged?
08:19 Could he have reasoned that his past
08:21 limited what he could do for Jehovah?
08:23 He could have,  but Paul did not do that.
08:27 He poured himself out  for the congregation.
08:30 Why, Paul was privileged to write  more books and letters
08:33 in the Christian Greek Scriptures  than anyone else.
08:35 He demonstrated  an outstanding zeal for the ministry.
08:39 Paul did not let his conduct in the past
08:42 dictate what he could do for Jehovah.
08:46 And there are many other examples as well.
08:49 For example,  are we in a difficult economic situation?
08:53 The account in 2 Corinthians chapter 8
08:56 tells us about the Macedonians.
08:58 Paul says that they were in deep poverty.
09:02 Yet they begged to have a financial share
09:05 in the relief work.
09:07 Are we older in years?
09:09 We may think of Anna.
09:11 The account at Luke 2:36-38
09:14 tells us that she was 84 years old
09:17 and that her husband had died
09:19 after just seven years of marriage.
09:22 Yet,  “she was never missing from the temple.”
09:24 She rendered ‘sacred service day and night.’
09:28 What lessons do we learn  from these accounts?
09:33 Our dear brothers and sisters in Bible times were just like us.
09:37 Many were in circumstances that they would not have chosen.
09:41 Yet, they did not let their circumstances
09:44 or their past define them.
09:47 They joyfully did what they could
09:50 within the limits of their situation.
09:52 And these are just a few examples.
09:55 There are many others in the Bible.
09:57 Why not make it a personal study project
10:00 to research faithful ones
10:02 who were in circumstances  similar to yours?
10:06 How did they stay involved  in Jehovah’s work?
10:09 We are sure  that you will be greatly encouraged.
10:14 In fact,  let’s look at an example
10:16 of how you might do this  with a familiar Bible character.
10:20 In this dramatization,
10:22 a brother and two sisters  use their personal study time
10:26 to learn about Jonah.
10:29 Sometimes, as we know,  Jonah was discouraged
10:31 by events beyond his control;
10:34 at other times it was  because of his own failings.
10:38 Does Jonah’s experience relate
10:41 to what they are feeling?
10:43 And how do the lessons  Jonah learned help them
10:46 to not remain trapped  in their circumstances?
10:56 But John, there’s still plenty
10:59 you can do  in the congregation.
11:01 Sure, that sounds good.
11:04 But I’m no longer  a ministerial servant.
11:07 Why did I let my zeal  for the ministry cool off?
11:12 I know what the brothers  must think of me now.
11:18 Hello?
11:20 Oh, good morning.  My name is Jane.
11:22 How are you?
11:23 Not bad, thanks.
11:24 I know you may not be interested,
11:27 but I have this tract  I’d like to leave with you . . .
11:29 “You may not be interested?”
11:31 Where did that come from?
11:35 Not my best presentation,
11:37 but it didn’t seem like she wanted  to talk more anyway.
11:43 Well, what does that mean?
11:46 It may be manageable,
11:48 but long term,  given your other conditions,
11:50 you’re looking at possibly  some further tests . . .
11:51 Manageable?
11:52 Long term?
11:54 Oh, Jehovah,  how can I do this by myself?
12:17 Of course Jehovah values you.
12:20 Try to think of someone in the Bible
12:23 who may have felt like you do,  like Jonah.
12:27 Jonah?
12:29 Felt like I do?
12:40 “What comes to your mind when you think of Jonah?
12:44 Do you think of him  as a disobedient prophet?”
12:59 “Reluctant to obey Jehovah’s command,
13:02 “Jonah boarded a ship that carried him
13:05 farther and farther away  from his assignment.”
13:20 “Did Jonah’s recent actions
13:22 “disqualify him  from ever again serving God
13:26 in an official capacity?”
13:32 He sure could have thought so.
13:35 I know I do.
13:39 “No,
13:40 “Jehovah mercifully and lovingly
13:43 renewed the prophet’s commission.”
14:02 So if Jehovah didn’t see Jonah  as a total failure,
14:05 then what must he think of me?
14:12 First Samuel 16:7:
14:15 “For the way man sees
14:18 is not the way God sees.”
14:22 “Jonah did not see Nineveh  as Jehovah did.”
14:50 Well,
14:52 with all that they were doing,
14:53 how could he view them any differently?
14:57 But the account says:
14:59 ‘When God saw they had turned back  from their evil ways,
15:02 ‘he reconsidered the calamity,
15:04 and he did not bring it.’
15:08 “Despite the people’s badness,
15:10 “Jehovah cared about them.
15:13 “He values human life
15:15 “and the potential  that each individual has
15:18 for repenting and learning  to do what is right.”
15:23 Well, of course that’s true.
15:26 Why didn’t Jonah see that?
15:30 But am I seeing people the way Jehovah does?
15:36 Am I assuming they won’t listen
15:38 and then not giving my best?
15:42 How can I know  how a person will respond?
15:47 ‘Jonah learned to be merciful.
15:51 Will we?’
15:57 Matthew 5:7 says:
16:00 “Happy are the merciful,
16:03 since they will be shown mercy.”
16:09 “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God
16:12 “from the belly of the fish, and he said:
16:16 “‘Out of my distress
16:18 “‘I called out to Jehovah,
16:20 “‘and he answered me.
16:23 “‘Out of the depths of the Grave  I cried for help.
16:27 You heard my voice.’”
16:33 God heard Jonah and delivered him.
16:37 But I can’t expect a miracle.
16:45 “Then my prayer came in to you,  into your holy temple.”
16:50 “My prayer.”
16:53 “My prayer came in to you.”
16:57 Jonah didn’t know
16:59 if Jehovah would rescue him,
17:01 but he prayed in faith  that Jehovah cared.
17:05 “But as for me,
17:07 “with the voice of thanksgiving
17:09 “I will sacrifice to you.
17:12 “What I have vowed, I will pay.
17:15 Salvation is from Jehovah.”
17:25 As long as I still can,
17:28 I’ll keep sacrificing to God.
17:35 Salvation is from Jehovah!
17:44 Like those in our video,
17:46 do you sometimes feel as Jonah did?
17:49 Can you apply the lessons  from Jonah’s account
17:53 to better see God’s mercy  in your life?
17:56 A personal failing  discouraged our brother.
17:59 But like Jonah,
18:01 he realized Jehovah still valued him.
18:05 Our young sister  reinvigorated her ministry
18:09 after meditating on the way Jehovah
18:11 mercifully viewed the Ninevites.
18:14 And our sister was determined  to imitate Jonah’s faith
18:19 that God hears our prayers
18:21 about circumstances beyond our control.
18:25 Sometimes, however,
18:27 our circumstances  are only perceived barriers
18:31 to doing more for Jehovah.
18:33 For example, some may feel limited  by economic concerns
18:36 if they reach out for special privileges.
18:40 In the Netherlands,  many brothers and sisters
18:43 assisted with the construction  of the Swifterbant Assembly Hall.
18:47 Some had to make adjustments  to be able to work on this project.
18:51 Listen, however, to their comments  on the blessings they received
18:56 and what their goals are  now that the project is completed.
19:04 In the Netherlands,  there was a need for a new,
19:07 suitable Assembly Hall,  which could accommodate almost all
19:10 of the 300 congregations  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
19:15 Additional building ground  was acquired next to the existing hall,
19:19 so that a second,  completely new hall could be constructed.
19:26 More than 200 volunteers  worked on this project.
19:31 What challenges did they face?
19:34 And what blessings did they receive?
19:41 We had to sell our house  and close our business.
19:44 It’s a step into the unknown.
19:47 I had to quit my job.
19:51 It was exciting to step
19:53 out of my comfort zone
19:54 and rely completely on Jehovah.
19:58 Everything is structured, organized.
20:00 That is why things run smoothly.
20:02 That doesn’t come naturally to me.
20:06 We were invited to come  and work in the kitchen.
20:08 I love to cook at home.
20:10 I’m really fond of it.
20:12 What was my assignment?
20:14 Doing the dishes.
20:25 Working on yourself,
20:28 your Christian personality,
20:30 and cooperating  with your brothers and sisters
20:33 —that has everlasting value.
20:37 It was wonderful training for the future
20:39 when we will be building together  in Paradise.
20:42 You realize that everyone
20:44 sacrifices something and becomes happier.
20:46 No one regrets their decision.
20:48 That Jehovah takes into account  your personal makeup,
20:52 that he is patient with us.
20:54 I’ve really learned how to work together
20:57 in a theocratic arrangement  and still have fun.
21:01 You can work on yourself all day long
21:04 and therefore be able to improve.
21:07 I really learned to study more  and to read the Bible more often.
21:12 Because we worked together so closely,
21:15 you got to know each other very well
21:17 and I really started  to love and appreciate people.
21:23 We really came to appreciate
21:26 that every brother and sister  has this beautiful inner person.
21:35 Visitors and contractors  were always very surprised
21:38 that there were so many women  working at the construction site.
21:43 It’s great working with sisters.
21:45 I have a construction background,
21:47 and communication with men  can be really up front.
21:49 That doesn’t work with sisters.
21:51 You just have to be calm,
21:53 talk, and listen.
22:05 I had to work on a lift platform,
22:08 but that was kind of a problem  because I’m afraid of heights.
22:11 The brothers were so kind  to seal the sides up completely
22:15 so that I could not look down.
22:18 It was fun working together  on that lift platform.
22:21 We called it our little flat.
22:23 The atmosphere was amazing,  and we all had a great time.
22:34 Now we work in the kitchen
22:36 at the Swifterbant School Facility —a real privilege.
22:40 We’ve been trained  to cook during construction,
22:42 but if needed, I’ll even do the dishes as well.
22:48 I’ll never work five days again.
22:50 Now I work three days,
22:52 and since July 1st,  I started pioneering.
22:54 That’s just great.
22:55 He was offered a job.
22:57 He could even choose between two jobs.
22:59 Now he works three days a week,  which always seemed impossible.
23:04 Eventually, we were  in Swifterbant for one month only.
23:08 Then we went to Mozambique  for three months.
23:11 Then for five months  to Swifterbant again.
23:13 Then three months in South Africa.
23:17 Bethel called and assigned us  to Congo (Kinshasa).
23:38 All the volunteers who helped  to make a success of this project—
23:42 Well, they had to give up a lot.
23:44 As a result,  we can enjoy this beautiful hall.
23:49 It’s amazing to be here.
23:51 It’s great to be encouraged
23:53 and to be strengthened for the ministry.
23:55 If you think about it,
23:58 every day we have  around 700 new brothers and sisters.
24:01 That means every three days
24:03 we could fill a hall like this  with new brothers and sisters.
24:06 These kinds of halls  are really needed worldwide
24:09 in order to provide education  to all those additional brothers and sisters.
24:16 It’s so faith-strengthening to be here.
24:19 Words cannot express it.
24:21 I feel so united, so warm, peaceful.
24:26 It’s so wonderful to be able  to serve Jehovah together.
24:44 Did you notice a common thread  in the volunteers’ comments?
24:48 Any economic concerns they may have had
24:51 just faded into the background, didn’t they?
24:53 They reached out to help,  and in turn Jehovah helped them.
24:58 In fact, the Assembly Hall project was finished at a lower cost
25:02 and a year earlier than originally planned.
25:05 And did you note that after the project,
25:07 some who previously felt they couldn’t pioneer
25:10 reduced their secular workdays
25:13 and are now doing  what they thought was out of reach?
25:16 It brings us joy to see  so many making adjustments
25:21 and reaching out to do more  for the organization,
25:24 and in turn they experience  something they’ll never forget.
25:30 Now,  we’ve considered examples of those
25:32 who did not let  their circumstances hinder them
25:36 from giving their all to Jehovah.
25:38 But another question is:
25:41 How does Jehovah  view his faithful servants
25:44 despite their limitations?
25:47 Now, I’ve often thought  about the example of John the Baptizer.
25:50 As we know, he was arrested  shortly after Jesus started his ministry.
25:55 John could have felt
25:57 that he was no longer of use  to Jehovah or the work.
26:01 Yet, as recorded at Matthew 11:11,
26:05 Jesus said about John:
26:07 “Among those born of women,
26:09 there has not been raised up  anyone greater than John the Baptist.”
26:14 Jehovah’s and Jesus’ view of John
26:16 was not based  on the man’s circumstances
26:19 of being in prison.
26:21 Their view of John was based on who he was on the inside
26:25 and on his relationship with Jehovah.
26:28 Jehovah did not focus on the limitations.
26:32 In Jehovah’s eyes,  John was great.
26:35 He was still a faithful servant  doing the best that he could,
26:39 and that was all that really mattered.
26:42 Another example  that may come to your mind
26:45 is that of King David.
26:47 As we know,  King David committed serious sins.
26:51 Yet,  David repented for his sins,
26:53 and there is no record that he repeated them.
26:57 How did Jehovah view him?
27:00 Did Jehovah see David as damaged,
27:03 as a man who would always be limited in serving him?
27:07 Notice Jehovah’s words  directed to King Jeroboam
27:12 at 1 Kings 14:8:
27:16 “But you have not become  like my servant David,
27:20 “who kept my commandments
27:22 “and who walked after me  with all his heart,
27:25 doing only what was right in my eyes.”
27:28 Jehovah viewed David  as a special servant.
27:31 He says that he  “kept my commandments.”
27:34 He did  “what was right in my eyes.”
27:37 That’s what Jehovah remembered.
27:40 How encouraging that is for us!
27:43 If we have repented  of our past mistakes
27:45 and set matters straight  to the best of our circumstances,
27:49 we too can be assured  that Jehovah loves us dearly.
27:54 He appreciates whatever we can do  in our worship of him.
28:00 So, what’s the point?
28:02 Well, our past  or our present circumstances
28:06 do not define our value before Jehovah.
28:10 Our Father loves us for who we are,
28:13 and he values our efforts
28:15 as we do the best  that we can to serve him.
28:18 Why do you think it is important
28:22 that we strive to see ourselves  as Jehovah does?
28:25 Because we can weaken,  discourage, or limit ourselves
28:30 if we see ourselves only  in the framework of our circumstances.
28:35 May we work hard not to do that.
28:39 What does Jehovah see
28:42 when he looks  at his faithful servants today?
28:45 Well, turn, please,  to 1 Samuel 16:7.
28:50 And the setting is  that Samuel was about to go
28:53 to anoint the next king of Israel;
28:55 and he goes to the house of Jesse;  and Jesse lines up all of his sons,
28:58 except for David, who is still out in the field;
29:01 and Samuel walks in  and he sees Eliab.
29:05 And based on what he sees,
29:07 Samuel concludes that this surely must be
29:10 the next king of Israel.
29:12 Yet, note what Jehovah saw.
29:15 Please read with me 1 Samuel 16:7:
29:20 “But Jehovah said to Samuel:
29:23 “‘Do not pay attention  to his appearance and how tall he is,
29:27 “‘for I have rejected him.
29:29 “‘For the way man sees is not the way God sees,
29:34 “‘because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
29:38 but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”
29:41 That’s the way Jehovah sees.
29:44 He does not look  at our outward appearance and our abilities;
29:47 he sees into our hearts.
29:49 He sees what we would be doing
29:50 if all of the limitations  were lifted off of us.
29:53 Why, just the fact  that we keep going,
29:56 that we keep putting  one foot in front of the other,
29:59 endears us to Jehovah.
30:02 We understand the truth  of that statement,
30:05 and we all may agree
30:07 that this is how  Jehovah views his people.
30:10 However, we may have  a hard time convincing ourselves
30:15 if this really applies to me.
30:18 Have you ever wondered:  ‘Does Jehovah really see me?
30:22 ‘Does he see what’s in my heart
30:24 and value my desire to do more for him?’
30:28 The answer is yes.
30:30 In fact, Jehovah has already seen  what is in your heart.
30:35 Think about this:
30:37 Why are you watching this program?
30:40 Why do you care about spiritual things?
30:43 Why are you, perhaps,  the only one in your family
30:46 who is a dedicated,  baptized servant of Jehovah?
30:49 Or why are you, perhaps,  the only one at your place of employment
30:53 or the only one near where you live  who’s serving Jehovah?
30:57 Is it because you are  so much more studious
30:59 or smarter than everyone else?
31:02 No!
31:04 Haggai 2:7 tells us
31:07 that Jehovah  “will shake all the nations,
31:10 and the precious things  of all the nations will come in.”
31:14 John 6:44 says
31:17 that ‘no man can come to Jesus
31:20 unless the Father draws him.’
31:24 Jeremiah 31:3, Jehovah says:
31:29 “I have loved you with an everlasting love.
31:32 That is why I have drawn you.”
31:36 So again, why are you serving Jehovah?
31:39 Because Jehovah loves you.
31:41 Jehovah drew you.
31:43 As he was shaking the nations,
31:45 he looked down into your heart  and he saw something very precious
31:49 and he drew you to him.
31:51 He said,  “I want to draw this person to my Son.
31:53 “I want to draw this person to me.
31:56 I love this person.”
31:59 Jehovah drew you,
32:01 not because you have perfect circumstances,
32:04 but because of your heart and because he loves you.
32:08 He greatly appreciates  that his servants give their best to him.
32:15 But how do we know  that Jehovah really sees each one of us,
32:19 no matter where we are?
32:21 Consider an example:
32:23 Thousands of refugees who faced
32:26 severe hardships in their home countries
32:28 have sought shelter in parts of Europe.
32:32 Watch how Jehovah  has lovingly assured them
32:36 that they’re not alone  by satisfying their spiritual thirst.
32:44 Welcome to Greece!
32:46 We really feel that Jehovah is blessing us
32:49 by opening a large door
32:51 of opportunities to preach the good news
32:55 to the many refugees  who are streaming into the country.
33:01 For this reason, the brothers  immediately informed us of the situation
33:06 and we directed the bodies of elders
33:09 to concentrate on the harbors,  especially in Chios.
33:13 The brothers were willing to work in shifts
33:16 —24 hours a day.
33:21 The refugee shelters in our area  only have families with children
33:25 and are located near a military airport.
33:28 Whenever military planes flew overhead
33:31 and the children would see and hear them,
33:33 they would immediately run  and try to hide because they were afraid.
33:37 They sought protection  from the tragic conditions
33:39 they had experienced during warfare.
33:41 This impressed upon us  how greatly they needed
33:43 the comforting message of the good news,
33:46 so we felt the urge to approach them.
33:50 Therefore,  the Service Department arranged
33:54 for four language classes  to be held for the brothers.
33:59 We try to speak to people
34:01 in a language quite different from our own.
34:03 At times, we might think:
34:04 ‘Will these people understand us?
34:06 Will we be able to reach  their heart with these basic truths?’
34:12 Something that helped me not to hesitate
34:14 to approach these people
34:15 despite the language barrier
34:17 is what our teachers told us  in the language class:
34:19 “Go and talk to them.
34:21 “Show them things from the Bible.
34:23 “Even if you don’t say things perfectly,
34:24 they will understand you.”
34:27 After we received permission
34:29 from the branch office,  we also printed thousands of tracts,
34:32 since we did not have enough.
34:35 This whole effort created  an atmosphere of enthusiasm.
34:41 I’m deeply moved when I see how lovingly
34:44 Jehovah cares for these people
34:45 who have never had the opportunity
34:47 to hear the Kingdom message
34:48 that gives them a future and a hope.
34:52 It was exciting
34:54 for them to hear that we have
34:56 a Bible-based video in their language.
35:00 We told them that the problems, calamities,
35:03 and the terrible war they had experienced
35:05 were not punishment from God,
35:07 but the result of the influence
35:09 Satan the Devil exercises  over this system of things.
35:12 And this provided  a good answer to their question.
35:17 On a return visit,
35:19 after two days,  a refugee girl said something very touching:
35:23 “Now I understand why  we have to go through all this.
35:26 It’s very difficult,  but it’s not God’s fault.”
35:29 On another occasion,  Gardinia, a refugee woman
35:32 who showed interest, told us:
35:34 “Since meeting you,  I have a purpose in life.
35:37 “I have a reason to live.
35:39 Until now, I was just waiting to die.”
35:46 A refugee approached  the Arabic witnessing cart,
35:48 and we read Revelation 21:4 to him.
35:51 He said, “Please,  could you read that to me once again?”
35:54 So we read it a second time.
35:56 He replied,
35:57 “May I have a Bible of my own?”
35:59 So we gave him a Bible.
36:01 Then he said,  “Would you please show me
36:02 the sentence you read in my Bible?”
36:05 So we marked the verse for him.
36:07 And on the way back
36:09 to our home at about 11 o’clock at night,
36:11 on the same road, at a well-lit point,
36:13 we saw that same refugee
36:15 sitting on the sidewalk reading the Bible.
36:19 About two and a half years ago,  I met Moustafa.
36:23 He attended the meetings  and made speedy progress.
36:26 Moustafa was baptized a few months
36:28 before the refugees started pouring in.
36:30 We do not believe  that this was a coincidence.
36:33 He would say,  “I want to speak about Jehovah,
36:36 but I can’t do that  in the Greek language.”
36:39 When I can speak to people who are refugees
36:42 —just as I am a refugee—
36:44 in my own language,
36:46 this is a great opportunity for me.
36:50 And when I see that they listen  to the truth and are loving it,
36:54 it makes my heart beat faster.
36:56 It touches my heart.
36:58 By expanding my ministry,
37:00 I’m sharing in a form of service
37:02 that could even be described  as missionary work,
37:04 since I’m helping  people hear about Jehovah
37:07 for the very first time.
37:09 I’m living what I have only read  about in experiences.
37:15 Many were —perhaps for the first time—
37:17 discovering new skills in themselves,
37:21 indicating how Jehovah  through his spirit can enable certain ones
37:25 to cultivate qualities they didn’t realize  they had to such an extent.
37:33 We are so grateful to Jehovah  for opening a door
37:35 leading to such wonderful activity.
37:37 It gives us great joy,  and we praise him daily for this.
37:45 At the time this report was prepared,
37:47 over 100 Bible studies had been started.
37:50 One refugee told the brothers:
37:53 “You are the best thing  that has happened to us here in Greece.
37:57 We thank Jehovah for meeting you.”
37:59 Another said:  “We do not need material things.
38:03 “We need hope,
38:04 and you are giving this  to us through the Bible.”
38:08 In our program, we have been discussing
38:10 how Jehovah values each one of us,
38:13 no matter what our circumstances are.
38:16 In some parts of the world,
38:18 our brothers and sisters  are in deep poverty
38:20 and lack even the basic needs for life.
38:24 But this does not diminish  Jehovah’s feelings for them.
38:27 He loves them dearly.
38:30 In this next report,
38:32 see what’s been done  to care for faithful brothers and sisters
38:36 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
38:45 My name is Maska Mahamba.
38:48 I love the preaching work.
38:50 However, my various illnesses
38:52 prevent me from giving  my all in the ministry.
38:57 My first wife died,  and we had six children.
39:04 I was alone with the six children,
39:06 and then I married Beatrice,  who has five children.
39:13 Since we are living in the last days  of this system, it is not easy.
39:20 I like the example of Jesus,
39:22 who was passionate about preaching  the message that he shared.
39:26 At the same time,
39:28 he took into account  the suffering of the people of his time.
39:31 He would take time to show kindness,
39:34 to encourage, and to heal.
39:38 The branch sees where there is a need
39:40 and then organizes a humanitarian mission.
39:46 I believe I can use my medical skills
39:49 to help our brothers.
39:52 It is love,
39:54 not just in writing,
39:56 but in action.
39:58 It’s a real joy
40:00 to help these brothers who need us
40:01 in remote locations far from towns.
40:04 It is always a pleasure.
40:42 Well, the two are the same;  both eardrums are completely perforated.
41:08 Well, we are here
41:10 in the village of Walikale in the middle
41:12 of the forest on the main road
41:14 —well, the only road in the village.
41:16 It serves as our runway.
41:18 I can’t bear to see anyone suffer,
41:23 so I use all my skills to try
41:25 to find a solution.
41:28 What moves me to help the brothers
41:30 is what Jesus said,
41:32 that “there is more happiness in giving than
41:35 . . . in receiving.”
41:37 A long day —really very tiring—
41:39 but at the same time,
41:41 there was an encouraging case:
41:42 Brother Munyakaragwe, 68 years old,
41:46 10 years in the regular pioneer service,  and he has 15 Bible studies.
41:50 This brother came  from the territory on a motorcycle.
41:53 It took him two and a half hours  on a very rough road
41:57 instead of an hour and a half
41:59 because he has a paralyzed leg.
42:02 And he was able to go  back to his field service,
42:04 well, with some medication.
42:06 So it was really encouraging to see him
42:08 getting on the motorcycle  with a smile on his face.
42:22 These are mosquito nets for those in need,
42:25 and there’s a big need here.
42:26 So we give them to each family.
42:31 You know, to protect your baby,  one of the best things is for him
42:34 to sleep under a mosquito net.
42:38 Jehovah has done well because he has gone
42:40 through you to provide us with care.
42:42 We are very grateful.
42:44 We thank the many brothers
42:46 who have volunteered to serve us.
42:48 I thank Jehovah because without him
42:51 our identifying mark of unity wouldn’t exist.
42:55 You have helped me.
42:57 I had this problem for two years.
42:59 Now I’m so happy.
43:00 I will be able to hear at the meetings again.
43:03 Thank you.
43:04 The brothers are aware  that they must thank Jehovah,
43:07 and we ourselves are aware
43:09 that all of this is possible
43:11 thanks to Jehovah’s holy spirit
43:12 and his organization.
43:42 How heartwarming!
43:44 Those dear ones are not defined  by their circumstances.
43:48 They have been serving Jehovah  whole-souled despite their challenges,
43:52 and they’re determined  to use the relief assistance
43:56 to continue worshipping him.
43:59 Earlier, we discussed  the examples of King David
44:03 and the apostle Paul  and the mistakes they made.
44:06 Perhaps for us,
44:08 our past mistakes are keeping us  from moving forward.
44:12 That was the challenge for Jim Loyd.
44:14 He was raised in the truth
44:17 but did not progress to baptism.
44:19 By his teen years,  he was getting into trouble.
44:22 As he describes it,  in his heart he had left Jehovah.
44:26 His later involvement  with gangs and violence
44:29 put him in a place  he never expected to be.
44:32 But you will be greatly encouraged
44:35 to see where he is now.
44:38 Things that have happened to you,  you can’t change
44:41 —but your personality you can.
44:44 We can change our personality  with Jehovah’s help.
44:47 By the time I was 25,
44:49 I was associating with notorious criminals.
44:52 I guess I was a criminal too
44:55 —just took a wrong turn and kept going.
44:57 I found myself a fugitive on the run.
45:03 I was sentenced to many years in prison.
45:07 At 25, I felt like it might as well  have been a life sentence.
45:11 Isolation and lockdown
45:15 was a very lonely place,
45:17 and I thought,  ‘How did I get here?’
45:22 I remember a happier time in my life.
45:25 My mom would take us to meetings.
45:27 I was in the Theocratic Ministry School.
45:31 All the friends were so loving.
45:35 My mom sent me subscriptions  to The Watchtower and Awake!
45:39 I had a box under my bunk,
45:42 and I’d toss them in there
45:46 —never opened them.
45:48 And I must have had a years’ worth.
45:50 You know, I never told her:
45:52 “Stop sending them, Mom.
45:54 I’m not reading them.”
45:57 I found out through my mom
45:59 that my dad had died.
46:04 I felt that I broke his heart.
46:10 I pulled out the box from under my bunk.
46:13 Right on top was a book,
46:16 The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.
46:20 And at that moment, I knew
46:23 Jehovah hadn’t forgotten me.
46:27 I remembered that book.
46:29 I remembered that book when I was a boy.
46:32 I placed that book out in service.
46:36 I opened it up.
46:38 And, of course, the theme scripture  for that publication
46:41 was Revelation 21:3, 4:
46:44 “The tent of God is with mankind.”
46:47 I read it that night the whole night.
46:50 I read the whole book.
46:51 Of course, that little bell went off.
46:53 I couldn’t deny that this was the truth.
46:55 So what was I going to do about it?
47:00 Shortly after that, I got transferred,
47:02 so I called my mom and told her.
47:04 It was funny; she asked,
47:05 “Do you think there are any Jehovah’s Witnesses
47:07 that go up there?”
47:09 I told her: “I don’t think so.
47:11 “It’s way up in the mountains.
47:12 I don’t think they go up there;  it’s a little fire camp.”
47:17 I wasn’t a spiritual person yet.
47:19 All the magazines and books
47:22 went back into the box  and back under my bunk.
47:29 I’d only been there five minutes,
47:31 and a guard came in and said,
47:33 “Are you a Jehovah’s Witness?”
47:35 I couldn’t believe it.
47:37 And I told him, “I studied with,  been studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
47:41 And he said:  “Oh, good. Follow me.”
47:44 And I followed him,  and he took me
47:46 and introduced me to a brother
47:49 who had been coming up  there regularly
47:52 to study the Bible  with inmates there.
47:55 And I realized
47:57 at that moment that once again
47:59 Jehovah had not forgotten me.
48:04 That brother faithfully came up there
48:07 for the next two years  every Friday night.
48:11 He thought that it’d be  a good idea to have
48:14 a Theocratic Ministry School,  so he got it approved.
48:16 He would do the number one talk,
48:18 and the other brother  that would come with him
48:20 would do the highlights, and then the three of us inmates
48:23 would do the other parts.
48:25 I was giving a talk every week.
48:28 And he started making
48:30 tape recordings of the meetings.
48:32 I’d listen to them over and over,
48:34 until the next week.
48:37 I knew that if I was going  to return to Jehovah,
48:40 I had to make some adjustments.
48:43 With Jehovah’s help —I leaned on him more,
48:46 relied on his strength more—
48:48 it was then that I really felt  that I could do this.
48:53 The beard became a goatee,  and then it just became a mustache.
48:57 No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking,
48:59 and I cleaned up my language.
49:02 Then I finally got released,
49:05 got a job as an electrician,
49:07 and was able to get my own place
49:11 and started going to meetings.
49:15 I was listening to the Watchtower,  and different ones were commenting.
49:19 ‘Oh, that’s his wife’
49:21 —one of the brothers  who came up to visit me.
49:24 I kept looking to see,  so I could finally put a face
49:28 to the voices that I’d been listening to.
49:31 I let Jehovah mold me
49:34 into something good.
49:39 There are many blessings  since dedicating my life to Jehovah.
49:43 I’ve been an elder for ten years now.
49:46 One of my sons came into the truth.
49:48 I met my wonderful wife.
49:50 She’s helped me
49:52 to grow spiritually  and to love Jehovah even more.
49:56 One thing I kept praying for and he’s blessed me with is to forgive myself
50:02 —to have a clean conscience  and freeness of speech.
50:06 And he’s done that.
50:11 Jim shares the same joy as so many others
50:15 who return to Jehovah.
50:18 The feelings common  in such real-life experiences
50:21 are what we’ll see depicted  in our music video.
50:24 It’s called I Can Get Back Up.
50:27 It is especially touching  for those of us who have stumbled
50:32 but need encouragement  to move ahead with Jehovah’s help.
50:52 This loneliness I feel inside  is hard to bear.
51:00 Jehovah, I can see where I went wrong.
51:08 Feeling so downhearted,  I need strength to carry on.
51:16 I’m yearning to be back where I belong.
51:23 I remember things you taught me —things I still recall—
51:32 The precious truths found  in your Holy Word.
51:40 That even if I stumble, even if I fall, I can get back up.
51:55 I know the ones who care for me, Who showed their love before,
52:04 Those who love Jehovah from the heart.
52:12 Your word is like a lamp  that lights the way that leads me back.
52:20 The road to life is where I want to be.
52:28 Ev’rywhere I go, ev’rything I see,  reminds me of the truth:
52:35 The end is drawing near.
52:44 So Jehovah, Father,  please hear my prayer tonight
52:52 And help me now,  I’m in my time of need.
53:00 You know that when I stumble  so many times,
53:08 I can get back up.
53:16 I know Jehovah understands;  sometimes I need a helping hand.
53:32 He knows that I am weak  and sees what others cannot see.
53:39 He’s looking for the best in me.
53:47 So I’m going to the hall tonight  to feel the love I lost,
53:56 Back to where I know I belong.
54:04 And even if I stumble,  even if I fall, I will get back up.
54:29 I can get back up.
54:38 What a beautiful reminder  that if we stumble,
54:41 we can get back up!
54:44 Having seen the examples  throughout the program,
54:47 can you confidently answer  the question of our theme,
54:51 “Are You Defined by Your Circumstances?”
54:54 What do you think?
54:56 Remember,  not the way man sees is the way God sees
55:01 —Jehovah sees what the heart is.
55:04 May we work hard to see ourselves as Jehovah does
55:08 and be determined to never give up.
55:11 May we never forget that it is the privilege of bearing Jehovah’s name,
55:16 having a relationship with him,
55:18 and our love for Jehovah that defines us.
55:21 Jehovah is happy  if we give the best that we can.
55:26 So may we do our part
55:28 by not limiting ourselves  due to our circumstances,
55:31 but always look for ways  to give our best to Jehovah.
55:35 You beautiful older ones,
55:38 even those with severe health problems,
55:40 can do much to help  in the great work that’s taking place today.
55:43 Now, you may wonder  what can you do.
55:45 You can pray for your brothers and sisters.
55:47 We need your prayers.
55:49 Pray for the Governing Body.
55:51 Pray for those who are taking the lead.
55:52 Pray for the elders in your congregations.
55:55 Pray for those who  are going through difficult times.
55:59 Do such prayers help  the work of the organization?
56:02 Absolutely!
56:04 James 5:16 tells us
56:07 that ‘a righteous person’s supplication
56:10 has a powerful effect.’
56:12 No matter who we are  and whatever our situation in life,
56:17 may we find joy  in giving what we can for Jehovah.
56:22 And may each one of us  rejoice at the privilege we have
56:26 of being part of what Jehovah  is accomplishing
56:29 in these last days.
56:32 Of course, we share that privilege  with our worldwide brotherhood
56:37 —a part of which we enjoy  seeing each month.
56:40 To conclude this program,
56:42 we visit with our brothers  and sisters in Togo.
56:46 Located in western Africa,
56:49 Togo enjoys  a very pleasant climate year-round.
56:54 The southern coast contains  extensive lagoons with sandy beaches,
56:58 while farther north are  rolling forested hills
57:02 and yellow tinges of savanna land.
57:04 Togo may be one  of the smaller countries in Africa.
57:08 Yet, it is sending up a great shout  of praise to Jehovah.
57:12 In the town of Kpalimé,
57:14 there are 577 of our brothers and sisters,
57:18 56 of whom are pioneers.
57:21 Kpalimé is located  on a scenic woodland plateau.
57:26 Steep hillsides can sometimes  make service a challenge
57:29 but not a deterrent.
57:32 Our faithful brothers and sisters  not only meet this challenge
57:36 but are very zealous  in carrying out their ministry.
57:39 They diligently search out all persons,
57:41 no matter where they are.
57:43 And many honesthearted ones are listening
57:46 to the good news from God’s Word.
57:50 The first congregation in Kpalimé  was formed in 1961.
57:54 Now there are seven  in this small town alone!
57:58 The Kingdom Halls  are very well cared for by the brothers.
58:03 This is the newest Kingdom Hall,
58:05 Kpalimé-Nogo.
58:07 It was just dedicated  in December 2016.
58:11 And here is their Assembly Hall,  constructed in 2008.
58:16 All 577 send you  their love and greetings.
58:21 And we, in turn,  send them our love
58:24 and pray for Jehovah’s strength and blessing
58:27 to be upon each and every one of them.
58:30 From the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
58:33 this is JW Broadcasting!

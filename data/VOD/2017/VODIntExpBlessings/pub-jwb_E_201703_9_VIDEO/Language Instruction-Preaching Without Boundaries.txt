00:01 Have you ever considered  helping out in a foreign-language field?
00:05 Perhaps there is a need  in your local circuit.
00:09 All over the earth,
00:12 the organization  provides language courses
00:16 with the goal of reaching  every nation, tribe, tongue, and people
00:21 with the good news of God’s Word.
00:24 Brother Juan Carlos Chacón
00:28 serves as a special pioneer
00:31 in the rapidly growing Shuar language field
00:34 in Ecuador.
00:37 He was recently asked to attend
00:39 a course at the local branch
00:42 to become a language teacher
00:45 so that he could help  willing publishers
00:48 learn the language.
00:53 [Speaking Shuar]
01:02 It has been said before,
01:06 “This is a language of the Devil”
01:09 —that it should be forgotten.
01:13 It serves no purpose.
01:19 But to Jehovah,
01:23 no nation is insignificant.
01:30 I grew up in an area  of the Ecuadorian jungle
01:32 where there is  a large community
01:34 of Shuar people.
01:40 Like many native languages,
01:42 Shuar is very complex.
01:50 We need many, many workers in the field.
01:52 But if we don’t give them a foundation,
01:54 if we don’t help them  or give them a little push,
01:58 it’s difficult for them to enter this field.
02:03 I received an invitation to attend
02:06 a seminar for language instructors.
02:13 There were 58 students in the class,
02:17 representing 16 different languages  or language groups.
02:32 We are learning  fantastic teaching techniques,
02:34 real techniques that work.
02:42 The instructor told us how humor helps  our minds to create a world of connections,
02:45 which stimulates our brain.
02:57 Yeah, I’m like a small child
02:59 when it comes to drawing.
03:01 I never learned to draw well.
03:05 We draw a scene,
03:07 and starting with our native language
03:09 along with large gestures,
03:12 we act out a dialogue.
03:15 Little by little,
03:17 we convert the scene into the new language.
03:39 What scares me?
03:41 That I’ve never done this before.
03:44 This will be my first time.
03:49 I don’t have any experience  teaching languages.
04:05 Although I felt intimidated by this,
04:07 I knew that with Jehovah  all things are possible.
04:17 Welcome to the first day  of the Shuar language course.
04:38 The techniques they offered us  in the course were like a box of tools
04:42 that we need to study more carefully  and see how to apply them
04:45 in each circumstance.
04:52 When we are in the territory,
04:54 we see how people’s eyes  light up when they learn
04:57 the name of God.
04:59 Just seeing that there is so much need  for them to learn the truth,
05:04 that has motivated us to come here
05:07 and continue serving here.
05:16 Since God has created us,
05:18 we know that he will never abandon us.
05:20 He thinks about us all the time,
05:22 and he loves us very much.
05:25 I didn’t know that before.
05:27 I feel so happy now
05:29 because I can really understand  the Word of God.
05:35 Being in an isolated group far from other congregations,
05:39 my wife and I  have felt every day
05:41 how real Jehovah is.
05:44 Jehovah is now looking
05:46 and giving his attention  to these small places,
05:49 no matter how small they are.
05:52 If people have a good heart  and want to serve Jehovah,
05:56 he will send workers to give the help that is needed.
06:01 And in reality, this moves us  to say to him with all of our heart,
06:05 “Thank you, Jehovah.”

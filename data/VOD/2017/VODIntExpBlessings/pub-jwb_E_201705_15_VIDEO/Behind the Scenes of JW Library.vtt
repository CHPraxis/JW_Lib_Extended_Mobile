WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:03.720
One of the tools that can help us 


00:03.720 --> 00:06.155
to actively search out reminders 


00:06.155 --> 00:08.323
is JW Library. 


00:08.323 --> 00:11.460
This amazing app has been installed 


00:11.460 --> 00:15.165
on over 15 million devices. 


00:15.165 --> 00:17.800
But do you know 
how much work it takes 


00:17.800 --> 00:20.170
to develop and maintain this app? 


00:20.170 --> 00:24.240
Well, we are now going  to look 
behind the scenes 


00:24.240 --> 00:28.343
and meet some of the brothers 
who have either worked on this project 


00:28.343 --> 00:30.780
or helped to organize that work. 


00:30.780 --> 00:33.450
This really is an opportunity to visit 


00:33.450 --> 00:37.520
an area in Bethel 
that you don’t get to see on tour. 


00:37.520 --> 00:41.390
Of course, there are many brothers 
associated with the work. 


00:41.390 --> 00:44.660
But we would like you 
to get to know three 


00:44.660 --> 00:46.730
of these very hard-working brothers, 


00:46.730 --> 00:49.432
and let me introduce them to you. 


00:49.432 --> 00:53.970
First of all, Brother Per Christensen, 
the overseer of MEPS Programming. 


00:53.970 --> 00:55.505
Now, Per, you’ve been in this country 


00:55.505 --> 00:58.273
working in the U.S. Bethel 
for a number of years. 


00:58.273 --> 01:00.543
But where are you from originally?


01:00.543 --> 01:02.478
I was born in Denmark 


01:02.478 --> 01:05.681
and served there in the branch for years.


01:05.682 --> 01:10.052
So when did you and your wife, Berit, 
come to the United States?


01:10.052 --> 01:11.587
In 1994. 


01:11.587 --> 01:14.124
And our first year was in Brooklyn. 


01:14.123 --> 01:16.691
And then we had 18 years in Patterson 


01:16.692 --> 01:19.695
and then back to Brooklyn again 
for three and a half years. 


01:19.695 --> 01:24.033
And now we’re in Warwick 
since November last year.


01:24.033 --> 01:27.070
Well, I know you worked 
in Translation Services for a while 


01:27.070 --> 01:29.138
because, in fact, 
the two of us worked together 


01:29.138 --> 01:30.740
in the same department 
there for a while. 


01:30.740 --> 01:34.243
But what type of work 
have you been involved with 


01:34.243 --> 01:36.411
since you’ve come 
to the United States?


01:36.412 --> 01:40.015
Lots of exciting and challenging jobs. 


01:40.015 --> 01:42.252
Working in Translation Services


01:42.252 --> 01:47.224
—that was training and support 
for our translators worldwide. 


01:47.223 --> 01:49.291
Now in MEPS Programming


01:49.292 --> 01:52.629
—that is all about 
distribution of spiritual food 


01:52.628 --> 01:54.930
to all our brothers and sisters. 


01:54.930 --> 01:59.235
So we have a ton of work 
and a lot of challenges. 


01:59.235 --> 02:01.337
But I’m also working with a lot 


02:01.337 --> 02:04.740
of very, very talented 
brothers and sisters. 


02:04.740 --> 02:09.412
So it’s a lot of fun, 
and it’s great going to work every day.


02:09.412 --> 02:10.980
That’s great to hear, Per. 


02:10.980 --> 02:14.150
In fact, I’m even tempted 
to come back and work with you.


02:14.150 --> 02:15.152
Oh, we would love that.


02:15.152 --> 02:17.154
I think I’d love it too.


02:17.153 --> 02:20.823
Well, let’s turn our attention 
to Brother Alfredo Serna. 


02:20.823 --> 02:23.693
Now, you are the assistant overseer 
of MEPS Programming. 


02:23.693 --> 02:28.396
In fact, you and I worked together 
in Mexico back in 2003. 


02:28.397 --> 02:31.869
Could you tell us a little bit 
about what you were doing at that time?


02:31.868 --> 02:34.103
My last work assignment involved overseeing 


02:34.103 --> 02:36.338
the large Translation Department there. 


02:36.338 --> 02:38.406
It was an amazing privilege to work 


02:38.407 --> 02:42.145
with translators in sign language 
and the indigenous languages, 


02:42.145 --> 02:46.248
a true joy to contribute
to preparing publications 


02:46.248 --> 02:48.316
for those in the minority groups.


02:48.317 --> 02:51.922
So when did you and your wife, Gina, 
come to the United States to work here?


02:51.922 --> 02:55.292
We arrived at Patterson in 2007. 


02:55.292 --> 02:57.294
We have fond memories of that time, 


02:57.293 --> 02:59.495
and it’s something we still treasure.


02:59.495 --> 03:00.297
Very good. 


03:00.297 --> 03:03.365
And now, 
Brother Paul Willies, 


03:03.365 --> 03:06.735
where do you originally come from 
along with your wife, Su-lin, 


03:06.735 --> 03:09.572
and when did you come
to the United States?


03:09.572 --> 03:11.975
Well, we’re both originally 
from South Africa, 


03:11.975 --> 03:13.977
and we served there in Bethel 
for a number of years. 


03:13.977 --> 03:17.147
And then in 2010, 
we were transferred to work 


03:17.147 --> 03:19.749
along with MEPS Programming 
here in the U.S.


03:19.748 --> 03:22.518
So, what type of work 
have you been involved with, 


03:22.518 --> 03:24.520
particularly recently?


03:24.520 --> 03:25.888
Well, most of my time in Bethel 


03:25.888 --> 03:28.190
I’ve been working 
on the Watchtower Translation System, 


03:28.190 --> 03:29.692
or WTS. 


03:29.692 --> 03:31.694
Actually, 
I was working along with Per. 


03:31.693 --> 03:33.528
Per was in headquarters, 
and I was working 


03:33.528 --> 03:36.398
on the programming team 
that we had in South Africa. 


03:36.398 --> 03:38.701
WTS is the program 
that the translators use 


03:38.702 --> 03:40.837
to help organize and manage 
their translation work. 


03:40.837 --> 03:44.440
And then, of course, most recently 
I’ve been working on the mobile apps


03:44.440 --> 03:48.143
—the JW Library app 
and the JW Library Sign Language app.


03:48.143 --> 03:49.311
Very good. 


03:49.312 --> 03:52.049
Well, now all of you work 
in MEPS Programming. 


03:52.048 --> 03:54.650
Per, can you just tell us a little bit? 


03:54.650 --> 03:57.887
We’re familiar with the term MEPS, 
but what really is it?


03:57.887 --> 03:59.889
Well, MEPS stands for 


03:59.888 --> 04:03.525
Multilanguage Electronic Publishing System.


04:03.525 --> 04:04.893
That didn’t help me at all. 


04:04.893 --> 04:06.061
Sorry. 


04:06.062 --> 04:08.665
Can you make it a little bit 
more simple so we can understand?


04:08.665 --> 04:12.968
We make the tools, or the programs, 
that the organization needs 


04:12.968 --> 04:15.438
to make publications 


04:15.438 --> 04:19.000
and have them translated 
into hundreds of languages. 


04:20.008 --> 04:22.645
So I can illustrate it this way:


04:22.645 --> 04:25.382
that we are not making 
the spiritual food, 


04:25.382 --> 04:29.219
but we are building 
a conveyor belt for the spiritual food 


04:29.218 --> 04:31.753
from the faithful and discreet slave 


04:31.753 --> 04:34.123
down to the printing presses 


04:34.123 --> 04:37.193
or to our website 
or to Watchtower Library, 


04:37.193 --> 04:41.296
ONLINE LIBRARY 
or, like in this case, JW Library.


04:41.297 --> 04:42.465
Thanks so much. 


04:42.465 --> 04:44.333
Now, at long last, I do understand 
a bit more 


04:44.333 --> 04:46.335
about what MEPS means. 


04:46.335 --> 04:49.872
Now, as I travel around, 
the brothers and sisters, 


04:49.872 --> 04:52.842
they tell me how much 
they love JW Library. 


04:52.842 --> 04:55.512
But there seems to be no end 


04:55.512 --> 04:58.614
to the suggestions 
for improvements and features


04:58.613 --> 05:01.150
—and long lists of suggestions. 


05:01.150 --> 05:05.287
Can you give us a little bit 
of an idea of what’s involved 


05:05.287 --> 05:09.759
with trying to develop 
a new feature for JW Library?


05:09.758 --> 05:12.961
Yes, the brothers and the sisters 
really love using the app, 


05:12.962 --> 05:16.565
and because of that, 
they’re keen to get many new features. 


05:16.565 --> 05:20.703
Of course, we wish we could just add 
all those new features into the app, 


05:20.703 --> 05:23.773
but the truth is we just can’t.


05:23.773 --> 05:27.276
Yes, adding each new feature 
involves a lot of work. 


05:27.277 --> 05:30.514
And we also need to determine 
whether a feature 


05:30.513 --> 05:32.515
that’s requested is just a “nice to have” 


05:32.515 --> 05:35.618
or is it something 
that’s going to address a real need? 


05:35.618 --> 05:39.355
For example, will it really help an elder 
who is out on a shepherding call 


05:39.355 --> 05:42.525
or maybe a pioneer sister 
who is at the public witnessing carts 


05:42.525 --> 05:45.327
or at her Bible study or return visit? 


05:45.327 --> 05:49.199
Also, very important 
to us is trying to make 


05:49.198 --> 05:52.368
each new feature 
very simple to use . . .


05:52.368 --> 05:53.803
Ah, thanks for doing that.


05:53.803 --> 05:57.473
. . . especially for a first-time user, 
someone who’s never used the app before. 


05:57.473 --> 06:00.041
And then, of course, 
before we start working on anything, 


06:00.042 --> 06:01.910
we always get approval 
from the Governing Body.


06:01.910 --> 06:03.747
Ah, that’s a good thing to do too.


06:03.747 --> 06:06.949
Like one feature 
that many have been asking for 


06:06.948 --> 06:10.520
is the ability 
to add notes into the app. 


06:10.520 --> 06:13.188
And, of course, 
before we start programming it, 


06:13.188 --> 06:16.891
we have to make sure 
that it actually does what is wanted. 


06:16.892 --> 06:19.429
We made a video 
that shows how we go about that.


06:19.428 --> 06:20.061
You have?


06:20.062 --> 06:20.697
Would you like to see it?


06:20.697 --> 06:23.767
Well, of course. 
I’d love to see it!


06:23.767 --> 06:25.267
Hello. 
How are you?


06:25.267 --> 06:26.102
Good, good, good.


06:26.102 --> 06:27.304
Welcome! 
Thanks for coming.


06:27.303 --> 06:28.370
How about yourself? 


06:28.370 --> 06:29.105
Fine, thank you. 
Have a seat. 


06:29.105 --> 06:31.107
All right, so glad you could be here! 


06:31.107 --> 06:32.342
Thank you so much.


06:32.342 --> 06:33.542
Oh, so fancy.


06:33.542 --> 06:36.679
Yeah!
So we get to talk about JW Library today. 


06:36.678 --> 06:39.515
So, what are some ways 
that you use JW Library?


06:39.515 --> 06:42.518
I mean, it’s revolutionized 
going to meetings.


06:42.518 --> 06:43.485
Oh, my.


06:43.485 --> 06:45.722
I go to meetings 
and sometimes I just carry my iPad.


06:45.722 --> 06:47.824
So the fact that you can make 
the text larger. . .


06:47.823 --> 06:50.993
It’s easy to listen 
to the readings right in the app now, 


06:50.993 --> 06:52.695
and so I—I find myself doing that.


06:52.695 --> 06:54.730
So if we were 
to make a notes feature, 


06:54.730 --> 06:57.032
what are some things 
that you’d like to be able to do?


06:57.032 --> 06:59.335
I mean, if you could see 
all your notes without tapping on 


06:59.335 --> 07:01.803
each one that would be great.


07:01.803 --> 07:05.306
And even if you make a note in, 
maybe, your phone 


07:05.307 --> 07:07.977
and it can also be saved in your tablet, 
that would be really nice.


07:07.977 --> 07:08.510
Yeah. 


07:08.510 --> 07:12.080
Well, what if I told you 
that in front of you  


07:12.080 --> 07:15.183
is an early version of JW Library?


07:15.183 --> 07:15.685
Whoa! 
Cool!


07:15.685 --> 07:16.585
Oh, fantastic!


07:16.585 --> 07:17.187
This is it?


07:17.187 --> 07:18.587
With notes—yeah.


07:18.587 --> 07:20.624
Ooh.


07:20.623 --> 07:22.858
So a few months ago, 
the Governing Body 


07:22.858 --> 07:25.126
gave us approval to start working 
on the notes feature. 


07:25.127 --> 07:28.464
We got together as a team, 
and we’ll do, like, these rough sketches, 


07:28.463 --> 07:29.998
and programmers write code. 


07:29.998 --> 07:31.433
But before we release an update, 


07:31.433 --> 07:32.568
we have a group of testers. 


07:32.568 --> 07:35.036
And, you know, they’ll find 
little glitches or bugs or things, 


07:35.037 --> 07:36.939
but they’ll try to work it out 
with the programmers. 


07:36.938 --> 07:40.810
After that, we have 
a pretty stable version of JW Library. 


07:40.810 --> 07:42.712
The goal is to show it to you, 


07:42.712 --> 07:45.782
and you can let us know 
what you think.


07:45.782 --> 07:48.217
So now that you’ve seen 
the new notes feature 


07:48.217 --> 07:49.819
in JW Library, what do you think?


07:49.818 --> 07:54.323
I love that I can tag the personal things 
that I need to work on 


07:54.323 --> 07:56.625
or a comment or a scripture 
that I can encourage someone with. 


07:56.625 --> 07:57.627
This is fantastic!


07:57.627 --> 07:58.527
Yeah. 
It’s great. 


07:58.527 --> 08:02.399
I like that I can find my notes, 
especially using the search feature. 


08:02.398 --> 08:03.165
It’s great!


08:03.165 --> 08:05.467
And it’s really neat 
how my comments— 


08:05.467 --> 08:07.970
I can place it right next 
to the paragraph for meetings, 


08:07.970 --> 08:10.172
and it doesn’t cover the actual text.


08:10.172 --> 08:13.944
The ability to back it up 
so you can restore it to another device, 


08:13.943 --> 08:15.945
that’s going to be really helpful.


08:15.945 --> 08:16.978
I love it!


08:16.978 --> 08:17.946
Amazing!


08:17.947 --> 08:19.115
OK. 
Go ahead.


08:19.115 --> 08:20.950
Yeah. 
Go ahead!


08:20.950 --> 08:22.000
So you’re telling us we can proceed.


08:23.618 --> 08:24.886
That’s fantastic! 


08:24.887 --> 08:27.557
But, brothers, you can’t show us 
something like that 


08:27.557 --> 08:30.694
and not tell us when 
we’re going to get it.


08:30.693 --> 08:32.561
Well, we said on the website 
that it was coming soon.


08:32.562 --> 08:35.430
I know you said that on the website, 
but when?


08:35.430 --> 08:37.200
Is it OK to be more specific than that?


08:37.200 --> 08:38.968
I think that’s why they invited us here.


08:38.968 --> 08:41.070
Paul, let’s hear it.


08:41.070 --> 08:42.705
Well, we’re happy to tell you 
that the notes feature 


08:42.705 --> 08:45.040
in JW Library 
will be coming soon, 


08:45.040 --> 08:49.478
and by soon we mean 
during May of 2017—this month! 


08:49.478 --> 08:53.381
So we can go and check 
the app stores for an update.


08:53.382 --> 08:55.217
Oh, that’s wonderful to hear. 


08:55.217 --> 08:58.087
So all of us will be happy 
to be able to put our own reminders 


08:58.087 --> 09:01.457
right there in the JW Library app. 


09:01.457 --> 09:05.160
Well, I’m looking forward 
to being able to do that as well. 


09:05.160 --> 09:07.128
But now, 
while I’ve got you here, 


09:07.128 --> 09:10.431
we’re not going to let you go 
until we ask this big question: 


09:10.432 --> 09:13.069
What are you working on now? 


09:13.068 --> 09:18.106
In other words, what can we expect 
to see soon with JW Library?


09:18.107 --> 09:21.077
We have another brief video showing 
what the team is working on 


09:21.077 --> 09:24.547
to support the Study Bible 
on the JW Library app. 


09:24.547 --> 09:25.347
Would you like to see it?


09:25.347 --> 09:27.000
That’s wonderful. 
Let’s have a look.


09:29.185 --> 09:30.452
Later this year, 


09:30.452 --> 09:33.189
work will begin on adding
the Study Edition


09:33.188 --> 09:36.058
of the New World Translation
to JW Library. 


09:36.058 --> 09:37.860
When this edition becomes available


09:37.860 --> 09:39.095
in your language, 


09:39.095 --> 09:40.697
you will be able to discover


09:40.697 --> 09:42.732
spiritual gems in the study notes.


09:42.732 --> 09:44.534
And the new media gallery 


09:44.533 --> 09:47.536
will help you
to visualize the people, places, 


09:47.537 --> 09:49.139
and things you read about. 


09:49.138 --> 09:52.206
You will also see
the new overviews of each book, 


09:52.207 --> 09:53.875
play the introductory videos, 


09:53.875 --> 09:56.578
and study additional appendix material.


09:56.578 --> 09:57.980
All of this and more


09:57.980 --> 10:00.000
is coming soon to JW Library!


10:01.983 --> 10:04.720
That sounds so exciting. 


10:04.720 --> 10:06.722
So we’ll all look forward 
to getting that feature. 


10:06.722 --> 10:09.692
You said, “coming soon,” didn’t you? 


10:09.692 --> 10:12.094
Anyway, 
we’d like to thank you very much 


10:12.093 --> 10:15.463
for the fact that you’ve come along 
and you’ve explained so much to us 


10:15.463 --> 10:18.566
about what goes on 
with MEPS Programming 


10:18.567 --> 10:20.637
and the JW Library app. 


10:20.637 --> 10:22.472
But before you go, 


10:22.472 --> 10:25.675
we’d like to ask you, 
when you go back to your department, 


10:25.675 --> 10:28.877
please, take an expression 
of our appreciation 


10:28.877 --> 10:31.380
back to the hard-working 
brothers and sisters 


10:31.380 --> 10:35.017
who are working behind the scenes 
in providing this tool for us.


10:35.017 --> 10:35.685
Will do.


10:35.685 --> 10:36.318
Happy to.


10:36.318 --> 10:36.618
Thanks.


10:36.618 --> 10:43.876
Thank you very much.

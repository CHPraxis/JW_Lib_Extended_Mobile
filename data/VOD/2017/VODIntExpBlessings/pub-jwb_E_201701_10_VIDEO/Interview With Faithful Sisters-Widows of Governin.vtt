00:19.668 --> 00:24.006
Well, today we have 
the very great privilege to get acquainted 


00:24.007 --> 00:27.877
with five faithful Christian women 
who share something unique. 


00:27.877 --> 00:31.715
Each one was married 
to a member of the Governing Body 


00:31.715 --> 00:34.817
who has now gone on 
to his heavenly reward.


00:34.817 --> 00:38.822
There are nine such dear, 
faithful sisters with us at Bethel. 


00:38.822 --> 00:43.159
Sisters Lucille Henschel, 
Audrey Hyde, Margareta Klein, 


00:43.158 --> 00:46.395
and Charlotte Schroeder could not be 
with us today for this interview, 


00:46.395 --> 00:49.165
but we treasure 
their faithful example as well.


00:49.165 --> 00:51.067
Now, these sisters 


00:51.067 --> 00:53.135
had a very demanding schedule 


00:53.135 --> 00:55.438
while supporting 
their husbands in their work. 


00:55.438 --> 00:58.508
But what were some 
of the blessings that they enjoyed? 


00:58.508 --> 00:59.975
Let’s find out. 


00:59.975 --> 01:03.078
So let’s begin 
with Sister Sydney Barber. 


01:03.078 --> 01:07.450
Sister Barber, could you tell us how you 
began in the full-time ministry?


01:07.450 --> 01:11.653
Well, I was blessed to have parents 
who were faithful and diligent, 


01:11.653 --> 01:13.656
and they raised me with the idea 


01:13.657 --> 01:16.760
that full-time service was to be my career. 


01:16.760 --> 01:19.095
However, when I got out of school, 


01:19.095 --> 01:22.765
I was offered a pretty good job 
that I really enjoyed. 


01:22.765 --> 01:26.435
I took it and then thought about 


01:26.435 --> 01:29.772
what reasons could I give to Jehovah 


01:29.772 --> 01:33.309
why I was working full-time 
and not pioneering. 


01:33.308 --> 01:35.811
Well, of course, 
I couldn’t come up with any reasons. 


01:35.812 --> 01:39.082
And so I knew I had to quit this job, 
which I did. 


01:39.082 --> 01:42.785
And five years later, 
I was invited to Gilead, 


01:42.785 --> 01:45.988
and that’s where I met my husband.


01:45.988 --> 01:48.825
All right, so we understand 
it was in 1956 


01:48.825 --> 01:50.993
that you married Brother Carey Barber. 


01:50.993 --> 01:54.000
Can you tell us a little bit about some 
of his outstanding qualities?


01:55.365 --> 01:57.500
Well, the first thing 
that attracted me to him 


01:57.500 --> 02:01.872
was that he already had a long history 
in the full-time service. 


02:01.872 --> 02:04.507
He had gone to Bethel in 1923, 


02:04.507 --> 02:07.644
some 30 years before that. 


02:07.643 --> 02:11.346
So I knew if I was going to marry, 


02:11.347 --> 02:15.152
I had to marry someone 
with the same goal of full-time service. 


02:15.152 --> 02:17.720
And, then, he was easygoing; 


02:17.720 --> 02:20.923
he didn’t get easily excited 
 or upset about things. 


02:20.923 --> 02:23.325
He had a marvelous sense of humor. 


02:23.325 --> 02:26.728
And all of this helped me a great deal 


02:26.728 --> 02:29.398
because the very day 
after we were married, 


02:29.398 --> 02:31.766
we started in the circuit work. 


02:31.767 --> 02:36.005
And then for the next 22 years, 
I lived out of a suitcase


02:36.005 --> 02:39.208
—lived in the homes of the brothers 
and moved every week.


02:39.208 --> 02:40.910
Wonderful. 
Wow!


02:40.910 --> 02:43.813
That sounds like a demanding schedule, 
Sister Barber. 


02:43.813 --> 02:45.815
But, of course, there were blessings. 


02:45.815 --> 02:46.548
What were some of those?


02:46.548 --> 02:47.550
Oh, there were many blessings, 


02:47.550 --> 02:51.087
although at times I did feel 
very sorry for myself. 


02:51.087 --> 02:56.092
But the blessings and the happiness


02:56.092 --> 03:00.129
—the joys—
far outweighed any difficulties. 


03:00.128 --> 03:05.133
One of the joys was 
to find interested people in the service, 


03:05.133 --> 03:09.471
and then find years later 
that whole extended families 


03:09.472 --> 03:14.044
had come into the truth 
from that person that I’d contacted. 


03:14.043 --> 03:18.681
Then when we came to Bethel, 
we did more international travel. 


03:18.682 --> 03:21.985
Now, often we went 
to maybe an exotic country, 


03:21.985 --> 03:26.155
but we only saw the road from the airport 
to the branch and back again. 


03:26.155 --> 03:31.160
And we didn’t see the tourist attractions 
that most people would go to see. 


03:31.160 --> 03:34.797
But we did see “the desirable things,” 


03:34.797 --> 03:38.902
‘the precious things of the nations,’ 
and that is Jehovah’s people. 


03:38.902 --> 03:43.574
It was such a thrill to go 
to a country like Myanmar 


03:43.573 --> 03:47.210
and there meet, perhaps, 
sisters from the Chin Hills


03:47.210 --> 03:51.447
—little sisters that had learned the truth 
back in their own language, 


03:51.447 --> 03:54.250
way out in the sticks, 
you might say—


03:54.250 --> 03:58.722
or to go to the Andes 
and meet a little Quechua-speaking brother 


03:58.722 --> 04:01.824
and to know that 
these are part of our family 


04:01.823 --> 04:03.860
and that they’re worshipping Jehovah. 


04:03.860 --> 04:06.695
It’s always been dear to my heart.


04:06.695 --> 04:08.932
Very nice.


04:08.932 --> 04:11.300
Well, now, Sister Barber, 
as you look back, 


04:11.300 --> 04:14.203
what is it that you especially treasure?


04:14.203 --> 04:17.540
Well, I’m very thankful that I was married 


04:17.540 --> 04:19.642
to one of Christ’s brothers. 


04:19.642 --> 04:24.280
Just to hear his expressions 
on spiritual matters 


04:24.280 --> 04:28.017
and to hear his appreciation 


04:28.017 --> 04:30.185
for his service to Jehovah. 


04:30.185 --> 04:32.188
He was a humble man, 


04:32.188 --> 04:34.556
and he didn’t speak publicly 


04:34.557 --> 04:37.660
about being one of the anointed; 


04:37.660 --> 04:42.632
but privately he expressed 
great awe of that calling 


04:42.632 --> 04:45.067
and great appreciation for it. 


04:45.067 --> 04:48.672
So I’m very thankful that I was able 


04:48.672 --> 04:52.442
to have 51 years of marriage with him.


04:52.442 --> 04:55.000
Thank you so much, Sister Barber.


05:04.287 --> 05:05.789
Well, next on our program 


05:05.788 --> 05:08.356
is dear Sister Melba Barry. 


05:08.357 --> 05:10.394
Sister Barry, 
we’d like to know a little bit 


05:10.393 --> 05:12.595
about how you 
came into the truth 


05:12.595 --> 05:15.000
and how you started 
full-time service, please.


05:16.265 --> 05:20.035
Well, I’m an Australian lassie, 
born and raised in Australia. 


05:20.035 --> 05:24.773
Way down there, in 1935, 
my mother accepted the truth, 


05:24.773 --> 05:29.378
and the brother was going 
from door to door when he met her. 


05:29.378 --> 05:31.646
Being the oldest of three girls, 


05:31.647 --> 05:33.649
I happened to be the only one 


05:33.648 --> 05:36.018
that showed any interest 
and accepted the truth, 


05:36.018 --> 05:39.688
and I was baptized in 1939. 


05:39.688 --> 05:43.425
But in the small local congregation
where I served, 


05:43.425 --> 05:46.195
I was appointed as the company servant, 


05:46.195 --> 05:51.000
since no qualified brothers were available. 


05:52.102 --> 05:54.737
Brothers were assigned from Bethel 


05:54.737 --> 05:57.740
to give talks in the congregation. 


05:57.740 --> 05:59.908
And so one brother came 


05:59.908 --> 06:02.878
to the congregation 
for such an assignment, 


06:02.878 --> 06:05.180
and when he returned to Bethel, 


06:05.180 --> 06:08.952
he told his buddy 
Lloyd Barry to come out 


06:08.952 --> 06:12.000
to the congregation to give a talk 
and to look me over. 


06:15.323 --> 06:17.126
Eventually, he came. 


06:17.127 --> 06:20.195
Meanwhile, I applied to be a pioneer 


06:20.195 --> 06:24.900
but was accepted to Bethel 
in Sydney in September 1939. 


06:24.900 --> 06:28.303
So I began my 72 years 
of full-time service.


06:28.303 --> 06:31.206
Beautiful. 


06:31.207 --> 06:35.010
Well, then in 1942, you married 
that brother who came to check you out. 


06:35.010 --> 06:38.848
What were some of his 
outstanding qualities, Sister Barry?


06:38.848 --> 06:42.451
Well, he truly loved Jehovah 
and the brothers. 


06:42.452 --> 06:44.120
He was serious. 


06:44.120 --> 06:46.588
He had a kind 
and courageous spiritual manner. 


06:46.588 --> 06:48.791
I thought a spiritual giant, 


06:48.792 --> 06:52.295
since I was such 
an immature person at that time. 


06:52.295 --> 06:56.032
And I thought I needed someone 
to help me get through Armageddon. 


06:56.032 --> 06:59.635
It was so close at that time. 


06:59.635 --> 07:02.472
And Lloyd was a very decisive person, 


07:02.472 --> 07:06.375
and when he learned the truth 
in his teenage years, 


07:06.375 --> 07:08.778
he came to appreciate that serving Jehovah 


07:08.778 --> 07:12.046
is a course to lifelong success. 


07:12.047 --> 07:16.952
And so he began full-time service 
to Jehovah in January 1939. 


07:16.952 --> 07:19.789
He made it the center of his life. 


07:19.788 --> 07:21.990
I liked that about him and, 
of course, 


07:21.990 --> 07:24.000
he was handsome; 
he was the best!


07:25.995 --> 07:27.997
Now, Sister Barry, of course, 


07:27.997 --> 07:30.399
you had this same very demanding schedule, 


07:30.398 --> 07:33.000
but what were some of the blessings?


07:34.070 --> 07:37.407
A Christian wife must be 
in submission to her husband. 


07:37.407 --> 07:40.977
And when he’s busy in theocratic activities, 


07:40.977 --> 07:43.880
she also has to be flexible. 


07:43.880 --> 07:48.852
For example, we were called 
to the 11th class of Gilead in 1948 


07:48.852 --> 07:51.820
and were assigned to Japan. 


07:51.820 --> 07:54.890
During our very first month in Japan, 


07:54.890 --> 07:58.293
Lloyd and I were assigned 
to separate congregations 


07:58.293 --> 08:01.296
in opposite parts of the city of Kobe. 


08:01.297 --> 08:04.734
We had so few publishers 
that we all spread out, 


08:04.733 --> 08:08.536
each going our separate ways 
to get the territory worked. 


08:08.537 --> 08:11.540
When we arrived, there were 
just three Japanese Witnesses 


08:11.540 --> 08:13.542
in the whole country, 


08:13.542 --> 08:18.080
our language was very limited, 
and hardly anyone understood English. 


08:18.080 --> 08:20.082
But Jehovah blessed our efforts. 


08:20.082 --> 08:23.352
In fact, one woman I met 
on my first day preaching, 


08:23.352 --> 08:26.122
she accepted the truth 
and served Jehovah faithfully 


08:26.122 --> 08:28.657
for 50 years as a pioneer. 


08:28.657 --> 08:31.827
But in time, 
more missionaries came to help, 


08:31.827 --> 08:35.632
and in about nine years, 
we had 1,000 publishers or so. 


08:35.632 --> 08:40.235
In 1975, 
we were up to 33,000 publishers, 


08:40.235 --> 08:44.340
but in 1995, 
over 200,000. 


08:44.340 --> 08:46.375
That was a rich blessing.


08:46.375 --> 08:48.277
A wonderful blessing. 


08:48.277 --> 08:50.714
Well, Sister Barry, 
as you look back, 


08:50.713 --> 08:54.450
is there a memory 
that you especially treasure?


08:54.450 --> 08:57.253
Yes, there is one 
that touched me very much. 


08:57.253 --> 09:00.288
For the last 24 years of his life, 


09:00.288 --> 09:04.093
Lloyd was used extensively 
for conventions and zone work. 


09:04.093 --> 09:08.363
And in that time, 
we traveled together to some 80 countries. 


09:08.363 --> 09:10.666
One highlight that I especially treasure 


09:10.667 --> 09:15.304
is that of the district convention 
in Cuba in 1998. 


09:15.303 --> 09:20.175
After each talk, the dear brothers 
and sisters actually all stood up 


09:20.175 --> 09:24.280
and gave each speaker a standing ovation


09:24.280 --> 09:28.117
—clapping their hands 
vigorously over their heads. 


09:28.117 --> 09:33.122
Such happiness and gratitude 
and joy for Jehovah’s provisions 


09:33.122 --> 09:37.025
left a very lasting impression on me, 
and I’ll never forget it. 


09:37.025 --> 09:42.000
So over the years, we could see 
how Jehovah blessed us in full-time service 


09:43.132 --> 09:45.267
and we found much joy in that. 


09:45.267 --> 09:47.937
So it has been a treasure 
and a great privilege 


09:47.937 --> 09:51.374
to have lived a life of nearly 60 years 


09:51.373 --> 09:55.276
with such a devoted brother 
and a faithful servant of Jehovah 


09:55.277 --> 09:57.914
and another treasure and privilege 


09:57.913 --> 10:01.350
to continue serving Jehovah 
in my advanced age. 


10:01.350 --> 10:03.685
I keep trying with Jehovah’s help.


10:03.685 --> 10:05.587
I think you’re succeeding, Sister Barry. 


10:05.587 --> 10:08.000
Thank you so much.


10:19.968 --> 10:21.970
Next, we have the privilege 


10:21.970 --> 10:24.673
to interview Sister Melita Jaracz. 


10:24.673 --> 10:27.910
Sister Jaracz, we understand 
that you’re from Canada. 


10:27.910 --> 10:31.780
So please tell us
about your early days in the truth there.


10:31.780 --> 10:34.983
Well, I was six years old 
when my parents learned the truth 


10:34.983 --> 10:37.720
after they read the booklet 
Where Are the Dead? 


10:37.720 --> 10:41.423
Reading that booklet was all 
that it took my mother and dad 


10:41.423 --> 10:44.460
to learn the truth
about what happened to their first son, 


10:44.460 --> 10:47.463
who had died in the hospital. 


10:47.463 --> 10:51.066
And my relatives were fiercely opposed 


10:51.067 --> 10:54.604
to my parents becoming Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


10:54.603 --> 10:57.740
However, they did not waver. 


10:57.740 --> 11:01.210
We left Saskatchewan 
to go to British Columbia. 


11:01.210 --> 11:03.578
And that was when us children, 


11:03.578 --> 11:08.250
we had the wonderful opportunity 
to participate in the meetings in English 


11:08.250 --> 11:11.587
and also go out in service 


11:11.587 --> 11:15.524
and comment at the meetings
—making comments at the meetings. 


11:15.523 --> 11:18.693
But all of a sudden, no meetings 


11:18.693 --> 11:22.465
and no service
—house-to-house work. 


11:22.465 --> 11:26.268
The ban came on, 
and we were still young. 


11:26.268 --> 11:29.805
So immediately, 
announcements were made, 


11:29.805 --> 11:32.508
“We’re going to go from door to door,” 


11:32.508 --> 11:34.843
and they paused, 
and they said, 


11:34.843 --> 11:37.746
“but only with the Bible.” 


11:37.747 --> 11:40.315
With us children, 
that was good for us. 


11:40.315 --> 11:43.585
Us young people learned to use 
the Bible from door to door. 


11:43.585 --> 11:46.055
And that was when I really was convinced 


11:46.055 --> 11:48.757
that I wanted to become a pioneer.


11:48.757 --> 11:50.459
Fascinating. 


11:50.458 --> 11:55.163
Well, then in 1956, 
you married Brother Theodore Jaracz. 


11:55.163 --> 11:57.733
What were some 
of his outstanding qualities, Sister Jaracz?


11:57.733 --> 12:01.970
Well, he was 13 when he started 
to study the Bible with the family, 


12:01.970 --> 12:04.640
but the family didn’t want 
to continue, so he did. 


12:04.640 --> 12:08.343
And none of them ever came into the truth
—of his family. 


12:08.343 --> 12:12.080
However, he started pioneering 
when he was 17; 


12:12.080 --> 12:15.183
at 20, he became a special pioneer; 


12:15.183 --> 12:20.121
at 20, he went to Gilead
—was invited to go to Gilead; 


12:20.122 --> 12:23.492
and he was in the traveling work 
when he was 21. 


12:23.492 --> 12:26.429
I was hearing a lot about this Ted Jaracz. 


12:26.428 --> 12:30.431
So he had a fine reputation. 


12:30.432 --> 12:33.235
It didn’t take me long 
to appreciate that his goals 


12:33.235 --> 12:36.238
involved serving Jehovah whole-souled, 


12:36.238 --> 12:38.240
and that was my goal. 


12:38.240 --> 12:40.242
As we got to know each other, 


12:40.242 --> 12:43.645
I learned that Brother Jaracz 
was very dedicated and serious 


12:43.645 --> 12:46.215
in his devotion to serve Jehovah. 


12:46.215 --> 12:49.552
And I appreciated these things, 


12:49.552 --> 12:53.055
and I found out that he was very serious 


12:53.055 --> 12:56.592
in his devotion, very kind, friendly. 


12:56.592 --> 13:00.562
Brothers seemed to be very friendly 
with him and he with them, 


13:00.562 --> 13:04.000
and he became friendly with me. 


13:05.367 --> 13:07.904
I rather appreciated that.


13:07.903 --> 13:09.371
Well, Sister Jaracz . . .


13:09.372 --> 13:11.507
I was very glad to become his wife.


13:11.507 --> 13:13.075
Very good. 


13:13.075 --> 13:16.645
Well, now, you had 
this very, very busy schedule too, 


13:16.645 --> 13:19.182
but what were the blessings?


13:19.182 --> 13:21.917
Well, eight weeks after we were married, 


13:21.917 --> 13:24.520
Brother Knorr assigned us 
to the traveling work, 


13:24.520 --> 13:26.722
starting in Missouri and Arkansas. 


13:26.722 --> 13:29.225
It was a good thing I was a country girl. 


13:29.225 --> 13:33.428
I knew what an outhouse was, 
and we had quite a few of those. 


13:33.428 --> 13:37.098
However, for the next 19 years, 


13:37.098 --> 13:41.270
we lived with friends 
in different homes each week, of course. 


13:41.270 --> 13:45.573
And it was sometimes a little rough, 


13:45.573 --> 13:50.578
but the discomforts weren’t that bad. 


13:50.578 --> 13:53.681
But we had such wonderful experiences 
in the ministry 


13:53.682 --> 13:56.000
that it made up for everything. 


13:57.385 --> 14:02.390
And my husband, in 1974, 
was invited to become 


14:02.390 --> 14:05.427
a member of the Governing Body,  


14:05.427 --> 14:08.297
and so we were going to live in Bethel. 


14:08.297 --> 14:12.167
That was my first home after 19 years, 
and I love it. 


14:12.167 --> 14:15.704
Of course, my husband 
had many demanding schedules, 


14:15.703 --> 14:20.008
but we were always together 
for morning worship, lunch, and dinner. 


14:20.008 --> 14:23.278
And since he often had to work overtime, 


14:23.278 --> 14:28.250
I had much to do as far as 
my spirituality at home 


14:28.250 --> 14:31.687
and as well as duties that I had to perform. 


14:31.687 --> 14:34.957
I kept busy with my spiritual things. 


14:34.957 --> 14:37.660
But we always had time together, 
and I appreciated that. 


14:37.660 --> 14:41.363
In fact, 54 and a half years
—I’m very grateful for.


14:41.363 --> 14:42.865
Beautiful.


14:42.865 --> 14:45.767
So, Sister Jaracz, now as you 
look back through all those years, 


14:45.767 --> 14:48.770
what is it that you especially treasure?


14:48.770 --> 14:51.040
Well, I treasure those 54 and a half years 


14:51.040 --> 14:54.310
for the reason that we 
spent it together serving our living God. 


14:54.310 --> 14:56.445
It was a blessing to take care of 


14:56.445 --> 14:59.648
one of Jehovah’s sons by being a wife to him. 


14:59.648 --> 15:02.116
And, of course, it took 
a “power beyond what is normal” 


15:02.117 --> 15:05.487
to see that I met 
his needs and fulfilled them. 


15:05.487 --> 15:08.290
I also treasure that I had the privilege 


15:08.290 --> 15:12.060
of going with my husband on many zone visits 


15:12.060 --> 15:15.763
and to see the joy that it brought him 


15:15.763 --> 15:17.833
to serve our brothers in many lands, 


15:17.833 --> 15:20.835
especially in the lands under ban


15:20.835 --> 15:25.373
—like, for instance, 
Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. 


15:25.373 --> 15:28.543
Each of these countries was like home to us; 


15:28.543 --> 15:30.645
we were always in a family. 


15:30.645 --> 15:35.383
We just went from the airport 
to the the branch or wherever, 


15:35.383 --> 15:39.588
and we enjoyed having 
that association together. 


15:39.588 --> 15:43.258
So these memories bring me 
much happiness and contentment now. 


15:43.258 --> 15:46.461
And I’m grateful to Jehovah 
for them and thank him 


15:46.462 --> 15:49.030
that he still gives me 
“the power beyond what is normal” 


15:49.030 --> 15:51.100
to continue to serve here in Bethel 


15:51.100 --> 15:54.570
and do what I can that I’m assigned to.


15:54.570 --> 15:56.000
Thank you so much, Sister Jaracz.


16:07.448 --> 16:08.916
Well, next on our program, 


16:08.917 --> 16:11.454
we have Sister Edith Suiter. 


16:11.453 --> 16:13.455
And, Sister Suiter, 
we’d like to know 


16:13.455 --> 16:16.692
how you got started 
in the full-time ministry, please.


16:16.692 --> 16:19.127
Well, I was raised in the truth, 
and my parents always took us 


16:19.127 --> 16:22.264
to all the meetings and the conventions. 


16:22.263 --> 16:26.335
And my father always talked to us 
about the truth at the supper table, 


16:26.335 --> 16:28.337
and we had to be there. 


16:28.337 --> 16:32.407
And as we grew older, we were out 
in service every Saturday and Sunday, 


16:32.407 --> 16:34.477
but service was not easy then 


16:34.477 --> 16:38.280
because the war was on 
and mobs would form. 


16:38.280 --> 16:43.118
And they would run us out of town, 
but they never hurt us. 


16:43.118 --> 16:45.353
I think they were more afraid than we were. 


16:45.353 --> 16:50.158
And at the convention in 1946, 
pioneering was stressed, 


16:50.158 --> 16:53.061
and that’s when I decided, 
“That’s what I want to do.” 


16:53.062 --> 16:57.767
So I started pioneering October 1946.


16:57.767 --> 17:00.235
Now, Sister Suiter, 
we understand that it was 1956 


17:00.235 --> 17:02.237
when you married Brother Grant Suiter. 


17:02.237 --> 17:05.840
Can you tell us about some 
of his outstanding qualities?


17:05.840 --> 17:08.410
Well, he was a very kind, caring person. 


17:08.410 --> 17:12.313
And he was very generous
—always wanting to help someone in need. 


17:12.313 --> 17:16.218
And he began full-time service in 1928. 


17:16.218 --> 17:18.486
He was a very hard worker; 


17:18.487 --> 17:21.857
he was very loyal to Jehovah 
and His organization. 


17:21.857 --> 17:25.494
And he really loved Bethel, as I do. 


17:25.493 --> 17:30.498
And he never complained, and he, too, 
he had a good sense of humor also. 


17:30.498 --> 17:35.000
He was very serious 
about his assignments at Bethel.


17:36.037 --> 17:39.942
Well, now you had this demanding schedule 
as well as the other sisters. 


17:39.942 --> 17:43.112
What were the blessings that you enjoyed?


17:43.112 --> 17:45.980
Well, we had many blessings; 
I had many blessings, of course. 


17:45.980 --> 17:48.583
And I especially enjoyed traveling 


17:48.583 --> 17:51.720
with my husband to different branches 


17:51.720 --> 17:54.188
and to work in the branches 
with the sisters there 


17:54.188 --> 17:58.260
and see how they did the work 
differently in other countries. 


17:58.260 --> 18:03.032
And then in the ministry, 


18:03.032 --> 18:05.467
it was a great joy to me to go out 


18:05.467 --> 18:08.370
in the ministry with the missionaries 


18:08.370 --> 18:11.307
and see how they did the work. 


18:11.307 --> 18:16.312
And I really appreciated 
the work my husband was doing; 


18:16.312 --> 18:18.414
it was for Jehovah. 


18:18.413 --> 18:20.781
And when he was very busy, 


18:20.782 --> 18:25.687
I would find things to do 
that I never had time to do 


18:25.687 --> 18:29.390
because of the busy schedule 
that he had and I had. 


18:29.390 --> 18:31.727
And that kept me very busy too. 


18:31.727 --> 18:33.995
So also, we found— 


18:33.995 --> 18:38.000
But he did find time for me too, 
and I really appreciated that.


18:40.202 --> 18:41.204
That’s very touching. 


18:41.203 --> 18:45.506
Sister Suiter, is there a memory 
that you particularly treasure?


18:45.507 --> 18:48.110
Oh, yes! 
I really enjoyed this one: 


18:48.110 --> 18:51.980
Grant was scheduled to give a talk 


18:51.980 --> 18:55.250
at the Cadiz Prison in Spain, 


18:55.250 --> 18:59.522
where 100 brothers were incarcerated 
for their neutrality, 


18:59.522 --> 19:01.524
but the officials said no. 


19:01.523 --> 19:04.793
But we got there two days early, 


19:04.793 --> 19:07.795
and the brothers said, 
“Well, let’s try it.” 


19:07.795 --> 19:11.098
So we went into the prison as visitors, 


19:11.098 --> 19:14.603
and the brothers had discovered 
in their workshop 


19:14.603 --> 19:18.973
an unused door 
that led into their dormitory. 


19:18.973 --> 19:21.810
It was hidden behind wallpaper. 


19:21.810 --> 19:25.880
So the brothers decided 
to camouflage the door completely 


19:25.880 --> 19:30.618
by covering it 
with a backless cupboard. 


19:30.618 --> 19:33.955
Thus, you could step 
into this cupboard door, 


19:33.955 --> 19:38.327
open the door behind, 
and enter the dormitory. 


19:38.327 --> 19:40.329
And once we were in the prison, 


19:40.328 --> 19:43.931
we were invited to visit the workshop. 


19:43.932 --> 19:48.737
And in this workshop, we stepped 
into the cupboard and through the door. 


19:48.737 --> 19:52.840
And here, there were 100 brothers 
waiting to see him. 


19:52.840 --> 19:55.410
So he was able to give the talk to them. 


19:55.410 --> 19:58.480
They were so excited to have 
a member of the Governing Body 


19:58.480 --> 20:00.482
visit them in prison. 


20:00.482 --> 20:03.752
It was so heartwarming, 
so exciting. 


20:03.752 --> 20:07.924
Well, you know, 
my life in full-time service 


20:07.923 --> 20:09.925
has been a very happy one, 


20:09.925 --> 20:12.260
even though there were hardships 


20:12.260 --> 20:14.597
and there were also challenges. 


20:14.597 --> 20:17.832
And I appreciate so much the privilege 


20:17.832 --> 20:20.502
of having served at Bethel 
with my husband. 


20:20.502 --> 20:22.604
And I still love and I’m happy 


20:22.603 --> 20:25.873
to be at Bethel serving Jehovah.


20:25.873 --> 20:28.000
Thank you so much, Sister Suiter.


20:38.453 --> 20:41.121
So now we have the pleasure 
to get acquainted with Sister Marina Sydlik. 


20:41.122 --> 20:43.925
And, Sister Sydlik, would you tell us 
about how you got started 


20:43.925 --> 20:45.927
in the full-time service?


20:45.927 --> 20:49.464
Well, my parents started studying 
the Bible in the mid-’50’s, 


20:49.463 --> 20:53.735
and my mom gave my sister 
and me our first few studies 


20:53.735 --> 20:58.207
in the “Let God Be True” book 
in the kitchen/dining room of our home. 


20:58.207 --> 21:03.000
My first day in field service 
was when I was ten years old, 


21:05.780 --> 21:08.683
on the face of the anointed brother 
that was taking us out. 


21:08.683 --> 21:10.818
He was a special pioneer, 


21:10.818 --> 21:14.588
and it soon became evident to me 
that the happiest people 


21:14.588 --> 21:16.658
are those in the full-time work. 


21:16.658 --> 21:21.330
In time, my dad, my sister, 
and I were all baptized. 


21:21.330 --> 21:26.000
And about ten years after 
our first initial contact with the truth, 


21:27.602 --> 21:30.339
Dan Sydlik started visiting our family. 


21:30.338 --> 21:32.940
And it was due to long conversations 


21:32.940 --> 21:35.943
around our dinner table during his visits 


21:35.943 --> 21:40.381
that my mom saw the beauty of the truth 
and began making it her own. 


21:40.382 --> 21:44.687
I pioneered in later teenage years 
without a partner, 


21:44.687 --> 21:48.624
which meant that after a good call 
there was no one to share the joys with 


21:48.623 --> 21:50.658
except Jehovah, of course. 


21:50.658 --> 21:55.263
And so my relationship with Jehovah 
really blossomed during that time. 


21:55.263 --> 21:58.533
I have some nice memories 
from London Bethel, 


21:58.533 --> 22:02.703
where I waited through 
the immigration process to come to the U.S. 


22:02.703 --> 22:05.573
I sat at Brother and Sister Barr’s table, 


22:05.573 --> 22:07.841
and my London Bethel roommate, 


22:07.842 --> 22:11.747
Joey Orram, and I have kept up 
our friendship to this day. 


22:11.747 --> 22:13.815
We still have a little phone call 


22:13.815 --> 22:17.352
each Saturday morning 
before I leave for field service.


22:17.352 --> 22:18.487
That’s wonderful! 


22:18.487 --> 22:20.789
Well, we understand, now, in 1970, 


22:20.788 --> 22:22.790
you married Brother Daniel Sydlik. 


22:22.790 --> 22:26.027
Can you tell us some 
of his outstanding qualities?


22:26.027 --> 22:29.530
Well, Dan was known 
for his genuine love of people, 


22:29.530 --> 22:32.567
his great love of Jehovah and the truth, 


22:32.567 --> 22:35.204
and his innate love of life. 


22:35.203 --> 22:38.573
That combination really gave me 


22:38.573 --> 22:41.410
a wonderful life to live with him, 


22:41.410 --> 22:45.680
and I have many memories, 
of course, from it. 


22:45.680 --> 22:47.815
But some of the memories 
that I treasure are 


22:47.815 --> 22:50.552
our conversations 
after the supper meal. 


22:50.552 --> 22:54.824
Sometimes we’d sit and talk
about a Bible topic,


22:54.823 --> 22:58.000
and it’s those spiritual conversations 
that I miss to this day.


22:59.728 --> 23:00.695
It’s understandable. 


23:00.695 --> 23:02.730
Now, of course, 
you had a demanding schedule,


23:02.730 --> 23:04.733
but there were blessings.


23:04.733 --> 23:06.333
What were those, Sister Sydlik?


23:06.333 --> 23:08.336
Yes, the schedule was demanding, 


23:08.337 --> 23:10.872
and for a rather reticent person like myself, 


23:10.872 --> 23:14.542
I found the crowds 
and the attention overwhelming. 


23:14.542 --> 23:19.114
But the wonderful friendships we made 
with some brothers and sisters 


23:19.113 --> 23:22.216
around the world 
are what I treasure to this day. 


23:22.217 --> 23:27.189
Now when I think of a country 
like France or Poland or China, 


23:27.188 --> 23:30.591
it’s not the topography 
of the country that comes to mind 


23:30.592 --> 23:34.195
but the faces of the dear brothers there. 


23:34.195 --> 23:36.363
For example, 
in Poland, 


23:36.363 --> 23:38.933
we went there when it was still under ban 


23:38.933 --> 23:41.803
and we visited the brothers in their homes. 


23:41.803 --> 23:45.706
But, then, years later to go back 
and see those same brothers 


23:45.707 --> 23:48.777
in their beautiful new branch 
and Assembly Halls,


23:48.777 --> 23:51.780
well, I was just so happy for them.


23:51.780 --> 23:53.080
Indeed! 


23:53.080 --> 23:56.050
Well, now, as you look back, 
Sister Sydlik, at this rich life, 


23:56.050 --> 23:58.553
is there a memory 
that you particularly treasure 


23:58.553 --> 24:00.555
that you’d like to share with us?


24:00.555 --> 24:04.092
Well, this may be 
an unusual memory to treasure, 


24:04.092 --> 24:07.462
but recalling it now 
may help some other sisters. 


24:07.462 --> 24:09.730
It was when Dan was in hospital


24:09.730 --> 24:13.135
—one of those many days when I was trying
to help him with something—


24:13.135 --> 24:16.370
and he began grumbling, 
almost fighting me. 


24:16.370 --> 24:17.972
So I just said: 


24:17.972 --> 24:21.510
“Babe, I know this has been terribly hard, 


24:21.510 --> 24:25.480
“and you’ve been so brave, 
and you’ve endured so much already. 


24:25.480 --> 24:28.483
But just, please, 
hang in there a bit longer.” 


24:28.483 --> 24:30.485
And immediately he softened. 


24:30.485 --> 24:31.953
He stopped resisting me. 


24:31.953 --> 24:33.955
He never resisted me like that again. 


24:33.955 --> 24:37.358
He just needed that word 
of commendation


24:37.358 --> 24:39.861
and, you know, 


24:39.862 --> 24:43.332
just a little bit of kindness like that, 
approval like that. 


24:43.332 --> 24:47.835
Sisters often give compliments 
to other sisters and receive compliments. 


24:47.835 --> 24:51.640
And it’s just 
a little pleasant moment in the day. 


24:51.640 --> 24:54.575
It buoys us up; 
it’s a little something we share. 


24:54.575 --> 24:58.280
But that’s not the way things 
work among brothers. 


24:58.280 --> 25:00.582
And it may seem that husbands 


25:00.582 --> 25:03.752
who give talks 
and travel for the Society 


25:03.752 --> 25:06.387
get enough compliments and praise, 


25:06.387 --> 25:10.759
but that praise 
is of very limited value to a husband 


25:10.758 --> 25:14.128
compared to a word of approval from his wife


25:14.128 --> 25:16.230
—a word of commendation from his wife. 


25:16.230 --> 25:20.168
And it’s just as Paul said 
about a married man, 


25:20.168 --> 25:23.571
how he’s anxious 
to “gain the approval of his wife.” 


25:23.572 --> 25:27.775
And so without commendation from a wife, 


25:27.775 --> 25:32.780
a husband is missing a little moment 
of being buoyed up, of being appreciated. 


25:32.780 --> 25:36.283
It’s a simple gift a wife 
can give her husband. 


25:36.283 --> 25:38.820
And as we know from James’ words:


25:38.820 --> 25:42.590
‘Every good gift and every perfect present 
comes from above, 


25:42.590 --> 25:45.260
from the Father of celestial lights.’


25:45.260 --> 25:49.000
Yes. Thank you so much, Sister Sydlik, 
for sharing that with us.


26:15.223 --> 26:20.195
Well, how heartwarming 
to learn how each of you 


26:20.195 --> 26:22.863
unselfishly and lovingly supported 


26:22.863 --> 26:25.533
your husbands in Jehovah’s service 


26:25.533 --> 26:29.003
and how richly 
you were blessed for doing so.


26:29.003 --> 26:32.906
Your fine example 
as faithful Christian women 


26:32.907 --> 26:37.179
is a gift to all of us, 
and we thank you so much 


26:37.178 --> 26:54.613
for sharing 
your beautiful memories with us today.

00:07 It’s not easy raising kids in the truth,
00:12 and I had ten.
00:18 I learned the truth when I was 19.
00:22 Some Witnesses came to preach in our town,
00:25 and my father offered them a place to stay.
00:27 He spoke with them all through the night
00:30 and then announced excitedly  that he had found the truth.
00:34 Eventually, I was baptized in the 1950’s.
00:37 My husband was favorable toward the truth
00:40 but got involved  in political affairs in the community,
00:44 and from there  he began his political career.
00:49 When I read 1 Peter 3:1, 2,
00:50 I understood that I needed  to be in subjection to my husband,
00:54 with the hope that he could be won over
00:56 “without a word” by means of my conduct.
00:59 When my children were young,
01:01 I made a weekly Bible study program  for each of them,
01:04 and as they grew up,
01:06 the older kids helped me  with their younger siblings.
01:10 I remember Mom always made  an effort to teach me how to preach.
01:13 I would write presentations  for the ministry on pieces of paper,
01:17 and the kids would practice while they  did their chores around the house.
01:22 We set aside time  one day a week for our family study.
01:26 It could be anything
01:27 —a sack of potatoes,  a sack of flour, or a house plant.
01:31 She would tell me:
01:32 “Imagine that this is a person  you meet in field service.
01:35 What would you say to them?”
01:37 When I finished, she would say to me,
01:39 “The way you did it just now,
01:41 do it like that when you  go out in the ministry.”
01:45 My mom was very creative.
01:49 She would assign us to play  the part of different Bible characters.
01:55 My mom taught us to appreciate the truth
01:59 through her example.
02:01 I served as a regular pioneer for many years,
02:05 and I encouraged my kids  to reach out for spiritual goals.
02:08 My daughter left home at the age of 18
02:11 to serve as a special pioneer.
02:14 Later, my oldest son did the same.
02:16 These two proved to be excellent examples  for their younger brothers.
02:22 Raising my son Noé was a challenge.
02:25 He was the youngest,
02:27 and at a very young age,  he was diagnosed with epilepsy.
02:31 Despite his limitations,
02:33 he was able to serve  as a ministerial servant
02:37 and regular pioneer.
02:38 He fought his illness for more than 40 years,
02:41 before passing away recently.
02:45 Losing my husband in death  dealt me another blow.
02:50 Now my health and my memory are fading.
02:53 I can’t do as much
02:55 in the ministry as before.
02:57 But even so, thanks to the help  of the brothers in the congregation,
03:01 I’m not giving up.
03:06 Even though my husband was not a Witness,
03:09 I respected him as the head of the family.
03:12 I will never forget the moment
03:14 when my husband asked me  to study the Bible with him.
03:18 I remember  that my eldest son gave the talk,
03:21 and his father was  among the candidates for baptism.
03:25 Forty-two years  after I received the Kingdom message,
03:29 my husband was baptized.
03:32 Another great blessing  was seeing my children
03:34 grow in the truth  and use their youth to serve Jehovah.
03:39 Some have served as special pioneers,
03:42 circuit overseers, or in Bethel.
03:45 If it wasn’t for her help
03:47 and the support of my siblings,
03:49 perhaps we wouldn’t be part  of the organization today.
03:53 But thanks to her,  we started out on the best course in life.
04:01 Words cannot express  how grateful I am to her.
04:05 I now find great joy
04:07 in seeing my grandchildren  and great-grandchildren
04:11 follow their parents’ example.
04:13 Thinking about all I have experienced
04:15 in over 60 years of service to Jehovah
04:18 —raising my ten children in the truth,
04:21 my husband becoming a servant of Jehovah,
04:24 and seeing 30 members  of my family in full-time service—
04:28 I can do nothing  but thank Jehovah
04:30 for his blessings.
04:32 It’s been worth all the effort.

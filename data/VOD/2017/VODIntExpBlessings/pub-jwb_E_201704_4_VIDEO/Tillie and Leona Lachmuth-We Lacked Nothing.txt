00:01 We were brought up  in a small town in Saskatchewan.
00:05 It was friendly.
00:07 I don’t think they moved to other places.
00:10 They stayed right there.
00:13 One time, our father said:
00:16 “Why do you have to go so far as India?
00:19 Why can’t you preach in Canada?”
00:24 Dad was very strict.
00:25 Very strict.
00:26 When we were out playing  and he came out and called us,
00:28 we had to come immediately.
00:30 They were strict.
00:31 Don’t question; just do what you’re told.
00:34 Yeah, do what you’re told.
00:35 Yeah.  That’s right.
00:37 Strict.
00:40 My father was the one that was interested,
00:42 but he never came into the truth.
00:44 He enjoyed having Witnesses  come to our home,
00:47 but he never ever thought
00:49 of himself as being  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:53 Coming into the truth, I think,  changed our life,
00:56 and we had a different purpose.
00:59 So that was when we decided,
01:02 “Well, I guess we should pioneer now too.”
01:05 And we only pioneered two years,
01:08 and we were called to Gilead.
01:10 So then we graduated in 1953.
01:13 On your application for Gilead,  one question is:
01:17 Are you willing to go  any place in the world?
01:19 Brother Knorr always would say,  “A one-way ticket.”
01:23 So that was on your mind.
01:26 We were happy to go.
01:27 And if we didn’t get back, that was OK.
01:33 And then the 13 of us, for one month,
01:36 we all went together back to India
01:38 on a ship.
01:39 Well, we were a bit nervous  because we didn’t know
01:42 just what kind of people  we would be meeting
01:45 or what kind of atmosphere  we’d be experiencing.
01:49 That was why it was a shock  when we landed in Bombay
01:52 because all we could see
01:55 was people,  people everywhere and noise.
02:00 And then they gave us such hot food.
02:02 We were burning all the way down.
02:05 And then when we arrived there,  the missionary home had no furniture
02:09 and we had to sleep on the floor  for quite a few months
02:12 before the furniture was made.
02:14 We boiled our water; we filtered our water.
02:16 When we went to the market,  we’d bring all our vegetables and fruit home
02:20 and we washed them with a solution.
02:22 And we were very careful in that respect.
02:24 It was all a shock to us in many things.
02:27 Yes.
02:29 We made up our mind, I guess,
02:31 that it’s not going to be  the same as Canada, we know.
02:33 We didn’t worry about the things  we had to put up with
02:35 because we had the joy in the ministry.
02:38 The Society wanted us  to get the Joy booklet out,
02:42 and we had to just stand on the street  with this carton of literature
02:46 and just keep calling out to the people,
02:48 and everybody would take it.
02:50 And they were so appreciative,  really appreciative.
02:52 Yeah, they were.  Yeah.
02:53 In those days,  we had to put in 150 hours.
02:57 And in South India, after 4:00 p.m.,
03:01 women were not out.
03:02 So we had to get all our time in
03:04 early in the morning  and work right through until four o’clock.
03:08 We sure did.
03:12 We were using the Malayalam language,
03:15 and the children repeated what we said.
03:18 They’d run ahead and tell people
03:20 what we were talking about.
03:23 And they’d all yell,  “Ma’damma, ma’damma.”
03:25 “White woman, white woman.”
03:26 Yeah, and we had many studies then.
03:29 We enjoyed the ministry,  and we enjoyed the hospitality.
03:33 Be with the brothers and go to their homes
03:35 and eat their food and do things  the way they do things.
03:40 So we had to make India our home.
03:43 We lived in India about 50 years.
03:46 And then the news came  that we had to leave.
03:49 So that was why the Governing Body said,
03:51 “Well, you go to the Canada branch then.”
03:54 Well, it was like a culture shock too  after being so many years in India.
03:58 Yes.
03:59 A lot of things we had  to sort of adjust to here now.
04:06 I’m working down in the laundry, folding.
04:08 Same.
04:09 Folding and folding until we fold in.
04:17 Well, we always tell the younger ones
04:19 to be in the full-time service  serving Jehovah.
04:21 This, we think,  is a wonderful life to choose.
04:25 It’s good for the young people  to learn when they’re young like that.
04:29 And, no doubt,  they’ll make progress in the truth too.
04:33 We’re glad we started pioneering  and moved about.
04:36 Yeah.  We lacked nothing, really.
04:38 We have nothing to complain about.

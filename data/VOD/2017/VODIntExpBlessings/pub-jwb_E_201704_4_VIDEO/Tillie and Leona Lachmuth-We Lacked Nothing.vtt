00:01.772 --> 00:05.525
We were brought up 
in a small town in Saskatchewan. 


00:05.525 --> 00:07.528
It was friendly. 


00:07.528 --> 00:10.738
I don’t think they moved to other places. 


00:10.738 --> 00:13.991
They stayed right there. 


00:13.992 --> 00:16.870
One time, our father said: 


00:16.870 --> 00:19.122
“Why do you have to go so far as India? 


00:19.122 --> 00:22.000
Why can’t you preach in Canada?” 


00:24.337 --> 00:25.170
Dad was very strict.


00:25.170 --> 00:26.088
Very strict. 


00:26.088 --> 00:28.548
When we were out playing 
and he came out and called us, 


00:28.548 --> 00:30.425
we had to come immediately.


00:30.425 --> 00:31.718
They were strict.


00:31.718 --> 00:34.888
Don’t question; just do what you’re told.


00:34.888 --> 00:35.513
Yeah, do what you’re told. 


00:35.513 --> 00:36.000
Yeah. 
That’s right. 


00:37.642 --> 00:40.019
Strict. 


00:40.018 --> 00:42.855
My father was the one that was interested, 


00:42.855 --> 00:44.857
but he never came into the truth.


00:44.857 --> 00:47.569
He enjoyed having Witnesses 
come to our home, 


00:47.568 --> 00:49.570
but he never ever thought 


00:49.570 --> 00:52.000
of himself as being 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


00:53.407 --> 00:56.994
Coming into the truth, I think, 
changed our life, 


00:56.993 --> 00:59.830
and we had a different purpose. 


00:59.830 --> 01:02.457
So that was when we decided, 


01:02.457 --> 01:05.335
“Well, I guess we should pioneer now too.” 


01:05.335 --> 01:08.255
And we only pioneered two years, 


01:08.255 --> 01:10.257
and we were called to Gilead. 


01:10.257 --> 01:13.885
So then we graduated in 1953. 


01:13.885 --> 01:17.180
On your application for Gilead, 
one question is: 


01:17.180 --> 01:19.767
Are you willing to go 
any place in the world? 


01:19.767 --> 01:23.270
Brother Knorr always would say, 
“A one-way ticket.” 


01:23.270 --> 01:26.690
So that was on your mind.


01:26.690 --> 01:27.900
We were happy to go. 


01:27.900 --> 01:30.000
And if we didn’t get back, that was OK.


01:33.447 --> 01:36.034
And then the 13 of us, for one month, 


01:36.033 --> 01:38.368
we all went together back to India 


01:38.368 --> 01:39.995
on a ship.


01:39.995 --> 01:42.080
Well, we were a bit nervous 
because we didn’t know 


01:42.080 --> 01:45.000
just what kind of people 
we would be meeting 


01:45.000 --> 01:49.253
or what kind of atmosphere 
we’d be experiencing.


01:49.253 --> 01:52.465
That was why it was a shock 
when we landed in Bombay 


01:52.465 --> 01:55.260
because all we could see 


01:55.260 --> 01:59.000
was people, 
people everywhere and noise.


02:00.098 --> 02:02.516
And then they gave us such hot food. 


02:02.517 --> 02:05.812
We were burning all the way down.


02:05.812 --> 02:09.317
And then when we arrived there, 
the missionary home had no furniture 


02:09.317 --> 02:12.194
and we had to sleep on the floor 
for quite a few months 


02:12.193 --> 02:14.278
before the furniture was made. 


02:14.278 --> 02:16.990
We boiled our water;
we filtered our water.


02:16.990 --> 02:20.577
When we went to the market, 
we’d bring all our vegetables and fruit home 


02:20.577 --> 02:22.579
and we washed them with a solution. 


02:22.578 --> 02:24.790
And we were very careful in that respect.


02:24.790 --> 02:27.333
It was all a shock to us in many things.


02:27.333 --> 02:29.043
Yes. 


02:29.043 --> 02:31.046
We made up our mind, I guess, 


02:31.047 --> 02:33.049
that it’s not going to be 
the same as Canada, we know. 


02:33.048 --> 02:35.925
We didn’t worry about the things 
we had to put up with 


02:35.925 --> 02:38.803
because we had the joy in the ministry. 


02:38.803 --> 02:42.766
The Society wanted us 
to get the Joy booklet out, 


02:42.767 --> 02:46.437
and we had to just stand on the street 
with this carton of literature 


02:46.437 --> 02:48.605
and just keep calling out to the people, 


02:48.605 --> 02:50.607
and everybody would take it.


02:50.607 --> 02:52.609
And they were so appreciative, 
really appreciative.


02:52.608 --> 02:53.735
Yeah, they were. 
Yeah. 


02:53.735 --> 02:57.613
In those days, 
we had to put in 150 hours. 


02:57.613 --> 03:01.118
And in South India, after 4:00 p.m., 


03:01.118 --> 03:02.660
women were not out. 


03:02.660 --> 03:04.747
So we had to get all our time in


03:04.747 --> 03:08.625
early in the morning 
and work right through until four o’clock.


03:08.625 --> 03:11.000
We sure did.


03:12.628 --> 03:15.756
We were using the Malayalam language, 


03:15.757 --> 03:18.510
and the children repeated what we said.


03:18.510 --> 03:20.637
They’d run ahead and tell people 


03:20.637 --> 03:23.057
what we were talking about.


03:23.057 --> 03:25.059
And they’d all yell, 
“Ma’damma, ma’damma.”


03:25.058 --> 03:26.810
“White woman, white woman.”


03:26.810 --> 03:28.000
Yeah, and we had many studies then. 


03:29.605 --> 03:33.400
We enjoyed the ministry, 
and we enjoyed the hospitality.


03:33.400 --> 03:35.693
Be with the brothers and go to their homes 


03:35.693 --> 03:40.615
and eat their food and do things 
the way they do things.


03:40.615 --> 03:43.077
So we had to make India our home. 


03:43.077 --> 03:46.872
We lived in India about 50 years. 


03:46.872 --> 03:49.917
And then the news came 
that we had to leave. 


03:49.917 --> 03:51.919
So that was why the Governing Body said, 


03:51.918 --> 03:54.921
“Well, you go to the Canada branch then.” 


03:54.922 --> 03:58.925
Well, it was like a culture shock too 
after being so many years in India.


03:58.925 --> 03:59.927
Yes.


03:59.927 --> 04:02.000
A lot of things we had 
to sort of adjust to here now. 


04:06.183 --> 04:08.726
I’m working down in the laundry, folding.


04:08.727 --> 04:09.729
Same. 


04:09.728 --> 04:12.000
Folding and folding until we fold in.


04:17.485 --> 04:19.488
Well, we always tell the younger ones 


04:19.488 --> 04:21.490
to be in the full-time service 
serving Jehovah. 


04:21.490 --> 04:25.535
This, we think, 
is a wonderful life to choose.


04:25.535 --> 04:29.080
It’s good for the young people 
to learn when they’re young like that.


04:29.080 --> 04:33.627
And, no doubt, 
they’ll make progress in the truth too.


04:33.627 --> 04:36.880
We’re glad we started pioneering 
and moved about.


04:36.880 --> 04:38.882
Yeah. 
We lacked nothing, really. 


04:38.882 --> 04:51.167
We have nothing to complain about.

00:11.198 --> 00:18.575
At times, I wish I could see 
exactly what my future will be


00:18.575 --> 00:26.000
And how my life will turn out 
and which road is the right one for me.


00:28.382 --> 00:35.000
But one thing’s for sure, 
no matter what comes along,


00:36.615 --> 00:44.440
I live for Jehovah, 
to him I belong.


00:44.440 --> 00:49.832
Of all the people and things 
my life could be filled with,


00:49.832 --> 00:54.482
The best one of all, 
the best one to build with,


00:54.482 --> 01:02.265
Is pleasing Jehovah each day 
with the choices I make.


01:02.265 --> 01:07.465
He gave me all that I have; 
I’ll never forget it.


01:07.465 --> 01:11.848
I’m safe in his hands; 
I’ll never regret it.


01:11.848 --> 01:17.000
I’m building my future with him 
ev’ry step that I take.


01:20.715 --> 01:28.608
At times, the chance comes along 
to take a path I know to be wrong,


01:28.608 --> 01:36.000
A path that leads me away 
from the place that I know I belong.


01:38.082 --> 01:45.000
But keeping in mind 
the dedication I made


01:46.918 --> 01:54.865
Can give me the firmness and faith 
that won’t fade.


01:54.865 --> 01:59.640
Of all the people and things 
my life could be filled with,


01:59.640 --> 02:03.852
The best one of all, 
the best one to build with,


02:03.852 --> 02:12.182
Is pleasing Jehovah each day 
with the choices I make.


02:12.182 --> 02:17.324
He gave me all that I have; 
I’ll never forget it.


02:17.323 --> 02:21.661
I’m safe in his hands; 
I’ll never regret it.


02:21.662 --> 02:29.000
I’m building my future with him 
ev’ry step that I take.


02:30.632 --> 02:34.467
I’m building a future 
that never will end


02:34.467 --> 02:39.032
If I build it with help 
from Jehovah, my Friend.


02:39.032 --> 02:43.142
The happiest moments, 
the best life can give,


02:43.142 --> 02:50.000
Come from pleasing Jehovah 
each day that I live.


03:08.083 --> 03:12.755
Of all the people and things 
my life could be filled with,


03:12.755 --> 03:17.383
The best one of all, 
the best one to build with,


03:17.383 --> 03:25.481
Is pleasing Jehovah each day 
with the choices I make.


03:25.482 --> 03:30.355
He gave me all that I have; 
I’ll never forget it.


03:30.355 --> 03:35.068
I’m safe in his hands; 
I’ll never regret it.


03:35.068 --> 03:41.000
I’m building my future with him 
ev’ry step that I take.


03:47.748 --> 04:04.786
I’m building my future 
with him ev’ry step that I take.

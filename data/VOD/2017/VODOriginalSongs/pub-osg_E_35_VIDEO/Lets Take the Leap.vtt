00:12.157 --> 00:18.997
To serve full-time,
That’s been our goal.


00:18.997 --> 00:25.462
It opens up
More ways to serve whole-souled.


00:25.462 --> 00:31.927
So if not now
And if not here,


00:31.927 --> 00:38.392
This chance might slip away
And disappear.


00:38.392 --> 00:44.774
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


00:44.773 --> 00:51.238
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


00:51.238 --> 00:57.745
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back, not behind.


00:57.745 --> 01:07.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


01:17.347 --> 01:23.187
Jehovah knows;
Jehovah sees.


01:23.187 --> 01:29.902
Before we ask,
He knows the needs of each.


01:29.902 --> 01:36.367
Though it might seem
Beyond our reach,


01:36.367 --> 01:42.665
Let’s put our trust in him
And take the leap.


01:42.665 --> 01:49.045
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


01:49.045 --> 01:55.593
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


01:55.593 --> 02:02.266
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back, not behind.


02:02.267 --> 02:13.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


02:14.988 --> 02:21.203
So let’s go through
This open door.


02:21.203 --> 02:27.918
Things left behind
Will be replaced and more,


02:27.918 --> 02:35.008
Not only now
But all that God has in store—


02:35.008 --> 02:40.680
The life to come
Forevermore.


02:40.680 --> 02:46.603
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


02:46.603 --> 02:53.568
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


02:53.568 --> 03:00.116
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back and not behind.


03:00.117 --> 03:11.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


03:13.005 --> 03:19.302
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


03:19.302 --> 03:25.809
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


03:25.808 --> 03:32.398
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back and not behind.


03:32.398 --> 03:44.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


03:51.418 --> 04:06.663
Let’s take the leap.

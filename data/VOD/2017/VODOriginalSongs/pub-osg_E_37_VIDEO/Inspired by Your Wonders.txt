00:01 I hear the birds singing out to the sunrise.
00:08 I see the stars fading away in the morning light.
00:20 Golden sun shines on down through the treetops,
00:27 Where there is a summer breeze that whispers so soft.
00:37 And I sing, “O Jah, Jehovah my God,
00:41 The work of your hands fills us with awe.”
00:46 I stare at the stars, Wondering how you care who we are.
00:56 I see your wonders, and I sing to you.
01:07 I see your wonders, and I sing to you.
01:15 I sing to you.
01:23 These wondrous, moving, breathing creations—
01:30 Oh, in the night, in the day— can you hear what they say?
01:42 From mountaintops to the bottoms of oceans,
01:49 Let ev’ry living thing sing out to your praise.
01:59 And I sing, “O Jah, Jehovah my God,
02:03 The work of your hands fills us with awe.”
02:08 I stare at the stars, Wondering how you care who we are.
02:17 I see your wonders, and I sing to you.
02:27 I see your wonders,  and I sing to you.
02:37 I sing to you.
02:41 Looking past what we  can see with our eyes,
02:50 We will come to know more  about the One who gave us life.
03:01 And I sing, “O Jah, Jehovah my God,
03:05 The work of your hands fills us with awe.”
03:10 I stare at the stars, Wondering how you care who we are.
03:20 I see your wonders, and I sing to you.
03:29 I see your wonders, and I sing to you.
03:39 I see your wonders, and I—I sing to you.
03:49 I see your wonders, and I—I sing to you.
03:59 I see your wonders, and I—I sing to you.
04:08 I sing to you.

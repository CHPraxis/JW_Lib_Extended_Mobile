00:11.333 --> 00:21.916
Through all her tender years,
He watched her grow.


00:21.917 --> 00:30.800
Many the joys and tears,
She would come to know.


00:30.800 --> 00:35.847
But when she gave her best
And came through each test,


00:35.847 --> 00:41.812
She made His heart feel so good.


00:41.812 --> 00:51.000
Precious daughter, 
He’s so proud of you.


00:54.450 --> 01:03.000
Time won’t alter His love for you.


01:20.267 --> 01:29.000
Hard work and sacrifice—
That’s just her way.


01:30.485 --> 01:38.285
Thinking of His advice
Helps her through the day,


01:38.285 --> 01:43.207
And she’s so glad to know
That He loves her so.


01:43.207 --> 01:48.000
It means so much to hear him say:


01:49.253 --> 01:59.000
“Precious daughter, 
I’m so proud of you.


02:01.558 --> 02:09.000
Time won’t alter my love for you.”


02:23.497 --> 02:28.752
Yes, Jehovah sees
And Jehovah knows


02:28.752 --> 02:33.590
All the work you’ve done
And the love you’ve shown.


02:33.590 --> 02:38.595
No, He won’t forget
How you’ve loved His name


02:38.595 --> 02:42.000
For all this time.


02:44.477 --> 02:54.000
Precious daughter, 
He’s so proud of you.


02:56.697 --> 03:06.000
Precious daughter, 
He’ll be there for you.


03:08.833 --> 03:19.000
Precious daughter, 
He will care for you.


03:21.555 --> 03:58.988
Precious daughter,
He loves you.

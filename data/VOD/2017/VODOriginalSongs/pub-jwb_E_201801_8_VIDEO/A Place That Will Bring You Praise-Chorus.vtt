00:20.165 --> 00:29.800
Jehovah, the Maker of heaven,
By heaven you can’t be contained,


00:29.800 --> 00:40.102
Even less an earthly dwelling place.
But your spirit can here remain.


00:40.102 --> 00:49.362
Adorning this center of worship
Are people who walk in your light.


00:49.362 --> 00:58.329
We rejoice to serve in unity; 
Our devotion is your delight.


00:58.328 --> 01:07.545
There is nothing we have
That you haven’t provided.


01:07.545 --> 01:17.807
From your own hand, we’ve given
All that we offer you.


01:17.807 --> 01:27.149
For all you have done, we are grateful;
Our voices in song we now raise.


01:27.148 --> 01:38.000
For you’ve made our hope reality
With this place that will bring you praise.


01:39.995 --> 01:49.338
Jehovah, you knew that we wanted
A place that will bring to you praise


01:49.338 --> 01:58.471
And will serve the needs of worshippers,
Helping others to walk your ways.


01:58.472 --> 02:08.440
And now may this place serve your purpose.
There’s work needing yet to be done,


02:08.440 --> 02:17.573
To pick up the pace and carry on
In the work given by your Son.


02:17.573 --> 02:27.333
So we offer the best
Of our time and possessions.


02:27.333 --> 02:37.510
You alone are deserving—
Giver of all good things.


02:37.510 --> 02:47.312
For all you have done, we are grateful;
Our voices in song we now raise.


02:47.312 --> 03:15.237
For you’ve made our hope reality
With this place that will bring you praise.

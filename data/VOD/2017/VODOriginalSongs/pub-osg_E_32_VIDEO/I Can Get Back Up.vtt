00:16.828 --> 00:25.420
This loneliness I feel inside 
is hard to bear.


00:25.420 --> 00:32.000
Jehovah, I can see where I went wrong.


00:33.178 --> 00:40.726
Feeling so downhearted, 
I need strength to carry on.


00:40.727 --> 00:47.000
I’m yearning to be back where I belong.


00:48.277 --> 00:56.660
I remember things you taught me
—things I still recall—


00:56.660 --> 01:04.960
The precious truths found 
in your Holy Word.


01:04.960 --> 01:20.433
That even if I stumble, even if I fall,
I can get back up.


01:20.433 --> 01:28.000
I know the ones who care for me,
Who showed their love before,


01:29.067 --> 01:36.700
Those who love Jehovah from the heart.


01:36.700 --> 01:44.000
Your word is like a lamp 
that lights the way that leads me back.


01:45.042 --> 01:53.425
The road to life is where I want to be.


01:53.425 --> 02:00.307
Ev’rywhere I go, ev’rything I see, 
reminds me of the truth:


02:00.307 --> 02:08.649
The end is drawing near.


02:08.648 --> 02:16.990
So Jehovah, Father, 
please hear my prayer tonight


02:16.990 --> 02:24.873
And help me now, 
I’m in my time of need.


02:24.873 --> 02:33.506
You know that when I stumble 
so many times,


02:33.507 --> 02:40.889
I can get back up.


02:40.888 --> 02:55.000
I know Jehovah understands; 
sometimes I need a helping hand.


02:56.822 --> 03:04.414
He knows that I am weak 
and sees what others cannot see.


03:04.413 --> 03:12.295
He’s looking for the best in me.


03:12.295 --> 03:21.138
So I’m going to the hall tonight 
to feel the love I lost,


03:21.138 --> 03:29.186
Back to where I know I belong.


03:29.187 --> 03:45.000
And even if I stumble, 
even if I fall, I will get back up.


03:53.628 --> 04:10.708
I can get back up.

00:08.490 --> 00:16.578
The work of the Kingdom,
in my lifetime and before,


00:16.578 --> 00:25.275
Provides me with your written Word, 
the truth, and so much more.


00:25.275 --> 00:33.470
Your faithful slave, discreet and wise, 
provides increasing light


00:33.470 --> 00:43.915
And sends out men who shepherd me 
with loving oversight.


00:43.915 --> 00:51.675
I know expectations 
at conventions will be met.


00:51.675 --> 01:00.017
And afterward, I always say,
“Now that’s the best one yet!”


01:00.017 --> 01:08.444
At weekly meetings, 
I can feel your thoughtful, loving care


01:08.443 --> 01:19.140
And learn how best to preach and teach 
and have a fuller share.


01:19.140 --> 01:35.398
We marvel at your work
And what the Kingdom’s done so far.


01:35.398 --> 01:43.665
We cherish Kingdom rule.


01:43.665 --> 01:52.090
We grow in faith to realize 
the kind of God you are.


01:52.090 --> 02:04.000
We look ahead to blessings 
that your Kingdom soon will bring.


02:09.023 --> 02:16.698
You give us the honor 
to be workers on your side,


02:16.698 --> 02:25.018
Our ministry that lets us show 
the love we feel inside.


02:25.018 --> 02:33.193
The depth of understanding 
and the peace of mind you give,


02:33.193 --> 02:43.370
They teach us what is pure and true; 
they show the way to live.


02:43.370 --> 02:51.922
The songs that express 
what’s in my heart so very well


02:51.922 --> 02:59.970
And Fam’ly Worship ev’nings 
give your spirit room to dwell.


02:59.970 --> 03:08.873
Our unity, despite whatever language 
we might speak,


03:08.873 --> 03:17.000
Proves that our loving brotherhood 
in this world is unique.


03:18.982 --> 03:34.000
We marvel at your work
And what the Kingdom’s done so far.


03:35.390 --> 03:43.773
We cherish Kingdom rule.


03:43.773 --> 03:51.855
We grow in faith 
to realize the kind of God you are.


03:51.855 --> 04:18.508
We look ahead to blessings 
that your Kingdom soon will bring.

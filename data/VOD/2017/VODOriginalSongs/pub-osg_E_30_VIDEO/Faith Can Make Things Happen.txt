00:11 A heart full of questions,  a life so unsure,
00:17 I heard what you told me;  I wanted more.
00:21 What you told me,  I wanted more.
00:33 Unanswered questions  were answered that day.
00:38 The worry I was feeling  melted away.
00:43 All my worries  faded away.
00:54 It’s a long road we’re going down, But faith can make things happen.
01:04 When there’s no way through  and no way round,
01:10 Faith can make things happen, Make things happen.
01:28 I love what I’m learning  and share what I know.
01:34 I’m ready and waiting,  so here I go.
01:39 Yes, I’m ready To share what I know.
01:50 My faith is like a fire  that burns within my heart.
01:55 I’ve got to keep it burning  and do my part.
02:01 Keep it burning  deep in my heart.
02:11 It’s a long road we’re going down, But this I’ve not forgotten:
02:21 When there’s no way through  and no way round,
02:28 Faith can make things happen, Make things happen.
02:40 Seeing sad days, bad days,  bring stormy weather.
02:51 Praying over and over,  staying close to Jehovah.
03:01 He said, “If you put your trust in me, I’ll give you strength, and then you’ll see
03:07 The trials that came to be, We faced them together.”
03:12 It’s a long road we’re going down, But this I’ve not forgotten:
03:23 When there’s no way through  and no way round,
03:29 Faith can make things happen.
03:34 Now I’m so sure, I have no doubt, Faith can make things happen.
03:44 When there’s no way through  and no way round,
03:50 Faith can make things happen, Make things happen.

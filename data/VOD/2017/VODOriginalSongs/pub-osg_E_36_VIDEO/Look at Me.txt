00:10 Think—think outside the box. Be someone who talks.
00:16 Don’t waste away behind that tiny screen
00:19 ’Cause you know  that there’s much more to life
00:23 Than friend requests and likes. Think of all the things we haven’t seen.
00:29 Well, you—
00:30 You’ll never see them if you’re focused on the superficial.
00:34 You need real friends,  if you know what I mean.
00:38 Look at me. Can you see
00:42 What I see? Around the world, this happy family.
00:47 Look at me. Do you know
00:51 What I know? That you belong.
00:56 Put down the phone, and look at me.
01:02 Take—take the time to see. See what others see.
01:08 Don’t trade that plastic box for all your friends.
01:11 You can make friends you know are true, Who love Jehovah too,
01:17 Who’ll stand right  by your side until the end.
01:21 But, you—
01:22 You’ll never meet them if you’re focused on the superficial.
01:26 You need real friends, if you know what I mean.
01:30 Look at me. Can you see
01:34 What I see? Around the world, this happy family.
01:40 Look at me. Do you know
01:44 What I know? That you belong.
01:48 Put down the phone, and look at me.
02:09 Don’t let it play you for a fool.
02:14 What you’re getting  could be fact or could be fiction.
02:19 Life in the cloud can be so cruel.
02:24 Why don’t you come back down to earth, converse, and reverse the addiction?
02:50 Put—put down your device ’Cause if you don’t think twice,
02:56 The best in life will surely pass you by.
02:59 Look, listen, taste, and touch— The things we love so much
03:05 Have been here all along.  All you need to do is
03:10 Realize what’s in your hand is only superficial.
03:14 You’ve got real friends,  if you know what I mean.
03:18 Look at me. Can you see
03:22 What I see? Around the world, this happy family.
03:27 Look at me. Do you know
03:31 What I know? That you belong.
03:36 Put down the phone, and look at me.
03:39 Can you see What I see?
03:43 Around the world, this happy family.
03:46 Look at me. Do you know
03:50 What I know? That you belong.
03:55 Put down the phone, and look at me.

We got to go to Bethel, 
and I’m really, really glad.


00:18.080 --> 00:23.460
We all said it was the best time 
that our fam’ly ever had.


00:23.460 --> 00:28.465
The people there at Bethel 
serve Jehovah ev’ry day,


00:28.465 --> 00:34.000
Working hard in serving others, 
‘cause that’s just the Bethel way.


00:39.477 --> 00:49.987
Bethel means the “House of God.”
We call it Bethel because this place is his.


00:49.987 --> 00:54.325
Bethel—It’s the “House of God.”


00:54.325 --> 00:58.000
To serve Jehovah 
is the best work that there is.


01:08.005 --> 01:12.802
We saw the things they make there
—books and Bibles by the ton,


01:12.802 --> 01:18.099
So the truth about God’s Kingdom 
can go out to ev’ryone.


01:18.098 --> 01:23.228
If you can visit Bethel, 
you’ll be glad you got to go.


01:23.228 --> 01:29.000
It’s Jehovah’s house of service, 
and you’ll see it’s really so.


01:34.365 --> 01:44.667

01:44.667 --> 01:49.045

02:08.190 --> 02:12.318

00:01 How do we know  that Jehovah really sees each one of us,
00:05 no matter where we are?
00:07 Consider an example:
00:09 Thousands of refugees who faced
00:12 severe hardships in their home countries
00:14 have sought shelter in parts of Europe.
00:17 Watch how Jehovah  has lovingly assured them
00:21 that they’re not alone  by satisfying their spiritual thirst.
00:29 Welcome to Greece!
00:31 We really feel that Jehovah is blessing us
00:35 by opening a large door
00:37 of opportunities to preach the good news
00:41 to the many refugees  who are streaming into the country.
00:47 For this reason, the brothers  immediately informed us of the situation
00:52 and we directed the bodies of elders
00:55 to concentrate on the harbors,  especially in Chios.
00:58 The brothers were willing to work in shifts
01:02 —24 hours a day.
01:07 The refugee shelters in our area  only have families with children
01:11 and are located near a military airport.
01:14 Whenever military planes flew overhead
01:16 and the children would see and hear them,
01:18 they would immediately run  and try to hide because they were afraid.
01:22 They sought protection  from the tragic conditions
01:25 they had experienced during warfare.
01:27 This impressed upon us  how greatly they needed
01:29 the comforting message of the good news,
01:31 so we felt the urge to approach them.
01:36 Therefore,  the Service Department arranged
01:40 for four language classes  to be held for the brothers.
01:45 We try to speak to people
01:47 in a language quite different from our own.
01:49 At times, we might think:
01:50 ‘Will these people understand us?
01:52 Will we be able to reach  their heart with these basic truths?’
01:58 Something that helped me not to hesitate
02:00 to approach these people
02:01 despite the language barrier
02:03 is what our teachers told us  in the language class:
02:05 “Go and talk to them.
02:07 “Show them things from the Bible.
02:08 “Even if you don’t say things perfectly,
02:10 they will understand you.”
02:13 After we received permission
02:15 from the branch office,  we also printed thousands of tracts,
02:18 since we did not have enough.
02:20 This whole effort created  an atmosphere of enthusiasm.
02:27 I’m deeply moved when I see how lovingly
02:29 Jehovah cares for these people
02:31 who have never had the opportunity
02:33 to hear the Kingdom message
02:34 that gives them a future and a hope.
02:38 It was exciting
02:40 for them to hear that we have
02:42 a Bible-based video in their language.
02:46 We told them that the problems, calamities,
02:49 and the terrible war they had experienced
02:51 were not punishment from God,
02:53 but the result of the influence
02:55 Satan the Devil exercises  over this system of things.
02:58 And this provided  a good answer to their question.
03:03 On a return visit,
03:05 after two days,  a refugee girl said something very touching:
03:09 “Now I understand why  we have to go through all this.
03:11 It’s very difficult,  but it’s not God’s fault.”
03:14 On another occasion,  Gardinia, a refugee woman
03:18 who showed interest, told us:
03:20 “Since meeting you,  I have a purpose in life.
03:22 “I have a reason to live.
03:24 Until now, I was just waiting to die.”
03:32 A refugee approached  the Arabic witnessing cart,
03:34 and we read Revelation 21:4 to him.
03:37 He said, “Please,  could you read that to me once again?”
03:40 So we read it a second time.
03:42 He replied,
03:43 “May I have a Bible of my own?”
03:45 So we gave him a Bible.
03:47 Then he said,  “Would you please show me
03:48 the sentence you read in my Bible?”
03:51 So we marked the verse for him.
03:53 And on the way back
03:54 to our home at about 11 o’clock at night,
03:57 on the same road, at a well-lit point,
03:59 we saw that same refugee
04:01 sitting on the sidewalk reading the Bible.
04:04 About two and a half years ago,  I met Moustafa.
04:09 He attended the meetings  and made speedy progress.
04:11 Moustafa was baptized a few months
04:13 before the refugees started pouring in.
04:16 We do not believe  that this was a coincidence.
04:18 He would say,  “I want to speak about Jehovah,
04:22 but I can’t do that  in the Greek language.”
04:25 When I can speak to people who are refugees
04:28 —just as I am a refugee—
04:30 in my own language,
04:32 this is a great opportunity for me.
04:35 And when I see that they listen  to the truth and are loving it,
04:40 it makes my heart beat faster.
04:42 It touches my heart.
04:44 By expanding my ministry,
04:46 I’m sharing in a form of service
04:48 that could even be described  as missionary work,
04:50 since I’m helping  people hear about Jehovah
04:52 for the very first time.
04:54 I’m living what I have only read  about in experiences.
05:00 Many were —perhaps for the first time—
05:03 discovering new skills in themselves,
05:07 indicating how Jehovah  through his spirit can enable certain ones
05:11 to cultivate qualities they didn’t realize  they had to such an extent.
05:19 We are so grateful to Jehovah  for opening a door
05:21 leading to such wonderful activity.
05:23 It gives us great joy,  and we praise him daily for this.
05:30 At the time this report was prepared,
05:33 over 100 Bible studies had been started.
05:36 One refugee told the brothers:
05:38 “You are the best thing  that has happened to us here in Greece.
05:42 We thank Jehovah for meeting you.”
05:45 Another said:  “We do not need material things.
05:48 “We need hope,
05:50 and you are giving this  to us through the Bible.”

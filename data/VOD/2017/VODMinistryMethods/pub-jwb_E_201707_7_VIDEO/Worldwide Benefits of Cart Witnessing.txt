00:01 In 2001,  with the Governing Body’s approval,
00:04 our brothers in France  started using a variety of methods
00:07 to carry out our public witnessing,  including the use of carts.
00:12 The trial resulted  in many good experiences.
00:15 As a result, in 2011,
00:18 a pilot project with cart witnessing
00:21 in New York City, U.S.A., was approved.
00:25 Since Manhattan, in New York City,
00:28 had a ratio of 1 Jehovah’s Witness to 657 inhabitants,
00:32 this was a perfect choice.
00:34 That was the beginning  of a pilot program in Manhattan.
00:39 The program lasted one year,  using many graduates
00:42 from what was then  the Bible School for Christian Couples.
00:46 Although different tables  were used at the time,
00:48 it was evident that a mobile cart
00:50 had many advantages.
00:52 As a result, today,  Jehovah’s Witnesses are well-known
00:55 for their public witnessing using carts
00:58 designed to display their literature.
01:00 By means of this method,
01:01 good news from the Bible  can be taken to many places
01:04 and easily becomes available  to countless people.
01:10 These carts include different posters that:
01:13 call attention  to our well-known publications,
01:16 invite people to accept  free home Bible studies,
01:20 and direct passersby to our official website.
01:24 Here are just a few examples of how  this method has had many good results.
01:30 My name is Mi Jung You.
01:32 The first time I met Jehovah’s Witnesses
01:34 was more than 20 years ago.
01:36 I started studying  in the You Can Live Forever book,
01:39 but about a month later,
01:41 I had to stop studying.
01:43 After that,  I would accept the magazines,
01:47 but I never ended up  studying the Bible again.
01:49 In June of 2014, though,
01:52 I saw the public witnessing stand.
01:54 I realized that it belonged  to Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:57 So many of the different publications  they had caught my eye.
02:01 So I asked if it would be OK  if I took a copy of each one.
02:06 We ended up exchanging numbers,
02:08 and a few weeks later  the brother contacted me.
02:11 I began studying  the Bible again with the couple
02:15 and one month later  started attending meetings regularly.
02:20 I was baptized in October of 2015
02:23 and started auxiliary pioneering  right away for ten months.
02:27 Now I’m serving as a regular pioneer.
02:29 Public witnessing helped me find the truth,
02:33 and it’s a way for me to meet people  that are interested like I was.
02:37 I have really come to cherish  the public witnessing work.
02:42 My name is Jacob Salomé.
02:45 I work as a driver and spent most of my life
02:48 traveling all over Peru.
02:50 Because of this, I had problems  with the woman I was living with.
02:54 I never spent time at home  and practically lived in the truck.
03:02 I would see Jehovah’s Witnesses preaching
03:05 on the streets near the buses.
03:07 But since I was always driving,
03:09 I couldn’t park or even talk to them.
03:13 But once, I saw some Witnesses  preaching in a public square.
03:17 So I went up to them to ask them
03:19 what the Bible says about family matters.
03:24 This marked a change in my life.
03:28 My girlfriend and I  began attending meetings,
03:33 and then we got married and got baptized.
03:37 Now we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:42 As Annies and I were standing by our cart,  we met young Sudharshan.
03:47 Annies showed him our tract  Can the Dead Really Live Again?
03:51 He was surprised and said,  “How is it possible?”
03:53 When she explained to him Acts 24:15,
03:56 he exclaimed: “I am a Christian.  I never knew this!”
04:01 I asked him,  “Would you like to learn more
04:03 about such wonderful things  from the Bible?”
04:06 He asked,  “Can you tell me right now?”
04:09 There and then, I discussed the first chapter  of the Bible Teach book.
04:12 That’s how it started.
04:14 Sudharshan brought his friend, Sagar.
04:17 Sagar, in turn,  brought Shiva and Srikanth along.
04:21 Three of them are attending  our meetings regularly.
04:23 Sagar even turned down a job offer
04:26 that conflicted with Bible principles.
04:29 One tract resulted in many Bible studies.
04:32 We can really see Jehovah’s blessing
04:34 on this form of public witnessing.
04:52 Without a doubt,  cart witnessing is being used
04:55 to help preach  the good news of God’s Kingdom
04:57 “in all the inhabited earth  for a witness to all the nations.”

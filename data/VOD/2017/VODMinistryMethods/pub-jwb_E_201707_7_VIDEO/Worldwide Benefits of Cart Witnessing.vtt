00:01.117 --> 00:04.287
In 2001, 
with the Governing Body’s approval, 


00:04.287 --> 00:07.690
our brothers in France 
started using a variety of methods


00:07.690 --> 00:12.028
to carry out our public witnessing, 
including the use of carts. 


00:12.028 --> 00:15.465
The trial resulted 
in many good experiences. 


00:15.465 --> 00:18.668
As a result, in 2011, 


00:18.668 --> 00:21.103
a pilot project with cart witnessing 


00:21.103 --> 00:25.575
in New York City, U.S.A., was approved.


00:25.575 --> 00:28.043
Since Manhattan, in New York City, 


00:28.043 --> 00:32.215
had a ratio of 1 Jehovah’s Witness
to 657 inhabitants, 


00:32.215 --> 00:34.350
this was a perfect choice. 


00:34.350 --> 00:38.000
That was the beginning 
of a pilot program in Manhattan. 


00:39.722 --> 00:42.925
The program lasted one year, 
using many graduates 


00:42.925 --> 00:45.000
from what was then 
the Bible School for Christian Couples.


00:46.362 --> 00:48.732
Although different tables 
were used at the time, 


00:48.732 --> 00:50.734
it was evident that a mobile cart 


00:50.733 --> 00:52.835
had many advantages. 


00:52.835 --> 00:55.672
As a result, today, 
Jehovah’s Witnesses are well-known 


00:55.672 --> 00:58.575
for their public witnessing using carts  


00:58.575 --> 01:00.343
designed to display their literature. 


01:00.343 --> 01:01.745
By means of this method, 


01:01.745 --> 01:04.980
good news from the Bible 
can be taken to many places 


01:04.980 --> 01:08.000
and easily becomes available 
to countless people.


01:10.287 --> 01:13.524
These carts include different posters that: 


01:13.523 --> 01:16.525
call attention 
to our well-known publications, 


01:16.525 --> 01:20.163
invite people to accept 
free home Bible studies, 


01:20.163 --> 01:24.200
and direct passersby to our official website. 


01:24.200 --> 01:29.000
Here are just a few examples of how 
this method has had many good results.


01:30.407 --> 01:32.409
My name is Mi Jung You. 


01:32.408 --> 01:34.976
The first time I met Jehovah’s Witnesses 


01:34.977 --> 01:36.612
was more than 20 years ago. 


01:36.612 --> 01:39.715
I started studying 
in the You Can Live Forever book, 


01:39.715 --> 01:41.785
but about a month later, 


01:41.785 --> 01:43.787
I had to stop studying. 


01:43.787 --> 01:47.024
After that, 
I would accept the magazines, 


01:47.023 --> 01:49.358
but I never ended up 
studying the Bible again.


01:49.358 --> 01:52.361
In June of 2014, though, 


01:52.362 --> 01:54.697
I saw the public witnessing stand. 


01:54.697 --> 01:57.934
I realized that it belonged 
to Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


01:57.933 --> 02:01.570
So many of the different publications 
they had caught my eye. 


02:01.570 --> 02:06.175
So I asked if it would be OK 
if I took a copy of each one. 


02:06.175 --> 02:08.310
We ended up exchanging numbers, 


02:08.310 --> 02:11.213
and a few weeks later 
the brother contacted me. 


02:11.213 --> 02:15.351
I began studying 
the Bible again with the couple 


02:15.352 --> 02:20.190
and one month later 
started attending meetings regularly.


02:20.190 --> 02:23.660
I was baptized in October of 2015 


02:23.660 --> 02:27.363
and started auxiliary pioneering 
right away for ten months. 


02:27.363 --> 02:29.598
Now I’m serving as a regular pioneer. 


02:29.598 --> 02:33.301
Public witnessing helped me find the truth, 


02:33.302 --> 02:37.474
and it’s a way for me to meet people 
that are interested like I was. 


02:37.473 --> 02:42.945
I have really come to cherish 
the public witnessing work.


02:42.945 --> 02:45.915
My name is Jacob Salomé. 


02:45.915 --> 02:48.250
I work as a driver and spent most of my life 


02:48.250 --> 02:50.387
traveling all over Peru. 


02:50.387 --> 02:54.790
Because of this, I had problems 
with the woman I was living with. 


02:54.790 --> 02:58.000
I never spent time at home 
and practically lived in the truck.


03:02.798 --> 03:05.201
I would see Jehovah’s Witnesses preaching 


03:05.202 --> 03:07.237
on the streets near the buses. 


03:07.237 --> 03:09.639
But since I was always driving, 


03:09.638 --> 03:12.000
I couldn’t park or even talk to them. 


03:13.375 --> 03:17.113
But once, I saw some Witnesses 
preaching in a public square. 


03:17.113 --> 03:19.181
So I went up to them to ask them 


03:19.182 --> 03:22.000
what the Bible says about family matters.


03:24.253 --> 03:27.000
This marked a change in my life. 


03:28.925 --> 03:31.000
My girlfriend and I 
began attending meetings, 


03:33.597 --> 03:37.634
and then we got married and got baptized. 


03:37.633 --> 03:40.000
Now we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.


03:42.438 --> 03:47.110
As Annies and I were standing by our cart, 
we met young Sudharshan. 


03:47.110 --> 03:51.113
Annies showed him our tract 
Can the Dead Really Live Again? 


03:51.113 --> 03:53.916
He was surprised and said, 
“How is it possible?” 


03:53.917 --> 03:56.852
When she explained to him Acts 24:15, 


03:56.852 --> 04:01.357
he exclaimed: “I am a Christian. 
I never knew this!” 


04:01.357 --> 04:03.727
I asked him, 
“Would you like to learn more 


04:03.727 --> 04:06.029
about such wonderful things 
from the Bible?” 


04:06.028 --> 04:09.431
He asked, 
“Can you tell me right now?” 


04:09.432 --> 04:12.769
There and then, I discussed the first chapter 
of the Bible Teach book. 


04:12.768 --> 04:14.936
That’s how it started.


04:14.937 --> 04:17.374
Sudharshan brought his friend, Sagar. 


04:17.373 --> 04:21.410
Sagar, in turn, 
brought Shiva and Srikanth along. 


04:21.410 --> 04:23.880
Three of them are attending 
our meetings regularly. 


04:23.880 --> 04:26.548
Sagar even turned down a job offer 


04:26.548 --> 04:29.718
that conflicted with Bible principles. 


04:29.718 --> 04:32.788
One tract resulted in many Bible studies. 


04:32.788 --> 04:34.956
We can really see Jehovah’s blessing 


04:34.957 --> 04:37.000
on this form of public witnessing.


04:52.342 --> 04:55.144
Without a doubt, 
cart witnessing is being used 


04:55.143 --> 04:57.513
to help preach 
the good news of God’s Kingdom 


04:57.513 --> 05:21.488
“in all the inhabited earth 
for a witness to all the nations.”

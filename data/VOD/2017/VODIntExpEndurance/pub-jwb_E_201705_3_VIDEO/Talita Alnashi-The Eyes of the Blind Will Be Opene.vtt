00:02.185 --> 00:06.322
Let’s begin by visiting a family 
in Stockholm, Sweden. 


00:06.322 --> 00:10.460
The parents, Usama and Kristina, 
have two daughters, 


00:10.460 --> 00:13.028
Talita and Isabella. 


00:13.028 --> 00:15.065
When Talita was born, 


00:15.065 --> 00:18.835
the doctor found cataracts 
in both of her eyes. 


00:18.835 --> 00:22.905
A cataract is a clouding 
of the eye’s natural lens. 


00:22.905 --> 00:24.907
So the doctor had to operate 


00:24.907 --> 00:28.044
so that Talita wouldn’t lose 
her sight completely


00:28.043 --> 00:32.181
—a terrifying situation 
for any parent. 


00:32.182 --> 00:34.617
Today, Talita is seven years old 


00:34.617 --> 00:37.054
and almost blind in one eye 


00:37.053 --> 00:40.223
but completely blind in the other. 


00:40.223 --> 00:42.225
Teaching a child about Jehovah 


00:42.225 --> 00:44.693
in this system of things 
is already a challenge 


00:44.693 --> 00:48.063
even without physical ailments involved. 


00:48.063 --> 00:52.501
But let’s find out how Talita’s parents 
rose to the challenge, 


00:52.502 --> 00:56.439
making sure that she received 
a proper spiritual education 


00:56.438 --> 00:58.000
despite her poor vision.


01:04.013 --> 01:07.616
I look forward to not having 
poor sight anymore 


01:07.617 --> 01:10.620
and that I can play 
with a bear and a lion 


01:10.620 --> 01:13.000
and to sit 
on the back of a tiger.


01:14.923 --> 01:19.761
Jehovah gives us 
a fantastic promise at Isaiah 35:5: 


01:19.762 --> 01:22.000
“The eyes of the blind will be opened.”


01:23.867 --> 01:28.439
It’s been a challenge 
to get to where we are today. 


01:28.438 --> 01:31.000
We thank Jehovah 
for all the help he has given us.


01:32.175 --> 01:36.345
As soon as Talita was able 
to leave the house after the operation, 


01:36.345 --> 01:39.000
we made sure 
to go to the meetings.


01:40.950 --> 01:44.000
It helped us a lot to be able 
to throw our burden on Jehovah. 


01:45.855 --> 01:48.023
We prayed together; 


01:48.023 --> 01:51.000
we cried a lot together 
because it was so hard.


01:55.332 --> 01:57.334
One of the challenges 


01:57.333 --> 02:01.470
is that we have to give 
Talita audio description constantly. 


02:01.470 --> 02:05.000
We have to tell her who is coming in 
and what is happening.


02:06.642 --> 02:11.014
We get so many amazing materials 
on jw.org 


02:11.013 --> 02:14.750
and also through the congregation. 


02:14.750 --> 02:17.000
She really loves to read 
Learn From the Great Teacher. 


02:18.387 --> 02:23.000
It has questions 
which make her a part of the story.


02:25.162 --> 02:26.997
She has a very good memory, 


02:26.997 --> 02:30.267
and therefore she remembers 
a lot of what she reads. 


02:30.267 --> 02:34.000
So when we are with friends, 
she often quizzes them.


03:04.767 --> 03:07.000
I really like to sing 
the songs in my songbook.


03:09.638 --> 03:11.615
Talita’s spiritual goal


03:11.615 --> 03:15.978
is to learn more of our Kingdom songs. 


03:15.978 --> 03:17.980
We get so much help 


03:17.980 --> 03:21.117
from the beautiful music 
on the website 


03:21.117 --> 03:25.000
and also 
from the Caleb and Sophia videos.


03:26.990 --> 03:30.192
She knows many of the stories
from My Book of Bible Stories,


03:30.192 --> 03:32.962
so she can answer 
in her own words. 


03:32.962 --> 03:36.432
We will ask a question like, 
Do you know this about David? 


03:36.432 --> 03:38.300
And if she knows the answer, 


03:38.300 --> 03:41.000
then we encourage her 
to answer at the meeting.


03:47.410 --> 03:49.578
When I give an answer 
at the meetings, 


03:49.578 --> 03:50.946
Jehovah becomes happy 


03:50.947 --> 03:53.000
because he loves children.


03:54.117 --> 03:56.352
She often asks the friends, 


03:56.352 --> 03:57.820
“Do you love Jehovah?” 


03:57.820 --> 04:00.000
So she feels very united with them.


04:04.260 --> 04:06.395
One of the best moments where we saw 


04:06.395 --> 04:08.832
that Talita’s spirituality had grown 


04:08.832 --> 04:11.200
was when she came home from a sleepover 


04:11.200 --> 04:13.202
at her grandparents’ house. 


04:13.202 --> 04:15.839
My parents are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


04:15.838 --> 04:17.473
and her grandmother had said 


04:17.473 --> 04:19.408
that God doesn’t exist. 


04:19.408 --> 04:22.278
So when Talita came home, she said, 


04:22.278 --> 04:25.180
“And then when I was going to sleep, 
I prayed to Jehovah,


04:25.180 --> 04:27.150
“‘Would you please help Grandmother 


04:27.150 --> 04:31.000
to realize that you do exist
—that you are real?’”


04:34.623 --> 04:38.226
We try to keep 
our wonderful hope alive, 


04:38.227 --> 04:41.330
so we often talk  about 
what we will do 


04:41.330 --> 04:43.565
in Paradise. 


04:43.565 --> 04:47.370
We really look forward to when Talita 
will be able to see again 


04:47.370 --> 04:50.307
and live in a paradise 
with all our friends. 


04:50.307 --> 04:53.000
It’s going to be wonderful!


04:54.543 --> 04:57.546
I think that Jehovah 
looks forward to looking at me 


04:57.547 --> 05:10.277
when I play with a tiger.

00:02 Let’s begin by visiting a family  in Stockholm, Sweden.
00:06 The parents, Usama and Kristina,  have two daughters,
00:10 Talita and Isabella.
00:13 When Talita was born,
00:15 the doctor found cataracts  in both of her eyes.
00:18 A cataract is a clouding  of the eye’s natural lens.
00:22 So the doctor had to operate
00:24 so that Talita wouldn’t lose  her sight completely
00:28 —a terrifying situation  for any parent.
00:32 Today, Talita is seven years old
00:34 and almost blind in one eye
00:37 but completely blind in the other.
00:40 Teaching a child about Jehovah
00:42 in this system of things  is already a challenge
00:44 even without physical ailments involved.
00:48 But let’s find out how Talita’s parents  rose to the challenge,
00:52 making sure that she received  a proper spiritual education
00:56 despite her poor vision.
01:04 I look forward to not having  poor sight anymore
01:07 and that I can play  with a bear and a lion
01:10 and to sit  on the back of a tiger.
01:14 Jehovah gives us  a fantastic promise at Isaiah 35:5:
01:19 “The eyes of the blind will be opened.”
01:23 It’s been a challenge  to get to where we are today.
01:28 We thank Jehovah  for all the help he has given us.
01:32 As soon as Talita was able  to leave the house after the operation,
01:36 we made sure  to go to the meetings.
01:40 It helped us a lot to be able  to throw our burden on Jehovah.
01:45 We prayed together;
01:48 we cried a lot together  because it was so hard.
01:55 One of the challenges
01:57 is that we have to give  Talita audio description constantly.
02:01 We have to tell her who is coming in  and what is happening.
02:06 We get so many amazing materials  on jw.org
02:11 and also through the congregation.
02:14 She really loves to read  Learn From the Great Teacher.
02:18 It has questions  which make her a part of the story.
02:25 She has a very good memory,
02:26 and therefore she remembers  a lot of what she reads.
02:30 So when we are with friends,  she often quizzes them.
03:04 I really like to sing  the songs in my songbook.
03:09 Talita’s spiritual goal
03:11 is to learn more of our Kingdom songs.
03:15 We get so much help
03:17 from the beautiful music  on the website
03:21 and also  from the Caleb and Sophia videos.
03:26 She knows many of the stories from My Book of Bible Stories,
03:30 so she can answer  in her own words.
03:32 We will ask a question like,  Do you know this about David?
03:36 And if she knows the answer,
03:38 then we encourage her  to answer at the meeting.
03:47 When I give an answer  at the meetings,
03:49 Jehovah becomes happy
03:50 because he loves children.
03:54 She often asks the friends,
03:56 “Do you love Jehovah?”
03:57 So she feels very united with them.
04:04 One of the best moments where we saw
04:06 that Talita’s spirituality had grown
04:08 was when she came home from a sleepover
04:11 at her grandparents’ house.
04:13 My parents are not Jehovah’s Witnesses,
04:15 and her grandmother had said
04:17 that God doesn’t exist.
04:19 So when Talita came home, she said,
04:22 “And then when I was going to sleep,  I prayed to Jehovah,
04:25 “‘Would you please help Grandmother
04:27 to realize that you do exist —that you are real?’”
04:34 We try to keep  our wonderful hope alive,
04:38 so we often talk  about  what we will do
04:41 in Paradise.
04:43 We really look forward to when Talita  will be able to see again
04:47 and live in a paradise  with all our friends.
04:50 It’s going to be wonderful!
04:54 I think that Jehovah  looks forward to looking at me
04:57 when I play with a tiger.

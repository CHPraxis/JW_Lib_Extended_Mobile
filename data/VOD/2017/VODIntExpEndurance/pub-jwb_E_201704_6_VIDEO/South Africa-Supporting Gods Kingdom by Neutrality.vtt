00:01.918 --> 00:04.653
Jehovah gives us his holy spirit, 


00:04.653 --> 00:07.490
both individually and as a group. 


00:07.490 --> 00:12.328
To see evidence of that, 
we need only go to a part of the world 


00:12.328 --> 00:16.031
where Jehovah’s people 
were put under intense pressure. 


00:16.032 --> 00:18.702
In South Africa, for example, 


00:18.702 --> 00:23.674
the government’s policy 
of racial segregation, called apartheid, 


00:23.673 --> 00:27.843
lasted for 46 years, until 1994. 


00:27.843 --> 00:32.315
Our brothers were pressured 
to take sides in armed conflict. 


00:32.315 --> 00:35.418
Their freedom to worship together 
was limited. 


00:35.418 --> 00:39.588
And the prevailing attitudes 
 towards people of different races 


00:39.588 --> 00:41.623
threatened their unity. 


00:41.623 --> 00:45.395
In this report, we learn 
how our South African brothers 


00:45.395 --> 00:50.000
remained united and neutral 
and in support of God’s Kingdom.


00:59.975 --> 01:03.680
One afternoon 
when we came to the station, 


01:03.680 --> 01:07.483
there were men who were directing things
and we were directed  


01:07.483 --> 01:09.918
to a coach for whites only. 


01:09.918 --> 01:11.755
That was the first time 


01:11.755 --> 01:16.000
that we saw apartheid being law enforced.


01:18.360 --> 01:21.263
You could not leave the black areas 


01:21.263 --> 01:24.000
where your home was 
without getting a permit. 


01:25.033 --> 01:29.371
We were even given a permit that stipulated 
which area we were allowed 


01:29.372 --> 01:32.000
to do the preaching work in.


01:34.477 --> 01:36.712
People would always ask us: 


01:36.712 --> 01:39.149
“What are you doing to fight apartheid?” 


01:39.148 --> 01:41.150
We had to boldly tell them: 


01:41.150 --> 01:43.720
“God’s Kingdom is the only solution. 


01:43.720 --> 01:47.057
“God will help the whole earth 
to live in peace one day, 


01:47.057 --> 01:51.000
so we cannot take sides 
on political issues now.”


01:53.530 --> 01:55.565
Here at home in Soweto, 
we heard the sound 


01:55.565 --> 01:58.000
of children running in the streets. 


01:59.702 --> 02:02.705
We heard the sound of gunshots; 


02:02.705 --> 02:05.875
tear gas was everywhere.


02:05.875 --> 02:08.177
When my husband came home that day, 


02:08.177 --> 02:11.114
we sat with the children 
and took out the book 


02:11.113 --> 02:13.415
Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It 


02:13.415 --> 02:16.000
and we studied the topic 
“How Do You View Your Parents?” 


02:18.688 --> 02:20.756
This was appropriate 


02:20.757 --> 02:22.992
because children had the spirit of rebelling 


02:22.992 --> 02:25.000
against their own parents.


02:26.395 --> 02:29.000
They went as far as burning people.


02:31.700 --> 02:34.437
They came shouting my son’s name:


02:34.437 --> 02:38.000
“Aquila, Mathiba, come out, come out!” 


02:39.075 --> 02:41.477
And one of them defended him and said:


02:41.477 --> 02:45.715
“No, no, no, not Aquila! 


02:45.715 --> 02:48.718
“Aquila does not do these things. 


02:48.718 --> 02:51.000
He will never protest.”


02:52.655 --> 02:57.000
Ahh, I saw Jehovah’s hand in this. 


02:58.260 --> 03:00.230
Even under those circumstances, 


03:00.230 --> 03:02.265
Jehovah helped our children 


03:02.265 --> 03:05.033
not to dwell on the madness 
in the streets, 


03:05.033 --> 03:08.000
and we focused on spiritual things.


03:09.972 --> 03:13.042
In 1968, when I was 19 years old, 


03:13.042 --> 03:15.044
I was sentenced to jail 


03:15.043 --> 03:17.346
for refusing to do military service.


03:17.347 --> 03:20.317
Over a period of 20 years, 


03:20.317 --> 03:23.119
close to 1,000 young white Witness men 


03:23.118 --> 03:26.555
similarly took their stand 
for neutrality in this country.


03:26.555 --> 03:30.593
We used to pray 
for our white brothers in prison. 


03:30.593 --> 03:34.763
People in the black townships respected us 


03:34.763 --> 03:37.000
for the stand these brothers were taking.


03:42.505 --> 03:44.240
In 1974, 


03:44.240 --> 03:48.077
over 30,000 black and white brothers met 


03:48.077 --> 03:53.000
for the afternoon session 
of the “Divine Victory” Assembly.


03:54.250 --> 03:56.252
When we first arrived, 


03:56.252 --> 03:59.000
there were policemen everywhere. 


04:01.657 --> 04:03.960
But after half an hour, 


04:03.960 --> 04:06.195
they saw how peaceful it was 


04:06.195 --> 04:08.000
and so they left.


04:10.367 --> 04:12.369
For those few hours 


04:12.368 --> 04:15.605
in the dark era of apartheid, 


04:15.605 --> 04:17.840
we felt 


04:17.840 --> 04:21.000
the glorious brotherly love 
as we praised Jehovah 


04:22.378 --> 04:25.000
together.


04:31.820 --> 04:34.223
Brother Moses Nyamussua was asked 


04:34.223 --> 04:37.526
by a group on their way to a political rally 


04:37.527 --> 04:39.595
to weld weapons for them. 


04:39.595 --> 04:42.732
He refused to do so.


04:42.732 --> 04:45.702
After their rally, 
they went back to him and said: 


04:45.702 --> 04:48.705
“You refused to weld our weapons, 


04:48.705 --> 04:52.208
“and some of our comrades 
were killed in a fight at the rally. 


04:52.208 --> 04:55.311
Now you will die.”


04:55.312 --> 04:58.782
Brother Nyamussua maintained his neutrality 


04:58.782 --> 05:01.084
all the way to death, 


05:01.083 --> 05:04.000
and Jehovah will remember him.


05:07.707 --> 05:10.377
In 1993, I was amazed 


05:10.377 --> 05:12.679
when a white person 
came preaching house to house. 


05:12.678 --> 05:14.713
They came with another white man 


05:14.713 --> 05:17.550
who could speak Venda fluently. 


05:17.550 --> 05:20.320
That excited me a lot, 
and as time went by, 


05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
I came to realize 


05:22.322 --> 05:25.525
that this is the true religion 
because they were faithful friends 


05:25.525 --> 05:29.562
and they spoke to me like we were family.


05:29.562 --> 05:32.899
In the late 1980’s, 
the government granted us permission 


05:32.898 --> 05:35.033
to come in and build Kingdom Halls 


05:35.033 --> 05:37.103
in the black townships. 


05:37.103 --> 05:39.371
The local community 
was absolutely amazed 


05:39.372 --> 05:41.240
to see all these whites 


05:41.240 --> 05:43.408
pouring in and working hard 


05:43.408 --> 05:45.578
along with their black brothers 


05:45.578 --> 05:47.613
to build these beautiful Kingdom Halls.


05:47.613 --> 05:50.048
It was a wonderful privilege 
to get to know other young people 


05:50.048 --> 05:52.051
of different races.


05:52.052 --> 05:55.020
Everyone in the congregation feels 
like family 


05:55.020 --> 05:57.023
as long as they serve Jehovah.


05:57.023 --> 06:00.426
Just see yourself.


06:00.427 --> 06:03.062
Just see me too.


06:03.062 --> 06:05.164
Just see us all. . .


06:05.163 --> 06:10.301
. . . in a world that is new.


06:10.302 --> 06:12.539
Today, in South Africa, 


06:12.538 --> 06:15.575
there are more than 100,000 Witnesses 


06:15.575 --> 06:19.112
worshipping together in spirit and truth. 


06:19.112 --> 06:22.482
South Africa has 11 official languages. 


06:22.482 --> 06:25.050
Yet, across that cultural variety, 


06:25.050 --> 06:29.422
our brothers and sisters 
are all speaking the “pure language”


06:29.422 --> 06:39.232
—the truth about Jehovah God 
and his purposes.

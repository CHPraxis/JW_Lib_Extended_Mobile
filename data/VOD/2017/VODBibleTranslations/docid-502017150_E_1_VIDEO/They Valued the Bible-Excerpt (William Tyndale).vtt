00:19.998 --> 00:23.001
In the autumn of 1536, 


00:23.002 --> 00:27.380
William Tyndale was led from his prison cell, 
in the castle of Vilvoorde, 


00:27.380 --> 00:30.300
to the site of his impending execution. 


00:30.300 --> 00:33.553
There a post had been prepared for him. 


00:33.553 --> 00:37.140
Tyndale was chained to the post, 


00:37.140 --> 00:39.142
strangled to death, 


00:39.142 --> 00:41.895
and then his body burned 


00:41.895 --> 00:43.897
before the onlooking crowd. 


00:43.897 --> 00:45.900
His crime? 


00:45.900 --> 00:49.778
Tyndale struggled to reconcile 
the teachings of the church 


00:49.778 --> 00:52.280
with his own studies of the Bible. 


00:52.280 --> 00:56.535
William Tyndale died 
with his faith intact 


00:56.535 --> 01:00.000
that the Bible 
is the Word of God.


01:04.710 --> 01:07.128
William Tyndale 
was the first person to seek 


01:07.128 --> 01:09.881
to translate the Bible 
from the original languages 


01:09.882 --> 01:11.884
into English.


01:11.883 --> 01:15.136
Tyndale was born 
in the late 15th century. 


01:15.137 --> 01:18.265
He was born 
in the area of Gloucestershire 


01:18.265 --> 01:22.393
but had a chance to go to Oxford 
and became a priest.


01:22.393 --> 01:25.188
In the 15th century, 
there was a lot of resistance


01:25.188 --> 01:27.190
—the idea that the Word of God 


01:27.190 --> 01:30.318
could just simply be accessible 
by the general people.


01:30.318 --> 01:33.571
People knew the Latin Bible from church, 


01:33.572 --> 01:36.284
which was interpreted by the priest for them. 


01:36.283 --> 01:39.661
They never had direct access 
to the Bible themselves.


01:39.662 --> 01:42.832
Tyndale was not allowed 
to do this translation in England. 


01:42.832 --> 01:44.875
He went to the Bishop of London 


01:44.875 --> 01:49.087
asking for his permission 
to translate the New Testament 


01:49.087 --> 01:52.132
from the Greek
—the original text—


01:52.132 --> 01:56.000
into English 
but was not given that permission.


01:58.097 --> 02:00.765
Such was the opposition 
to Bible translation 


02:00.765 --> 02:03.018
that Tyndale later wrote 
that there was 


02:03.018 --> 02:05.478
no place to do it in all England. 


02:05.478 --> 02:09.441
And so with the help of merchants 
sympathetic to his cause, 


02:09.442 --> 02:12.862
Tyndale fled to Germany 
where he could more easily work 


02:12.862 --> 02:15.990
on his English translation 
of the New Testament. 


02:15.990 --> 02:17.992
By 1525, 


02:17.992 --> 02:20.995
his translation was complete 
and ready to be printed. 


02:20.995 --> 02:24.623
The British Library in London 
holds the answer 


02:24.623 --> 02:26.625
to what happened next. 


02:26.625 --> 02:30.128
Dr. Karen Limper-Herz, 
a lead curator at the library, 


02:30.128 --> 02:32.715
is going to help us find out.


02:32.715 --> 02:35.717
So we are looking 
at a unique copy of the first edition 


02:35.717 --> 02:38.887
of Tyndale’s New Testament, 
printed in Cologne in 1525. 


02:38.887 --> 02:41.265
The Cologne Fragment 
is the only known copy 


02:41.265 --> 02:43.392
of what exists of Tyndale’s first edition 


02:43.392 --> 02:45.102
of the New Testament. 


02:45.102 --> 02:47.645
The fact that it is a fragment 
shows that it was a dangerous thing to do. 


02:47.645 --> 02:50.232
The printer had too much to drink 


02:50.232 --> 02:52.067
and mentioned that he 


02:52.067 --> 02:56.072
was printing 
this pro-Lutheran English New Testament 


02:56.072 --> 02:58.074
for somebody called William Tyndale. 


02:58.073 --> 03:00.866
The authorities found out about it, 
and the print shop was raided. 


03:00.867 --> 03:02.870
Tyndale and his partners ran


03:02.870 --> 03:04.872
—and this is all that survives today—


03:04.872 --> 03:06.957
and they went down the Rhine 
a bit further to Worms. 


03:06.957 --> 03:10.419
So the fact that they didn’t get much further 
than part way through Matthew 


03:10.418 --> 03:12.420
is quite indicative 
of how dangerous it was.


03:12.420 --> 03:15.965
The first complete copies 
of Tyndale’s translation 


03:15.965 --> 03:19.553
of the Christian Greek Scriptures 
were finally printed 


03:19.553 --> 03:22.263
in the city of Worms in Germany 


03:22.263 --> 03:24.265
in 1526. 


03:24.265 --> 03:29.000
Around 3,000 or more 
of these books were produced.


03:36.487 --> 03:38.489
After leaving Germany, 


03:38.488 --> 03:41.000
Tyndale moved to Antwerp. 


03:42.533 --> 03:45.120
This bustling city 
was ideal for Tyndale. 


03:45.120 --> 03:47.705
It had a thriving printing industry 


03:47.705 --> 03:49.833
and its busy port 


03:49.833 --> 03:53.420
made it easy for his books 
to reach readers in England. 


03:53.420 --> 03:56.423
Professor Guido Latré 
has kindly offered to show me 


03:56.423 --> 03:59.885
around the very streets that Tyndale 
would have walked himself 


03:59.885 --> 04:02.262
some 500 years ago.


04:02.262 --> 04:06.100
What he saw around him here 
were ordinary people 


04:06.100 --> 04:08.602
having access to the Bible in Dutch. 


04:08.602 --> 04:12.522
He wanted the same 
for his own folk in England. 


04:12.522 --> 04:16.569
If you wanted to smuggle Bibles 
on a large scale into England, 


04:16.568 --> 04:20.696
this was Northern Europe’s biggest seaport. 


04:20.697 --> 04:23.784
You can’t easily smuggle 


04:23.783 --> 04:26.536
a big volume and a big format. 


04:26.537 --> 04:29.874
So tiny loose leaves 


04:29.873 --> 04:31.583
that were taken to places like this


04:31.583 --> 04:33.585
—these underground cellars, 
the warehouses—


04:33.585 --> 04:35.878
and between the leaves 


04:35.878 --> 04:38.215
of larger books 
that were not forbidden, 


04:38.215 --> 04:42.052
the tiny leaves of Tyndale’s translation 
would have been hidden. 


04:42.052 --> 04:44.429
In London, 
someone would have recognized: 


04:44.428 --> 04:47.098
‘Aha! 
These are the stacks that are marked. 


04:47.098 --> 04:49.601
‘I must have a look at these 


04:49.602 --> 04:52.479
and find the loose leaves 
of Tyndale’s Bible.’ 


04:52.478 --> 04:55.815
There were about 30,000 copies 


04:55.815 --> 04:57.818
of Tyndale’s Bible available 


04:57.818 --> 04:58.985
by the end of his life. 


04:58.985 --> 05:02.197
This was a brave man 
and a big man in terms of courage 


05:02.197 --> 05:04.700
and in terms of investment of time. 


05:04.700 --> 05:08.000
And the risks he took 
are not to be underestimated.


05:09.622 --> 05:11.999
William Tyndale was imprisoned here


05:11.998 --> 05:14.835
in Vilvoorde, 
just north of Brussels. 


05:14.835 --> 05:16.753
As he languished 
in prison for over a year, 


05:16.753 --> 05:21.000
he no doubt contemplated the cruel death 
that inevitably awaited him. 


05:22.175 --> 05:26.180
Tyndale is often renowned 
for his influence on the English language, 


05:26.180 --> 05:30.475
but his work was more than 
that of just scholarly ambition. 


05:30.475 --> 05:33.728
Tyndale loved the Bible. 


05:33.728 --> 05:35.730
Maybe it can be said of him 


05:35.730 --> 05:38.775
that he shared the feelings of the psalmist 
who spoke of God’s Word 


05:38.775 --> 05:43.000
and said: 
“How I do love your law!”


05:45.323 --> 05:48.576
Despite intense opposition,


05:48.577 --> 05:52.080
the Bible and the wisdom in it 
survives to this day, 


05:52.080 --> 05:55.875
a faithful transmission 
of the original writers’ words. 


05:55.875 --> 06:17.002
No wonder so many have placed 
such value on the Bible.

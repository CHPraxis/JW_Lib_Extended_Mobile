00:19 In the autumn of 1536,
00:23 William Tyndale was led from his prison cell,  in the castle of Vilvoorde,
00:27 to the site of his impending execution.
00:30 There a post had been prepared for him.
00:33 Tyndale was chained to the post,
00:37 strangled to death,
00:39 and then his body burned
00:41 before the onlooking crowd.
00:43 His crime?
00:45 Tyndale struggled to reconcile  the teachings of the church
00:49 with his own studies of the Bible.
00:52 William Tyndale died  with his faith intact
00:56 that the Bible  is the Word of God.
01:04 William Tyndale  was the first person to seek
01:07 to translate the Bible  from the original languages
01:09 into English.
01:11 Tyndale was born  in the late 15th century.
01:15 He was born  in the area of Gloucestershire
01:18 but had a chance to go to Oxford  and became a priest.
01:22 In the 15th century,  there was a lot of resistance
01:25 —the idea that the Word of God
01:27 could just simply be accessible  by the general people.
01:30 People knew the Latin Bible from church,
01:33 which was interpreted by the priest for them.
01:36 They never had direct access  to the Bible themselves.
01:39 Tyndale was not allowed  to do this translation in England.
01:42 He went to the Bishop of London
01:44 asking for his permission  to translate the New Testament
01:49 from the Greek —the original text—
01:52 into English  but was not given that permission.
01:58 Such was the opposition  to Bible translation
02:00 that Tyndale later wrote  that there was
02:03 no place to do it in all England.
02:05 And so with the help of merchants  sympathetic to his cause,
02:09 Tyndale fled to Germany  where he could more easily work
02:12 on his English translation  of the New Testament.
02:15 By 1525,
02:17 his translation was complete  and ready to be printed.
02:20 The British Library in London  holds the answer
02:24 to what happened next.
02:26 Dr. Karen Limper-Herz,  a lead curator at the library,
02:30 is going to help us find out.
02:32 So we are looking  at a unique copy of the first edition
02:35 of Tyndale’s New Testament,  printed in Cologne in 1525.
02:38 The Cologne Fragment  is the only known copy
02:41 of what exists of Tyndale’s first edition
02:43 of the New Testament.
02:45 The fact that it is a fragment  shows that it was a dangerous thing to do.
02:47 The printer had too much to drink
02:50 and mentioned that he
02:52 was printing  this pro-Lutheran English New Testament
02:56 for somebody called William Tyndale.
02:58 The authorities found out about it,  and the print shop was raided.
03:00 Tyndale and his partners ran
03:02 —and this is all that survives today—
03:04 and they went down the Rhine  a bit further to Worms.
03:06 So the fact that they didn’t get much further  than part way through Matthew
03:10 is quite indicative  of how dangerous it was.
03:12 The first complete copies  of Tyndale’s translation
03:15 of the Christian Greek Scriptures  were finally printed
03:19 in the city of Worms in Germany
03:22 in 1526.
03:24 Around 3,000 or more  of these books were produced.
03:36 After leaving Germany,
03:38 Tyndale moved to Antwerp.
03:42 This bustling city  was ideal for Tyndale.
03:45 It had a thriving printing industry
03:47 and its busy port
03:49 made it easy for his books  to reach readers in England.
03:53 Professor Guido Latré  has kindly offered to show me
03:56 around the very streets that Tyndale  would have walked himself
03:59 some 500 years ago.
04:02 What he saw around him here  were ordinary people
04:06 having access to the Bible in Dutch.
04:08 He wanted the same  for his own folk in England.
04:12 If you wanted to smuggle Bibles  on a large scale into England,
04:16 this was Northern Europe’s biggest seaport.
04:20 You can’t easily smuggle
04:23 a big volume and a big format.
04:26 So tiny loose leaves
04:29 that were taken to places like this
04:31 —these underground cellars,  the warehouses—
04:33 and between the leaves
04:35 of larger books  that were not forbidden,
04:38 the tiny leaves of Tyndale’s translation  would have been hidden.
04:42 In London,  someone would have recognized:
04:44 ‘Aha!  These are the stacks that are marked.
04:47 ‘I must have a look at these
04:49 and find the loose leaves  of Tyndale’s Bible.’
04:52 There were about 30,000 copies
04:55 of Tyndale’s Bible available
04:57 by the end of his life.
04:58 This was a brave man  and a big man in terms of courage
05:02 and in terms of investment of time.
05:04 And the risks he took  are not to be underestimated.
05:09 William Tyndale was imprisoned here
05:11 in Vilvoorde,  just north of Brussels.
05:14 As he languished  in prison for over a year,
05:16 he no doubt contemplated the cruel death  that inevitably awaited him.
05:22 Tyndale is often renowned  for his influence on the English language,
05:26 but his work was more than  that of just scholarly ambition.
05:30 Tyndale loved the Bible.
05:33 Maybe it can be said of him
05:35 that he shared the feelings of the psalmist  who spoke of God’s Word
05:38 and said:  “How I do love your law!”
05:45 Despite intense opposition,
05:48 the Bible and the wisdom in it  survives to this day,
05:52 a faithful transmission  of the original writers’ words.
05:55 No wonder so many have placed  such value on the Bible.

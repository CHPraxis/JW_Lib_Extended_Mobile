00:23.960 --> 00:28.000
Welcome to Bethel. 
Please come in.


00:30.342 --> 00:33.262
The wonderful truths about Jehovah 


00:33.262 --> 00:36.474
and his purpose 
have touched the hearts of millions 


00:36.473 --> 00:39.000
of people earth wide.


00:50.737 --> 00:53.907
This has moved many 
to visit the branch offices 


00:53.907 --> 00:58.000
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 
in countries around the world.


01:06.337 --> 01:10.882
Why are such branch offices necessary?


01:10.882 --> 01:14.762
In order for life-giving truths 
to reach everyone, 


01:14.762 --> 01:16.764
the preaching work 


01:16.763 --> 01:20.000
must be organized.


01:24.605 --> 01:27.023
A Branch Committee oversees 


01:27.023 --> 01:31.000
all Bethel operations.


01:35.992 --> 01:39.370
These brothers 
also look after the preaching work 


01:39.370 --> 01:42.000
throughout the branch territory.


01:48.878 --> 01:50.880
Our translation teams 


01:50.880 --> 01:55.000
translate articles and videos 
into several local languages.


02:10.567 --> 02:14.572
These are recorded 
and made available on jw.org 


02:14.572 --> 02:17.000
or sent electronically for printing.


02:31.047 --> 02:33.632
The activity of traveling overseers 


02:33.632 --> 02:37.344
as well as nearly 200 special pioneers 
and missionaries 


02:37.343 --> 02:40.000
is coordinated by the Service Department.


02:43.142 --> 02:46.395
These brothers also take care of organizing 


02:46.395 --> 02:49.440
the more than 130 congregations 


02:49.440 --> 02:54.000
throughout the branch territory.


02:58.032 --> 03:01.327
With the growth of Kingdom interests, 


03:01.327 --> 03:05.000
comes a constant need 
for more theocratic buildings.


03:08.000 --> 03:11.670
The Local Design/Construction Department 


03:11.670 --> 03:13.672
cares for construction projects 


03:13.672 --> 03:17.000
such as Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.


03:43.577 --> 03:49.000
It also cares for operating 
and maintaining these buildings.


03:59.258 --> 04:03.263
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
have a deep respect for life 


04:03.263 --> 04:05.931
and want the best possible medical care. 


04:05.932 --> 04:07.935
The Hospital Information Desk 


04:07.935 --> 04:11.000
provides assistance 
with nonblood medical management. 


04:12.730 --> 04:15.942
It coordinates 
with Hospital Liaison Committees (HLC) 


04:15.942 --> 04:20.000
and cooperative doctors 
around the country.


04:23.098 --> 04:26.578
A lack of transport 
and poor road conditions 


04:26.578 --> 04:29.205
make it really a challenge 
for the HLC members 


04:29.205 --> 04:31.333
to travel around the country 


04:31.333 --> 04:33.335
to visit the hospitals and the clinics. 


04:33.335 --> 04:35.837
But their self-sacrificing spirit 


04:35.837 --> 04:37.255
and the love they have for the brothers, 


04:37.255 --> 04:40.132
along with some fine medical presentations, 


04:40.132 --> 04:44.345
have really had a positive effect 
on many doctors and hospital staff, 


04:44.345 --> 04:47.140
who are now willing 
to use nonblood treatment 


04:47.140 --> 04:49.560
in working with our brothers and sisters. 


04:49.560 --> 04:52.207
So we can honestly say 
that we have seen 


04:52.207 --> 04:58.000
Jehovah’s rich blessing and direction 
on the work of the HLC brothers.


05:12.123 --> 05:15.210
All who live and work here 


05:15.210 --> 05:18.213
are part of what we call 
the Bethel family. 


05:18.213 --> 05:22.258
We call it a family 
because that is how we 


05:22.258 --> 05:27.000
truly feel about one another.


05:37.690 --> 05:40.985
Just as you have 
your family worship every week, 


05:40.985 --> 05:45.865
so the Bethel family does the same. 


05:45.865 --> 05:49.000
We have the morning worship program. 


05:50.745 --> 05:55.000
We also have 
the weekly Watchtower Study.


06:08.388 --> 06:10.931
These help to keep the family 


06:10.932 --> 06:12.957
spiritually strong. 


06:12.957 --> 06:16.000
They also help keep the family united.


06:23.737 --> 06:27.000
Some Bethelites work in offices.


06:35.497 --> 06:38.000
Others work in supportive departments.


07:32.638 --> 07:36.851
Regardless of what job we are assigned, 
why are we willing 


07:36.852 --> 07:40.000
and happy to be doing this work? 


07:42.065 --> 07:44.108
Because it is sacred service. 


07:44.108 --> 07:46.403
It helps to promote the furthering 


07:46.403 --> 07:48.738
of Kingdom interests and brings glory 


07:48.738 --> 08:09.613
and honor to our God, Jehovah.

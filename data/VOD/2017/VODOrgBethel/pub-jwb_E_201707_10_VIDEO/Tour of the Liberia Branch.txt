00:23 Welcome to Bethel.  Please come in.
00:30 The wonderful truths about Jehovah
00:33 and his purpose  have touched the hearts of millions
00:36 of people earth wide.
00:50 This has moved many  to visit the branch offices
00:53 of Jehovah’s Witnesses  in countries around the world.
01:06 Why are such branch offices necessary?
01:10 In order for life-giving truths  to reach everyone,
01:14 the preaching work
01:16 must be organized.
01:24 A Branch Committee oversees
01:27 all Bethel operations.
01:35 These brothers  also look after the preaching work
01:39 throughout the branch territory.
01:48 Our translation teams
01:50 translate articles and videos  into several local languages.
02:10 These are recorded  and made available on jw.org
02:14 or sent electronically for printing.
02:31 The activity of traveling overseers
02:33 as well as nearly 200 special pioneers  and missionaries
02:37 is coordinated by the Service Department.
02:43 These brothers also take care of organizing
02:46 the more than 130 congregations
02:49 throughout the branch territory.
02:58 With the growth of Kingdom interests,
03:01 comes a constant need  for more theocratic buildings.
03:08 The Local Design/Construction Department
03:11 cares for construction projects
03:13 such as Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.
03:43 It also cares for operating  and maintaining these buildings.
03:59 Jehovah’s Witnesses  have a deep respect for life
04:03 and want the best possible medical care.
04:05 The Hospital Information Desk
04:07 provides assistance  with nonblood medical management.
04:12 It coordinates  with Hospital Liaison Committees (HLC)
04:15 and cooperative doctors  around the country.
04:23 A lack of transport  and poor road conditions
04:26 make it really a challenge  for the HLC members
04:29 to travel around the country
04:31 to visit the hospitals and the clinics.
04:33 But their self-sacrificing spirit
04:35 and the love they have for the brothers,
04:37 along with some fine medical presentations,
04:40 have really had a positive effect  on many doctors and hospital staff,
04:44 who are now willing  to use nonblood treatment
04:47 in working with our brothers and sisters.
04:49 So we can honestly say  that we have seen
04:52 Jehovah’s rich blessing and direction  on the work of the HLC brothers.
05:12 All who live and work here
05:15 are part of what we call  the Bethel family.
05:18 We call it a family  because that is how we
05:22 truly feel about one another.
05:37 Just as you have  your family worship every week,
05:40 so the Bethel family does the same.
05:45 We have the morning worship program.
05:50 We also have  the weekly Watchtower Study.
06:08 These help to keep the family
06:10 spiritually strong.
06:12 They also help keep the family united.
06:23 Some Bethelites work in offices.
06:35 Others work in supportive departments.
07:32 Regardless of what job we are assigned,  why are we willing
07:36 and happy to be doing this work?
07:42 Because it is sacred service.
07:44 It helps to promote the furthering
07:46 of Kingdom interests and brings glory
07:48 and honor to our God, Jehovah.

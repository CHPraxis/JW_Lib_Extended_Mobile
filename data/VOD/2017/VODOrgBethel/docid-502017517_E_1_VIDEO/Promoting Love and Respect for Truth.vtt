00:04.191 --> 00:08.404
In today’s media, 
much of what’s presented as fact

00:08.404 --> 00:11.782
is often colored by emotion 
and personal opinion.

00:16.704 --> 00:19.123
Jehovah’s Witnesses, however,

00:19.123 --> 00:21.917
remain committed 
to defending God’s Word,

00:21.917 --> 00:24.587
the Bible, as the standard for truth.

00:24.587 --> 00:27.298
As Jesus said at John 17:17:

00:27.298 --> 00:29.049
“Your word is truth.”

00:30.426 --> 00:32.428
The wide-ranging subject matter

00:32.428 --> 00:35.389
contained in the publications 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:35.389 --> 00:39.310
is painstakingly researched 
by their Writing Research Department.

00:39.310 --> 00:42.897
Their research methods are modeled 
after that of Bible historians

00:42.897 --> 00:45.649
such as Luke and Jeremiah

00:45.649 --> 00:48.319
—reliance on reputable first-hand sources.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.282
We’re not looking just for someone’s opinions

00:53.282 --> 00:54.950
or what someone believes about a topic.

00:54.950 --> 00:56.952
If the material is socially

00:56.952 --> 00:59.079
or politically biased, for example,

00:59.079 --> 01:00.956
we can’t rely on it.

01:00.956 --> 01:02.541
We look for objective material.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.418
We cover everything

01:04.418 --> 01:07.963
from historical, scientific, geographical

01:07.963 --> 01:10.466
to flora, fauna, space.

01:10.466 --> 01:12.468
So before the script is even written,

01:12.468 --> 01:15.721
we’ll provide a research package,

01:15.721 --> 01:18.057
and we’ll follow
the project until final delivery

01:18.057 --> 01:20.059
to make sure
that everything that is said

01:20.059 --> 01:22.061
and everything that is shown

01:22.061 --> 01:23.562
is solidly based on fact

01:23.562 --> 01:24.813
and is well-researched.

01:24.813 --> 01:27.483
There’s a lot more research than what

01:27.483 --> 01:30.361
the viewer 
or the reader will ever see.

01:30.361 --> 01:32.613
You have a one-page article on the otter;

01:32.613 --> 01:34.490
you end up with like 12 references

01:34.490 --> 01:37.117
to back up every statement that’s made.

01:37.117 --> 01:38.285
It seems very simple,

01:38.285 --> 01:39.870
the height of Mont Blanc.

01:39.870 --> 01:41.664
And with the height of Mont Blanc,

01:41.664 --> 01:45.584
we found out, number one, 
that it was 4,807 meters;

01:45.584 --> 01:48.671
then we found another source
—4,810 meters;

01:48.671 --> 01:52.174
let’s check a third one
—4,808 meters.

01:52.174 --> 01:53.175
So, what is now real?

01:53.175 --> 01:55.386
In that case, we had to consult

01:55.386 --> 01:59.807
the French National Institute 
of Geographic and Forest Information.

02:00.683 --> 02:02.476
One of our main research tools

02:02.476 --> 02:04.687
is our own library system.

02:04.687 --> 02:09.066
We have about 65,000 books 
and other research materials.

02:10.401 --> 02:13.362
If we’re researching something 
about ancient history

02:13.362 --> 02:15.823
or archaeology,

02:15.823 --> 02:18.742
we may consult 
a specialized encyclopedia,

02:19.618 --> 02:23.163
like an encyclopedia 
of archaeological discoveries, for example.

02:23.163 --> 02:26.041
Museum websites usually have pictures

02:26.041 --> 02:27.751
of what they have in the museum.

02:27.751 --> 02:30.504
And we can find these visuals and then send 
those off to production teams

02:30.504 --> 02:33.048
as well and say, 
“This is a good example

02:33.048 --> 02:34.591
of a first-century lamp.”

02:34.591 --> 02:36.927
Things that you think are true

02:36.927 --> 02:39.471
because they are “commonly known”

02:39.471 --> 02:41.765
may not actually be totally accurate.

02:42.725 --> 02:44.935
Quotes need to be verified.

02:44.935 --> 02:48.480
We want to go to the first-hand source,

02:48.480 --> 02:50.482
the original source, for that quote.

02:50.482 --> 02:51.775
That’s one thing.

02:51.775 --> 02:56.071
And secondly, context matters; 
we want to quote things properly.

02:56.071 --> 03:00.409
When Gandhi and Lord Irwin came together,

03:00.409 --> 03:03.537
Gandhi said, ‘When your country 
and mine come together

03:03.537 --> 03:06.457
‘on the teachings of Christ 
and on the Sermon on the Mount,

03:06.457 --> 03:10.210
then we will have solved the problems 
of our countries and the world.’

03:10.210 --> 03:11.837
So we researched it.

03:11.837 --> 03:13.922
No one could confirm 
that those two men ever met.

03:14.590 --> 03:16.592
So it’s a great quote.

03:16.592 --> 03:18.969
Now, it doesn’t mean 
that he didn’t refer to Jesus

03:18.969 --> 03:22.347
or even the Sermon on the Mount, 
but that particular one, we couldn’t use.

03:22.347 --> 03:24.975
So the research work we’re doing,

03:24.975 --> 03:28.479
sometimes it takes a lot of time, 
a lot of effort.

03:28.479 --> 03:33.317
Sometimes we don’t find 
what we are expecting to find.

03:33.317 --> 03:37.362
But it’s very gratifying 
because we’re helping produce

03:37.362 --> 03:40.365
accurate information 
that our readers can rely on.

03:40.908 --> 03:43.994
Reliable information will help us 
make good informed decisions.

03:44.745 --> 03:47.456
Anyone who reads our journals 
and who sees our videos

03:47.456 --> 03:51.710
can be confident that this 
was thoroughly researched.

03:51.710 --> 03:54.171
These are facts; this is the truth.

03:54.171 --> 03:56.715
So when you consider 
the printed publications

03:56.715 --> 03:58.133
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

03:58.133 --> 04:01.178
or peruse the jw.org website,

04:01.178 --> 04:03.263
you can be confident that the material

04:03.263 --> 04:05.974
is carefully researched and accurate.

04:05.974 --> 04:07.559
Why?

04:07.559 --> 04:09.770
Because Jehovah’s Witnesses

04:09.770 --> 04:12.856
are a people who love and respect

04:12.856 --> 04:24.891
the truth.

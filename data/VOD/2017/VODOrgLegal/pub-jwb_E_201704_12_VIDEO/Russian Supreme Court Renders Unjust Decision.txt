00:02 We would like to welcome all of you
00:04 to a special broadcast
00:07 from the world headquarters
00:10 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:12 As you may have already heard,
00:14 yesterday, April 20,
00:17 the Supreme Court  of the Russian Federation
00:21 ruled against Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:25 and decided to liquidate
00:27 the Administrative Center  of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia
00:31 and all 395 Local Religious Organizations.
00:36 In essence, this means
00:40 that the properties  owned by the organization,
00:44 such as our Kingdom Halls  and our beautiful branch office,
00:49 have been unjustly confiscated
00:53 by the Russian government.
00:56 The ruling goes into effect immediately.
01:01 Our hearts go out to you  dear brothers and sisters in Russia,
01:06 but we know that you  deeply appreciate the support given to you
01:11 by the worldwide brotherhood.
01:13 Just think of how many letters  were sent to Russian officials
01:18 by your fellow worshippers  around the world!
01:21 Contemplate how many prayers
01:24 and supplications  were offered up to Jehovah
01:28 and will continue  to be made in your behalf!
01:32 Your confidence in Jehovah  warms our heart.
01:39 In just a moment,
01:41 we will be speaking  with Brother Mark Sanderson,
01:45 who was present in the courtroom
01:48 when the decision was announced.
01:51 However, before speaking with him,
01:54 we know you will be very interested
01:57 in this account  of the six days of proceedings
02:01 that led up  to this very disappointing decision.
02:06 The report includes comments  from a delegation of brothers
02:11 sent by the Governing Body  to meet with officials
02:15 and to be present
02:17 for portions of the trial.
02:24 The Governing Body  assigned me to come here,
02:27 not only for the trial
02:29 that’s to take place today,
02:31 but also to try
02:33 and see if we could do something
02:35 to encourage our brothers here  on a small scale.
02:38 When we arrived at the airport,  there was a large group of brothers.
02:43 Many of them  were of considerable size;
02:46 they just kind of shepherded us  through the airport.
02:49 We were standing there  with them for a few minutes,
02:51 and then one of the brothers  suddenly smiled,
02:54 and he said to me in Russian,  “Thank you so much for coming.”
03:23 The fundamental question in this case
03:25 is whether Jehovah’s Witnesses
03:27 are engaged in extremist activity
03:30 and whether the Administrative Center
03:33 is guilty of having organized  this extremist activity.
03:36 When it became known
03:38 that the Supreme Court of Russia  was considering a ban
03:41 on the worship of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
03:45 embassies from around the world requested
03:47 information as to what led up to this.
03:50 We were successful  in getting high-level meetings
03:53 with a number of different officials  at embassies here in Moscow,
03:57 and it’s really been quite impressive
03:59 to see the reaction  of these people in high station.
04:02 It impressed me  that so many of them were eager
04:07 to want to do something  within the limited sphere that they have.
04:12 And uniformly,
04:13 they are just amazed
04:15 that Jehovah’s Witnesses,  of all people,
04:17 are subject to criticism
04:20 or ban on the basis of being extremists.
04:24 Now, that comes across to them
04:26 as completely absurd  because if there’s one group
04:29 of people that’s known  for their neutrality,
04:31 it is Jehovah’s people.
04:34 Really,
04:36 now our eyes are poised toward the trial.
04:38 We’re getting ready to go to the court,
04:40 and we’ll wait and see  what’s going to happen.
04:45 As we were going to the court,  there were about 200
04:49 waiting to get into the courtroom,  mostly our brothers,
04:53 but then some who  were just interested in the hearing.
04:57 We could see the cameramen,  the microphones,
04:59 and the many reporters  who were there.
05:02 It was clear that this was now  an international event.
05:06 Just when we were  in the entranceway,
05:08 we stepped in  and here was a couple
05:12 that I had met  many years ago in Siberia.
05:15 And here they had come  all the way from Siberia
05:17 to testify in the hearing,  to be witnesses.
05:23 We had four different brothers  representing the Administrative Center.
05:27 Each one would take the lead  in arguing one motion.
05:30 The judge would listen  to what the brothers had to say,
05:33 turn to the Ministry of Justice,  and ask,
05:35 “Does the Ministry of Justice  have any input on this?”
05:39 The prosecutor would stand,
05:41 literally say two or three sentences,  sit down,
05:44 and the judge would say:
05:52 The brothers raised 20 motions
05:56 that they wanted the court to hear.
05:58 Of those 20 motions,
05:59 the court granted  only two of them to see how
06:04 evidence that would exonerate us
06:06 was not going  to be allowed in the hearing.
06:09 After seeing so many of them be dismissed,
06:11 then you began to say,
06:12 “Well, they really weren’t going
06:14 to take any of them seriously.”
06:16 For example,  the brothers were able to show clearly
06:20 that the congregations  that had been liquidated
06:23 were the result
06:24 of the planting of literature,  and that this was on video,
06:28 and that the Supreme Court  would refuse
06:31 to even see the video.
06:32 And that was really a lasting impression
06:35 that this was a little bit of a sham,
06:37 and it was designed
06:39 to go through the formalities,
06:42 but you got the sense that the decision
06:44 had already been taken.
06:47 At the hearing, representatives  from many embassies were there,
06:51 and as they listened to the court  hear whether local congregations
06:56 would be allowed to defend themselves
06:58 and to hear that the court said “no,”  they were not going to be heard,
07:02 these embassy representatives were appalled.
07:06 And I thought it was  quite interesting that when they saw
07:10 how ridiculous some of the rejections  of the motions were at the trial,
07:15 there was a murmur of laughter  in the audience,
07:18 particularly when the judge  cut off our lawyers
07:21 when they were presenting  the evidence of the planted publications.
07:27 This to them is evidence that it’s so absurd
07:31 that you haven’t got the real evidence
07:33 to bring a charge of extremism  so you plant evidence.
07:37 Although we were in the Supreme Court,
07:40 they don’t have  so many formalities in the court
07:43 as perhaps they have in other lands,
07:45 and so the brothers were allowed  to stand up and walk around.
07:49 To me it had more  the atmosphere of a circuit assembly
07:52 than being in a courtroom.
07:55 I think it made the charge
07:56 that’s been brought upon us
07:58 all the more absurd and ridiculous.
08:01 You know, just so many came up  and said how grateful they were
08:05 to feel the support from the Governing Body,
08:08 that they were not facing  this situation alone.
08:10 It occurred to me  that it was really a small thing
08:14 to travel here,
08:16 but for them,  it was symbolic.
08:19 They felt that the Governing Body  was there with them.
08:40 The decision has not been made.
08:42 We’ll have to wait and see.
08:44 The government  had only given us a six-day visa,
08:48 and so it was impossible  for us to stay any longer.
08:51 So our entire delegation,  of course,
08:54 with the exception of Brother Kalin,
08:56 we all had to leave the next day.
08:59 We had in our mind that we were going  to go and strengthen them,
09:02 but as is always the case,  I think we were the ones
09:04 who came away  even more strengthened
09:06 in our own faith.
09:09 One ten-year-old wrote this note  to the visiting delegation,
09:14 “Thank you for coming to support us
09:16 and for your ministry.”
09:18 —Sascha, ten years old, Moscow.
09:22 As we were leaving
09:24 and saying good-bye to these brothers,
09:27 there was not a dry eye among us.
09:30 They were hugging Brother Sanderson  and telling him,
09:33 “This is the spiritual high point  of my life.”
09:42 Something occurred in day two
09:45 that was unexpected and surprising to us.
09:47 Interestingly, the judge became very active,
09:50 and he began to really question
09:53 the Ministry of Justice.
09:55 Why are you bringing this case?
09:57 What evidence do you have
09:59 that they are engaged  in extremist activities?
10:51 The third day of the hearing reminded us
10:54 of Matthew 10:18.
10:55 “And you will be brought  before governors and kings for my sake.”
10:59 But then, what’s the reason?
11:01 It says,  “for a witness to them and the nations.”
11:06 The international community, worldwide,
11:08 has now heard the testimony
11:11 of six Jehovah’s Witnesses,  clearly, cogently,
11:14 convincingly explaining to the court
11:17 that we are law-abiding,  peaceful citizens
11:21 —the farthest thing from extremists.
11:22 For example, one longtime member  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
11:27 Vasiliy Kalin,  explained to the judge
11:29 that as a child, he had been forced  into exile with his parents
11:33 and was forced  to live in Siberia for years.
12:19 Decades later, he was exonerated
12:23 and cleared of all charges against him.
12:25 In Russia, he’s considered  or referred to as a rehabilitated person,
12:30 meaning that the charges  against him have now been expunged.
12:34 And now at this point in his life,  they’re saying he’s an extremist.
12:39 Anyone could see that the same efforts
12:43 that had been made  so long ago to try to hunt down
12:46 and wipe out Jehovah’s Witnesses
12:48 were just reappearing now  at this particular time.
12:57 I was texting with one  of the brothers at the Russia branch
13:00 asking how things were going.
13:02 He says: “Wow!
13:05 “They just announced that the court
13:08 “has been suspended  until Wednesday, April 12,
13:11 the day after the Memorial.”
13:13 And we were all just—
13:14 We could hardly believe it  that the court is ending on a Friday
13:18 but being postponed until Wednesday.
13:21 How wonderful!
14:22 We had an adjournment up until April 19.
14:26 That gives the brotherhood  in Russia the opportunity
14:29 to attend the special talk.
14:31 And that special talk is all about peace
14:34 —“How to Cultivate Peace in an Angry World.”
14:38 So we really hope to be  in the courtroom with our brothers
14:41 at the time  when the decision is issued,
14:44 even though it  would seem almost impossible
14:46 that we could get a visa  to return to Russia.
14:49 Basically,
14:50 we would have to make  application from Kazakhstan.
14:53 If Jehovah wills  and we are able to get the visa,
14:56 then Tuesday evening,  I’ll return to Russia
14:59 and then on Wednesday morning,  we will be in the court.
15:09 Brothers were hugging each other;
15:11 at lunchtime everybody was sharing  their sandwiches with each other.
15:14 The atmosphere of joy  and love was unforgettable.
15:20 The judge began  to go through all of the evidence,
15:23 and so there were
43 volumes of evidence
15:28 that had been brought forth  in the trial
15:30 either by the Ministry of Justice  or by our attorneys.
15:33 And so every one of those volumes
15:35 had to be reviewed.
15:38 And so it was kind of a long process.
15:41 Our attorneys were able
15:43 to ask the Ministry of Justice,
15:45 “Where is the evidence
15:47 “that funding from the Administrative Center
15:50 was used for any improper activities?”
15:56 And so the brothers came back:
15:57 “Well, tell me how much money?  how many rubles?
16:00 how many kopecks were spent  to fund this improper activity?”
16:04 And the ministry:
16:05 “Well we don’t have any;  we don’t have any information like that.”
17:18 I thought it was quite a surprise  to me that one single judge
17:21 could deliberate on six days of evidence
17:24 and within an hour come back and ban
17:27 a religion from practicing its faith.
17:30 When one part of the body suffers,  we all suffer,
17:34 and that will be the feeling  throughout the world, I’m sure.
17:37 We will allow Jehovah our God  to correct the injustices.
17:41 We will continue to be  peaceable with all men.
17:44 We will never  ‘return evil for evil to anybody.’
17:51 We have Brother Mark Sanderson
17:53 of the Governing Body tied in with us.
17:57 We’re so happy to have you with us, Mark.
18:00 And first,  we’d just like to thank you very much
18:03 for making the trip to Russia, Moscow,
18:08 to be with the brothers  during this critical time.
18:11 And we heard so many comments
18:14 about how much the brothers appreciated
18:16 having you there with them.
18:21 Oh, thank you so much, Steve.
18:23 You know, to stand unitedly  with our brothers in Russia
18:26 in that courtroom when they were facing
18:29 such a vicious attack on their worship  from the Devil
18:31 was a tremendous privilege.
18:33 I have to say, you know,  in all my years in serving Jehovah,
18:37 I don’t think I ever felt so proud  to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
18:41 as when I was standing in that courtroom.
18:43 Very encouraging, Mark.
18:46 But tell us, please, a little more
18:49 about what was  the reaction of the brothers
18:52 when they heard this negative decision?
18:57 Well, you know, Steve,
18:59 to understand their reaction,
19:01 I think we have to just kind of recap  with what’s been happening
19:03 because for the last couple of days,
19:06 there has been  such a joyful spirit in the courtroom.
19:09 The brothers and sisters  have been walking around,
19:12 greeting one another,
19:14 taking photographs, you know,
19:16 hugging one another, there’s just been  this tremendous, joyful feeling
19:20 within this courtroom.
19:23 And so then,  just before the decision was given,
19:25 we heard the closing statements  from our four attorneys
19:28 and also from Brother Sergey Cherepanov
19:31 and Brother Vasiliy Kalin
19:33 who are both  on the Branch Committee in Russia.
19:36 And, you know, these brothers  made such powerful statements;
19:40 their arguments were so compelling
19:43 that we all felt  just very pumped up by what they said.
19:47 And then, one of the statements  that several of these brothers made
19:51 was that really we’re not really standing
19:55 before the Russian Supreme Court
19:57 but really the Great Judge  of the universe, Jehovah,
20:00 is the one who’s judging all matters.
20:02 And they reminded everyone in that courtroom
20:05 that everyone is going to have to stand
20:08 before the judgment seat of God.
20:10 And when we heard that,
20:12 we all just felt  so inspired by those comments.
20:15 Well, then after a few moments
20:18 when the judge  actually issued his decision
20:21 and the brothers and sisters  heard that it was negative,
20:24 it was just totally silent  in the courtroom.
20:29 There was no outcry;  there was no comment.
20:32 Some of the brothers shook their head.
20:35 I think we were just all in total disbelief
20:38 that the judge could issue  such an unjust decision,
20:43 after hearing these tremendous arguments  from our brothers.
20:47 But I have to say,
20:49 although we were stunned  by the unjust decision
20:52 there was no hint in that courtroom
20:54 that our brothers are backing down,
20:57 that they’re cowering,
20:58 or that they’re going to give up  their service to Jehovah.
21:01 In fact,  you could see that they
21:03 were even strengthened by this decision
21:06 to go on serving Jehovah faithfully
21:08 under their new circumstances.
21:10 Those comments, Mark,
21:12 are so heartening to us to hear.
21:15 But even though  there was a negative decision,
21:19 how would you say
21:22 that a great shout of praise
21:24 has gone up to Jehovah’s name?
21:29 You know, Steve,  I just keep coming back
21:31 to what Jesus said at Matthew 10:18.
21:35 He said that we would  ‘be brought before kings and governors,
21:39 for a witness to them and to the nations.’
21:42 Well, that’s exactly what’s happened here.
21:45 We have been brought  before kings and governors.
21:48 But what a tremendous witness
21:51 has been given to them and to the nations!
21:53 For example,
21:54 we did this letter-writing campaign.
21:56 Our brothers participated  all around the world,
21:59 and then the news media  caught on to that,
22:02 and many newspapers  and other media outlets reported
22:06 on this tremendous effort
22:08 to write letters to the officials  of the Russian government.
22:11 Then the delegation that was sent  by the Governing Body to Moscow,
22:15 we were able to meet  with three different ambassadors
22:18 from the largest countries on this earth.
22:22 And these ambassadors  who are so difficult to meet with
22:25 welcomed us in;
22:27 they listened to us patiently;
22:29 and they showed that they had
22:31 a very deep respect for Jehovah’s Witnesses,
22:34 being very familiar with our work
22:36 and really wanting to do things  to help Jehovah’s people.
22:39 It was wonderful!
22:41 And then,  consider all the media coverage
22:43 that’s been taking place
22:45 on the court case  day after day after day.
22:49 And now,  we have a decision.
22:51 And so now this court decision  is going to be publicized
22:55 by the media  all over the world again.
22:58 And still to come,
23:00 we have our appeals that are going  to be made in the Russian Supreme Court,
23:03 in the European Court of Human Rights,  with the Human Rights Commission.
23:08 All of this is going  to result in more publicity.
23:12 And in the end,  really, what can we say?
23:15 Well, people who know Jehovah’s Witnesses
23:18 —people who have  Jehovah’s Witnesses as their neighbors,
23:21 as their workmates, as their schoolmates,
23:23 who really know who we are—
23:25 when they hear these reports,  they are going to immediately recognize
23:30 that these charges are ridiculous and absurd.
23:33 And they are perhaps even going  to want to ask questions
23:36 and perhaps even become interested  in the truth.
23:39 So even through this negative decision,
23:43 Jehovah’s name is being exalted  and glorified in all the earth.
23:47 That is so wonderful, Brother Sanderson,
23:50 what you’ve expressed.
23:52 And one thing  that we’re just so happy about
23:56 is that the brothers were able to celebrate
23:58 the Memorial of Christ’s death
24:02 before the negative decision was rendered.
24:05 I know many of us —I was praying and others—
24:08 were praying that if it be Jehovah’s will
24:11 —now of course,  we always want his will to take place—
24:14 but if it was his will,
24:15 that at least they  could celebrate the Memorial in peace.
24:19 And so that happened,  and we’re so happy.
24:23 Yes, that was my prayer too.
24:25 And, really,  when the decision was made
24:27 to adjourn the court  until the day after the Memorial,
24:30 you know, we really had  to see Jehovah’s hand in it
24:33 because across Russia now that  all of the reports have come in,
24:37 we understand that only in three cases
24:39 did the police come to a location
24:42 where the Memorial was being celebrated.
24:44 But even in those cases,
24:46 they did not attempt to disturb the occasion.
24:48 So we can say that our brothers
24:50 were able to celebrate the Memorial
24:53 all across Russia in peace.
24:55 And, of course,  even with the special talk,
24:58 because again the court adjourned,
24:59 the special talk was also held  across Russia in peace.
25:03 And so in a mighty way,
25:05 Jehovah stood by his people and allowed them to have
25:08 these two very important spiritual occasions
25:11 before this decision.
25:13 We thank Jehovah for that blessing.
25:16 We thank you, Mark,
25:19 for those very encouraging comments,
25:21 and we thank you again  for representing the Governing Body
25:26 there in Russia  and supporting the brothers.
25:29 We really appreciate it.
25:31 And please,  travel home safely.
25:37 Thank you so much, Steve.
25:38 It was such a wonderful privilege
25:41 to be able to be in Russia  with our dear brothers
25:43 at this historic moment.
25:45 I look forward to seeing you when I return.
25:50 And we would like to thank
25:52 all of you for your support.
25:56 You dear brothers and sisters  gave heartfelt prayers;
26:00 you willingly supported  the letter-writing campaign.
26:04 For some of you,  sending a letter
26:06 to one or more  of the six Russian officials
26:09 came at a great expense.
26:12 We commend you
26:14 for your strong love  for your brothers in Russia
26:17 and for your loyalty  to Jehovah’s organization.
26:22 But does the Supreme Court’s decision  against us
26:26 mean that the letter-writing campaign failed
26:29 or that Jehovah did not hear our prayers?
26:33 Absolutely not!
26:36 It simply means  that we have yet to see
26:40 how Jehovah will maneuver events  in harmony with his will.
26:45 In the meantime,  we are confident
26:48 that our dear brothers and sisters in Russia
26:52 will remain steadfast
26:54 and that Psalm 112:7, 8
26:58 will be true of them.
27:00 There it says of Jehovah’s righteous one:
27:04 “He will not fear bad news.
27:08 “His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.
27:14 “His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid;
27:20 “in the end
27:22 he will look in triumph on his adversaries.”
27:29 As long as we’re still living  in this old system,
27:33 as we have seen in Russia  and many other lands,
27:37 we can expect persecution
27:40 for simply wanting  to worship Jehovah in peace.
27:45 But do we need to fear such persecution?
27:48 No!
27:50 Jesus Christ and the heavenly armies
27:53 are ready to take the lead  in defending Jehovah’s people.
27:59 We can rest assured
28:01 that according to Isaiah 54:17:
28:04 “No weapon formed against [us]
28:07 will have any success.”
28:10 And why?
28:12 Because Jehovah is on our side.
28:18 May we all continue to pray
28:21 for our dear brothers and sisters in Russia
28:25 whom we love very much.
28:29 This is JW Broadcasting
28:34 from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

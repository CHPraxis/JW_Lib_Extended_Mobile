00:05.688 --> 00:07.690
Before I started pioneering, 


00:07.690 --> 00:11.393
I was really nervous that I wouldn’t be able 
to get my time in every month.


00:11.393 --> 00:15.365
It was a bit hard when I started pioneering 
because I didn’t have a car.


00:15.365 --> 00:18.768
My boss, 
he didn’t give me part-time work.


00:18.768 --> 00:21.070
I found it really hard 
to balance schoolwork 


00:21.070 --> 00:23.138
and pioneering 
at the same time.


00:23.138 --> 00:26.475
My biggest struggle was fear of man, 
so that really hindered me 


00:26.475 --> 00:28.778
because I wasn’t very good 
at talking to people.


00:28.778 --> 00:31.680
Having a good routine was a struggle.


00:31.680 --> 00:35.318
My brother and I are 
the only ones in the truth. 


00:35.318 --> 00:37.653
My family didn’t understand 


00:37.653 --> 00:40.490
why we wanted to go preaching.


00:40.490 --> 00:42.725
I didn’t think 
that I’d make a good pioneer.


00:42.725 --> 00:45.628
I’ve had Type 1 diabetes 
since I was five. 


00:45.628 --> 00:48.765
So I was always worried 
about whether or not 


00:48.765 --> 00:51.233
I could balance that health condition 
with pioneering.


00:51.233 --> 00:54.703
The challenges 
don’t seem that big now, 


00:54.703 --> 00:57.440
but back at that time 
they were a really big deal. 


00:57.440 --> 01:00.110
But the coolest thing 
was how Jehovah helped me.


01:00.110 --> 01:03.078
Prayer to Jehovah 
helped me overcome my fears.


01:03.078 --> 01:06.181
My family was 
a massive help from Jehovah. 


01:06.182 --> 01:09.052
Because my dad was the one 
who first encouraged me to pioneer, 


01:09.052 --> 01:12.455
when I did start pioneering, 
he promised that I would have 


01:12.455 --> 01:14.357
the full support of my family.


01:14.357 --> 01:18.327
When I spoke to brothers and sisters 
who spent their youth 


01:18.327 --> 01:20.997
in the full-time service 
that really helped me


01:20.997 --> 01:24.267
because it was really encouraging, 
and it really motivated me 


01:24.267 --> 01:26.870
to want to make my own memories 
and my own experiences 


01:26.870 --> 01:28.772
in the full-time service.


01:28.772 --> 01:31.007
So there were 
practical things I could do. 


01:31.007 --> 01:34.377
I didn’t have a car; 
I just walked or I caught the bus.


01:34.377 --> 01:37.014
I had to work out 
what my priorities were first. 


01:37.013 --> 01:41.150
So I had to find out how many hours 
would I have to go witnessing every week. 


01:41.150 --> 01:43.285
So then I just sat down 
and I looked at every day 


01:43.285 --> 01:45.288
and planned out which days 
I could go witnessing, 


01:45.288 --> 01:47.290
which days I had to go to school, 


01:47.290 --> 01:50.393
and also allocated time 
so that I could do my homework and study.


01:50.393 --> 01:52.161
Having a schedule 
was really good 


01:52.162 --> 01:54.164
because I could see it 
all out in front of me,


01:54.163 --> 01:56.165
and I could see 
that the hour requirement 


01:56.165 --> 01:59.035
was actually attainable, 
so that made it a lot less daunting.


01:59.035 --> 02:03.238
I first set short-term goals of pioneering 
in the special months of activity. 


02:03.238 --> 02:06.843
Then I was able 
to begin continuous auxiliary, 


02:06.843 --> 02:09.611
and then eventually 
I started regular pioneering.


02:09.612 --> 02:12.849
One of the best things I did 
to prepare myself for pioneering 


02:12.848 --> 02:14.950
was to auxiliary pioneer beforehand. 


02:14.950 --> 02:17.587
It really set me up 
to be able to overcome 


02:17.587 --> 02:20.624
any challenges 
that I faced while I was pioneering.


02:20.623 --> 02:23.258
I thought about Malachi 3:10. 


02:23.258 --> 02:25.261
I knew I trusted in Jehovah, 


02:25.262 --> 02:27.797
but this was my chance 
to test him out.


02:27.797 --> 02:30.434
I prayed, 
put my trust in Jehovah, 


02:30.433 --> 02:32.468
and put my application in.


02:32.468 --> 02:35.036
After my form 
was in for pioneering, 


02:35.037 --> 02:38.307
a brother, with time, 
a brother called me and offered me work.


02:38.307 --> 02:41.477
I had unemployment 
for three months, 


02:41.477 --> 02:44.747
which wasn’t a good time. 


02:44.747 --> 02:48.050
But during that time, 
I had Jehovah as my main focus. 


02:48.050 --> 02:51.387
And so he supported me, 
and he didn’t let me down.


02:51.387 --> 02:53.389
Asking brothers and sisters to come 


02:53.388 --> 02:55.458
and work with me, 
maybe on days that I knew 


02:55.458 --> 02:57.726
that I wouldn’t get as much support, 
really helped. 


02:57.727 --> 03:00.764
That helped me to organize 
my hours a little bit more, 


03:00.763 --> 03:04.033
and also I’d get to know 
my brothers and sisters more as well.


03:04.033 --> 03:07.836
One of the greatest joys of pioneering 
has been to pioneer with Mum. 


03:07.837 --> 03:10.407
And we had the privilege of going 


03:10.407 --> 03:13.109
to the pioneer school together, 
which was really special.


03:13.108 --> 03:16.145
Psalm 16:8 reminds me 


03:16.145 --> 03:19.215
that Jehovah is right beside me. 


03:19.215 --> 03:23.418
When I’m preaching, 
it’s like Jehovah is holding my hand.


03:23.418 --> 03:27.523
So with full-time service, 
I love making Jehovah happy. 


03:27.523 --> 03:31.260
With everything that he has given me, 
I’m finally able to give something back.


03:31.260 --> 03:33.128
Looking back
—pioneering—


03:33.128 --> 03:34.963
it was the best decision 
I’ve ever made. 


03:34.963 --> 03:37.000
It’s opened up 
so many different avenues 


03:37.000 --> 03:38.835
of service to Jehovah, 


03:38.835 --> 03:40.837
and it helped me also 
to have that real desire 


03:40.837 --> 03:43.339
to want to stay 
in full-time service.


03:43.338 --> 03:46.910
Helping someone 
on the road to everlasting life, 


03:46.910 --> 03:50.000
it’s the best feeling ever; 
and it’s really irreplaceable.


03:52.915 --> 03:55.318
The only thing I can say, 


03:55.318 --> 04:08.281
“As a young person, start pioneering!”

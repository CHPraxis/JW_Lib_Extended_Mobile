00:05 Sometimes I get words  mixed up and backwards,
00:07 so it can be kind of challenging.
00:09 So do I like reading?
00:11 Not really.
00:13 I don’t know.
00:13 I find books not interesting and boring.
00:17 You know, I just get completely distracted.
00:19 I have to mentally prepare myself to read
00:22 because there are so many things  you could be doing.
00:26 I don’t enjoy reading,  but I do like reading the Bible.
00:30 For me,  it’s more than a book.
00:36 It’s definitely worth it.
00:38 Some people may say  it’s not relevant for today.
00:40 But when you do look into it,
00:42 there are things
00:43 you can learn from all the time.
00:45 It’s helped me to think before I speak.
00:48 I find that I’m actually more concerned  with other people
00:50 —their well-being, how they’re doing,  and looking out for them.
00:54 I think Bible reading  has made me a better person.
00:56 It gives me a little push for the day.
01:00 My favorite book in the Bible  would probably be the Psalms
01:02 because it’s easy  for me to understand
01:05 and it’s really interesting to me.
01:07 The young people,  they can go through jw.org
01:10 and get the Bible
01:11 —several different copies of the Bible— right there.
01:13 We’ll type in the certain—
01:15 that certain scripture  and there’ll be articles about it.
01:20 Another thing I’m loving is the new videos
01:24 —an introduction to this book of the Bible.
01:27 It just takes two or three minutes
01:30 and you can understand  what you’re about to read
01:33 —that book— and that makes a huge difference.
01:35 I go by topics or what interests me.
01:38 I look for something that’s interesting,
01:42 that’s very—  that touches me directly;
01:45 it just becomes an enjoyable process.
01:47 It’s very, very relevant,  and it’s very important.
01:49 And you can find happiness.
01:51 I mean, who doesn’t want that?

00:05.985 --> 00:07.653
Sometimes I get words 
mixed up and backwards, 


00:07.653 --> 00:09.655
so it can be kind of challenging. 


00:09.655 --> 00:11.657
So do I like reading? 


00:11.657 --> 00:13.034
Not really.


00:13.033 --> 00:13.783
I don’t know. 


00:13.783 --> 00:17.830
I find books not interesting and boring.


00:17.830 --> 00:19.998
You know, I just get completely distracted.


00:19.998 --> 00:22.041
I have to mentally prepare myself to read 


00:22.042 --> 00:25.000
because there are so many things 
you could be doing.


00:26.922 --> 00:30.885
I don’t enjoy reading, 
but I do like reading the Bible. 


00:30.885 --> 00:33.000
For me, 
it’s more than a book.


00:36.015 --> 00:38.267
It’s definitely worth it.


00:38.267 --> 00:40.937
Some people may say 
it’s not relevant for today.


00:40.937 --> 00:42.395
But when you do look into it, 


00:42.395 --> 00:43.647
there are things 


00:43.647 --> 00:45.524
you can learn from all the time.


00:45.523 --> 00:48.610
It’s helped me to think before I speak.


00:48.610 --> 00:50.988
I find that I’m actually more concerned 
with other people


00:50.988 --> 00:54.325
—their well-being, how they’re doing, 
and looking out for them.


00:54.325 --> 00:56.952
I think Bible reading 
has made me a better person.


00:56.952 --> 01:00.289
It gives me a little push for the day.


01:00.288 --> 01:02.625
My favorite book in the Bible 
would probably be the Psalms 


01:02.625 --> 01:05.252
because it’s easy 
for me to understand 


01:05.252 --> 01:07.755
and it’s really interesting to me.


01:07.755 --> 01:10.423
The young people, 
they can go through jw.org 


01:10.423 --> 01:11.425
and get the Bible


01:11.425 --> 01:13.343
—several different copies of the Bible—
right there.


01:13.343 --> 01:15.553
We’ll type in the certain— 


01:15.553 --> 01:20.016
that certain scripture 
and there’ll be articles about it.


01:20.017 --> 01:24.605
Another thing I’m loving is the new videos


01:24.605 --> 01:27.900
—an introduction to this book of the Bible. 


01:27.900 --> 01:30.693
It just takes two or three minutes 


01:30.693 --> 01:33.155
and you can understand 
what you’re about to read


01:33.155 --> 01:35.823
—that book—
and that makes a huge difference.


01:35.823 --> 01:38.743
I go by topics or what interests me.


01:38.743 --> 01:42.455
I look for something that’s interesting, 


01:42.455 --> 01:45.125
that’s very— 
that touches me directly; 


01:45.125 --> 01:47.085
it just becomes an enjoyable process.


01:47.085 --> 01:49.963
It’s very, very relevant, 
and it’s very important. 


01:49.963 --> 01:51.965
And you can find happiness. 


01:51.965 --> 02:05.625
I mean, who doesn’t want that?

00:01 We wanted to share a portrayal of life
00:03 as a Witness back in the early 1900’s.
00:06 This unique dramatization
00:09 about the endurance needed  as a Kingdom proclaimer
00:12 was previously shown to delegates  at some international conventions
00:16 held in one city in 2014.
00:19 This is a gift video that we received.
00:21 The title is  Knock! Knock!
06:35 Where are the dead?
06:37 Would you wish that question  answered according to man’s theory
06:41 or to have the answer  as pointed out in the Bible?
06:44 You will say that man’s answer  would be only a guess.
06:47 And yet there is no truth  more clearly taught in the Bible
06:51 than that of the resurrection of the dead.
06:54 If the dead are to live again,
06:57 then they must be resurrected,

07:31 “And God shall wipe away  all tears from their eyes;
07:33 “and there shall be no more death,
07:35 “neither sorrow, nor crying,  neither shall there be any more pain:
07:38 for the former things are passed away.”
07:42 The resurrection  will bring boundless joy to those
07:46 who obey God under Christ’s Kingdom.
07:48 The obedient ones on earth  during the reign of Christ
07:52 will be given everlasting life on the earth  in complete happiness and joy.
07:58 Jehovah’s way is always right and true.
08:01 Learn that way and live.
08:09 The word “resurrection”  means “a standing up again” to life.
08:13 If, as claimed by the clergy,
08:15 the dead are alive in purgatory  or some other place,
08:18 then it follows  that there could be no resurrection;
08:21 and yet there is no truth more clearly taught  in the Bible than that of the . . .

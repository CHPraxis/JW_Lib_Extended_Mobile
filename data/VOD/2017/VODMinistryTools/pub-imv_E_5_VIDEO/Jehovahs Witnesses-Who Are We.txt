00:03 Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:07 We come from hundreds of ethnic
00:09 and language backgrounds,
00:12 yet we share common beliefs and goals.
00:15 We worship Jehovah,
00:17 the God of the Bible  and the Creator of all things.
00:21 We are Christians,
00:24 so we follow the teachings  and example of Christ Jesus.
00:28 Like Jesus, we strive  to be honest, peaceful,
00:31 law-abiding citizens  of the land where we live.
00:36 Even more important,
00:39 we all follow Jesus’ example  by regularly spending time
00:42 helping people learn  about the Bible and God’s Kingdom.
00:46 Because we witness, or talk,  about Jehovah God
00:50 and his Kingdom,  we are known as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:54 Each week,  we meet together at Kingdom Halls
00:57 to learn about God  and his Word, the Bible.
01:00 Our meetings are free  and open to the public.
01:03 We welcome you to visit us.

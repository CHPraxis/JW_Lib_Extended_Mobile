Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses?


00:07.232 --> 00:09.417
We come from hundreds of ethnic 


00:09.417 --> 00:12.067
and language backgrounds, 


00:12.067 --> 00:15.215
yet we share common beliefs and goals.


00:15.215 --> 00:17.658
We worship Jehovah, 


00:17.658 --> 00:21.416
the God of the Bible 
and the Creator of all things.


00:21.417 --> 00:24.212
We are Christians, 


00:24.212 --> 00:28.350
so we follow the teachings 
and example of Christ Jesus.


00:28.350 --> 00:31.990
Like Jesus, we strive 
to be honest, peaceful, 


00:31.990 --> 00:36.265
law-abiding citizens 
of the land where we live.


00:36.265 --> 00:39.227
Even more important, 


00:39.227 --> 00:42.699
we all follow Jesus’ example 
by regularly spending time 


00:42.698 --> 00:46.358
helping people learn 
about the Bible and God’s Kingdom.


00:46.358 --> 00:50.356
Because we witness, or talk, 
about Jehovah God 


00:50.357 --> 00:54.665
and his Kingdom, 
we are known as Jehovah’s Witnesses.


00:54.665 --> 00:57.798
Each week, 
we meet together at Kingdom Halls 


00:57.798 --> 01:00.496
to learn about God 
and his Word, the Bible.


01:00.497 --> 01:03.792
Our meetings are free 
and open to the public. 


01:03.792 --> 01:06.337
We welcome you to visit us. 


01:06.337 --> 01:08.380
To find a Kingdom Hall near you, 


01:08.380 --> 01:10.757

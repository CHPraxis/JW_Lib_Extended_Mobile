00:01 Jesus came to “bear witness to the truth.”
00:06 Standing on trial before the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate,
00:11 Jesus boldly stated,
00:14 as recorded at John 18:37:
00:17 “For this I have come into the world,
00:20 “that I should bear witness to the truth.
00:24 “Everyone who is on the side of the truth
00:27 listens to my voice.”
00:31 Jesus used his three-and-a-half year ministry on earth
00:35 to teach people the truth
00:38 about Jehovah God and His purpose.
00:41 Those who were “on the side of the truth”
00:44 responded favorably and wanted to learn more.
00:49 Others, however, by their response to the good news,
00:53 revealed themselves to be enemies of the truth.
00:59 As Jesus neared the end of his earthly ministry,
01:03 he ‘bore witness to the truth’ during a series
01:07 of dramatic confrontations in the temple.
01:13 What lessons can we learn from the exciting events recorded
01:17 in Matthew chapters 21 and 22?
01:22 As we will see,
01:24 these two chapters of Matthew highlight Jesus’ courage,
01:30 his masterful teaching ability,
01:33 and his persistence in bearing  thorough witness to the truth.
01:38 Studying these chapters
01:40 will help us to imitate Jesus’ fine qualities.
01:45 Let us begin with Matthew chapter 21.
01:50 Verses 12 to 14 relate how Jesus
01:53 threw out those selling and buying animals in the temple
01:58 and overturned the tables of the money changers.
02:04 These events took place on Nisan 10, 33 C.E.
02:10 The next day,
02:11 the chief priests directly challenged Jesus’ authority
02:15 to disrupt their business.
02:18 How would he respond?
02:20 Let us start the reading at verse 23:
07:29 In challenging Jesus with the words in verse 23,
07:35 “By what authority do you do these things?
07:39 And who gave you this authority?”
07:43 the chief priests and elders showed gross disrespect for Jehovah,
07:48 his temple,  and his inspired Word of truth.
07:53 Jesus boldly countered their challenge
07:56 with a question that left them speechless,
08:01 for it exposed them
08:03 as treacherous and calculating.
08:07 Before they could recover,
08:09 Jesus followed up with two illustrations.
08:13 First, he compared the religious leaders
08:16 to a rebellious son.
08:19 They had made a promise to do God’s will
08:22 but had not kept it.
08:25 Next, Jesus denounced them
08:28 as wicked caretakers of Jehovah’s “vineyard”
08:32 who would be held responsible for their failure
08:36 to cultivate the “fruitage” of faith in God’s Son.
08:42 Jesus’ illustrations were so masterful
08:46 that the chief priests and elders
08:49 unwittingly pronounced judgment on themselves.
08:56 The religious leaders were furious,
08:59 and they would have tried to kill Jesus but they feared the crowds.
09:04 So they took the indirect approach
09:07 and conspired to trap Jesus in his speech.
09:11 How would Jesus handle this new challenge?
09:16 Please turn your attention
09:18 to Matthew 22:15-33:
12:37 Jesus was approached first
12:40 by party followers of Herod and disciples of the Pharisees.
12:46 Although these two groups
12:48 held conflicting political and social views,
12:51 they were united in their hatred for Jesus.
12:57 Flattering words prefaced
13:00 a dangerous question:
13:03 “Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?”
13:09 Had Jesus answered,  “Yes, it is lawful,”
13:13 he could have enraged the crowd,
13:15 for many would have felt that he was condoning the injustices
13:20 they suffered at the hands of the Romans.
13:24 On the other hand, a response such as,
13:27 “It is not lawful,”
13:30 could have sparked a revolt,
13:33 resulting in Jesus’ immediate arrest for sedition.
13:39 Jesus did not fall into either trap.
13:44 Instead, using a coin,
13:47 he responded with an object lesson that amazed his questioners.
13:53 Next, the Sadducees, intending to discredit Jesus,
13:57 proposed a scenario
14:00 that they thought would expose belief in the resurrection
14:04 as foolishness.
14:07 In response, Jesus used flawless reasoning
14:11 to highlight Scriptural evidence
14:13 that the Sadducees had apparently  never considered before.
14:19 They professed to believe the words of Jehovah recorded at Exodus 3:6:
14:24 “I am . . . the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
14:28 and the God of Jacob.”
14:31 When Jehovah spoke those words,
14:33 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had long since died.
14:38 Yet, Jehovah said “I am” their God,
14:42 not “I was” their God.
14:46 By speaking of these long-dead patriarchs
14:49 as though they were still alive,
14:51 Jehovah showed that his purpose to resurrect his faithful servants
14:55 is sure of fulfillment.
15:00 Additionally,  Jesus told the Sadducees
15:03 that “in the resurrection neither do men marry
15:07 nor are women given in marriage,
15:10 but they are as angels in heaven.”
15:13 He may have been using the opportunity
15:16 to reveal truths about the heavenly resurrection
15:19 for the benefit of sincere disciples
15:22 who would one day be in line to receive
15:26 such a resurrection.
15:29 The crowds were astounded
15:31 at Jesus’ authoritative teaching from the Scriptures.
15:38 Finally, the Pharisees and Sadducees joined forces
15:44 to test Jesus one last time.
15:48 A scribe from among them, “versed in the Law,”
15:52 presented a deceptively simple question,
15:56 namely: “Which is the greatest commandment?”
16:02 In Jesus’ day, this was a hotly debated question.
16:07 Would Jesus say something in answer that would damage his credibility?
16:12 Let us listen
16:14 to Matthew 22:34-46
16:18 to learn from Jesus’ response.
16:21 That’s Matthew 22, beginning with verse 34:
18:46 Quoting from God’s Word,
18:49 Jesus captured the essence of true worship—love.
18:55 The Mosaic Law consisted of more than 600 individual laws
19:00 and regulations,
19:01 yet Jesus —without hesitation—
19:05 selected the two commandments  on which “the whole Law hangs.”
19:11 The clear truth of his answer
19:14 cut through human tradition and empty debate.
19:19 Jesus then turned the tables  on his opposers with this question:
19:25 ‘If the Christ is to be a “son of David,”
19:28 then why does David refer to him in the psalms as “my Lord”?’
19:34 More than a mere riddle,
19:36 this question uncovered the spiritual ignorance
19:40 of Jesus’ enemies.
19:43 Exposed as spiritually blind,
19:45 his opposers
19:47 never dared to question Jesus again.
19:53 How can we follow Jesus’ example
19:56 in bearing witness to the truth?
19:59 First, by imitating his courage.
20:04 Jesus’ courage was based on faith in God.
20:08 We grow in faith by praying for holy spirit,
20:13 by meditating on Bible accounts that highlight
20:16 the courageous acts of God’s servants,
20:19 and by allowing what we learn at Christian meetings
20:23 to sink into our hearts.
20:26 Doing this enables us to build strong faith
20:30 on the foundation of truth.
20:35 Another way that we can follow Jesus’ example
20:38 in bearing witness to the truth
20:40 is by imitating his masterful teaching.
20:46 We can reach the hearts of sincere listeners with the truth
20:50 by imitating Jesus’ use of questions,
20:54 illustrations, and object lessons
20:59 as well as his reasoning
21:01 and skillful use of God’s written Word.
21:06 Third,  we are following Jesus’ example
21:10 when we persevere in our efforts to bear thorough witness.
21:16 Never give up in preaching and teaching the good news;
21:21 those who reject the truth at first may respond later.
21:26 The inspired record in Acts of Apostles tells us
21:30 that in time
21:32 thousands of Jews began paying attention
21:35 to the good news that had been preached by Jesus,
21:39 including “a large crowd of priests”
21:44 and some who had been Pharisees.
21:49 These no longer acted in ignorance.
21:52 Rather, they repented and gained Jehovah’s favor.
21:58 So whether you are facing direct challenges
22:01 or indirect ones,
22:04 be determined to bear witness to the truth,
22:07 as Jesus did.

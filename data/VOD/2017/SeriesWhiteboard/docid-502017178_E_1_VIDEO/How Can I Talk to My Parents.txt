00:03 When you were younger,
00:05 your parents were probably the first ones
00:07 you ran to for advice.
00:13 But now you might feel  that your parents
00:15 just don’t understand you.
00:18 Deep down,  you still want to talk to them.
00:22 But what if you try,
00:24 and you feel  they just aren’t listening?
00:27 Well, you could raise your voice,
00:29 but shouting won’t make
00:31 your parents more receptive
00:33 and won’t show them  the respect they deserve.
00:35 You could give your parents
00:37 the silent treatment,
00:39 but the Bible suggests  at Proverbs 15:22
00:42 that things only get more frustrating
00:44 when you don’t talk.
00:46 So saying nothing
00:48 really gets you nowhere.
00:49 It’s smarter to just wait
00:51 for a better time to talk.
00:54 Or you might even write them
00:56 an honest but respectful letter
00:58 expressing how you feel.
01:01 But what if the situation is flipped?
01:03 Yeah, that’s right.
01:05 Your parents want to talk,
01:06 but you don’t.
01:08 Maybe you had a bad day at school.
01:11 It’s true that choosing to talk
01:13 when you don’t feel like it could mean
01:15 the conversation will be forced,
01:17 which makes everyone tense
01:19 and leads to poor communication.
01:22 But refusing to talk
01:24 means you’ll still be stressed,
01:26 and your parents might think
01:28 that the problem is bigger than it is,
01:30 or worse,  that you’re hiding something.
01:33 Instead, you could start off  talking with them
01:35 on a subject that isn’t as stressful
01:38 or even one that makes you happy.
01:40 That will ease the tension
01:43 or get rid of it all together.
01:46 The bottom line:
01:48 Your parents want to help you
01:50 and you can use their help.
01:53 So choose your words carefully,
01:56 deliver them respectfully,
01:58 and think of your parents as friends,
02:00 not enemies.
02:03 Because let’s face it,
02:05 you’ll need all the allies  you can get to cope
02:07 with the challenges that lie ahead.

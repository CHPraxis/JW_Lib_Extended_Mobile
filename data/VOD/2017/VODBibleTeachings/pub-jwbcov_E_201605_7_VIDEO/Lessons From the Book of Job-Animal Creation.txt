00:06 Observers find it difficult
00:08 even to get  near the nimble mountain goat.
00:15 What accounts for this?
00:20 Their hooves  are designed with two toes
00:23 that can be spread wide apart.
00:37 This feature enables  mountain goats to run, jump,
00:41 and feed between narrow ledges.
00:48 They can maintain their footing
00:51 on a near-vertical incline.
00:55 Researchers have tried  to apply these design features
00:58 to advanced footwear,  with only limited success.
01:17 A horse can gallop at speeds
01:19 up to 50 kilometers  [or 30 miles] per hour.
01:24 Even more impressive  is how efficiently
01:27 the horse expends energy.
01:29 The secret is in its legs.
01:34 Like a spring,  a horse’s leg absorbs energy.
01:39 As its leg leaves the ground,  that energy is released.
01:45 Specialized muscles  act as shock absorbers.
01:49 Engineers are trying  to imitate this design
01:52 but are finding it a challenge.
02:19 During an eagle’s flight,
02:21 the feathers  on the tips of its wings
02:24 are practically vertical.
02:28 This configuration  gives maximum lift
02:32 with minimum wing length.
02:34 Engineers have studied  such soaring birds as eagles
02:37 with a view to designing  more efficient aircraft.
02:41 The introduction  of modified wing design
02:45 that includes winglets
02:47 has improved aircraft performance  by as much as 15 percent.
02:52 Planes can now fly farther  and carry more
02:56 while saving fuel.
02:58 In the decade following  the introduction of upturned wingtips,
03:02 airlines worldwide  saved 7,600 million liters
03:07 [or 2 billion gallons] of jet fuel.
03:12 But the eagle’s amazing design  is not limited to flight.
03:17 As the eagle  descends upon its prey,
03:21 its eyes continuously adjust
03:23 to maintain sharp focus  throughout the approach.
03:31 What man-made camera  comes even close
03:34 to this ability  of rapid refocus?
03:56 The Behemoth mentioned in Job
03:58 is generally identified  as the hippopotamus.
04:03 A full-grown hippo  may be as large as 15 feet
04:06 [or 4 to 5 meters] long
04:09 and weigh around 8,000 pounds  [or 3,600 kilograms].
04:16 Its bones,  particularly the vertebrae,
04:19 form a strong, rigid structure.
04:21 Its ribs and thick hide protect it
04:24 as it navigates such areas  as rocky river beds.
04:31 You don’t have to have  bones like a hippo
04:33 to appreciate their strength.
04:38 Bone is an essential part  of countless living organisms.
04:56 Researchers say that bones are constructed  in exactly the same way
05:01 that reinforced concrete  is constructed.
05:04 The steel of reinforced concrete  provides the tensile strength,
05:09 while the cement, sand, and rock
05:13 provide the compressional strength.
05:18 However,  the compressional strength of bone
05:21 is greater than that of even  the best reinforced concrete.
05:27 Bone is superior to concrete  in many other ways.
05:31 It responds to hormones  that affect its growth and development
05:35 and is even able to repair itself.
05:41 Also, like muscle,
05:43 it slowly grows stronger  as the load on it increases.
06:02 Leviathan,  likely the crocodile,
06:05 has an enormously  powerful bite.
06:09 Some have a bite  nearly three times more powerful
06:13 than that of a lion.
06:15 Yet, the crocodile’s jaw  is also more sensitive
06:20 than the human fingertip.
06:22 It is covered  with thousands of sense organs
06:26 that come out of holes  in the skull.
06:28 This design allows a mother  to pick up her babies
06:33 and gently carry them in her mouth.
06:55 Without a doubt,
06:57 God’s “invisible qualities
06:59 are clearly seen” in the things he made.
07:08 We can also learn much
07:10 from the other animal creation  mentioned in Job:
07:14 the wild bull,
07:18 the stork,
07:20 and the ostrich.
07:30 Why not study these animals  during family worship
07:34 and see what more can be learned
07:37 about Jehovah’s qualities?

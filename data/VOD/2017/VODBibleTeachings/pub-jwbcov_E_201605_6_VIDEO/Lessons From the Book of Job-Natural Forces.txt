00:09 In the Bible book of Job,
00:11 Jehovah described examples of his power
00:14 observable in the natural world.
00:18 Consider just a few.
00:23 Thunderhead clouds.
00:28 It is estimated that a single thunderstorm
00:31 can release more energy  than a 20-kiloton nuclear explosion.
00:40 We see some of that energy as lightning.
00:44 But lightning is only half the show.
00:49 Thunder is produced when lightning  heats up the surrounding air.
00:53 The superheated air rapidly expands,
00:56 causing a tremendous boom and crackling.
01:03 This is followed by rumbles,
01:05 as the air continues to vibrate.
01:09 Although usually associated  with destructive power,
01:12 lightning strikes can be very beneficial.
01:17 As lightning rips through the air,
01:19 nitrogen is converted
01:21 to a form that nourishes plants.
01:26 “Who . . . made a path  for the thunderous storm cloud?
01:30 “Can you send out lightning bolts?
01:32 Will they come and say to you, ‘Here we are!’”
01:45 Waves can start far out in the open sea.
01:51 They can begin as tiny ripples  formed by the wind.
01:57 As the wind continues to add energy,
01:59 the waves increase in size.
02:02 The stronger the wind and longer the gust,
02:05 the bigger the wave.
02:07 Hurricane winds can produce waves
02:10 of 100 feet or more in height.
02:29 Long after the wind stops,
02:31 the tremendous wave energy  continues to move.
02:36 It can travel great distances  from where it originated.
02:42 The amount of energy  contained in all the oceans
02:45 could theoretically power the entire globe
02:48 without air pollution.
02:54 “Who barricaded the sea behind doors  when it burst out from the womb,
02:58 “. . . when I established my limit for it  and put its bars and doors in place,
03:03 “and I said,  ‘You may come this far, and no farther;
03:07 here is where your proud waves will stop’?”
03:14 The evening sky.
03:20 Job could see familiar constellations.
03:24 What controls the motion of the stars?
03:29 Only thousands of years later did scientists
03:31 learn more about these invisible laws.
03:36 Today, we understand that the motion  of stars is controlled by gravity.
03:42 Although they are in motion,
03:44 we perceive their positions as fixed
03:46 because they are so far away.
03:51 Thus, they can serve  as reliable navigational markers
03:55 down to this day.
03:59 Yet, despite increasing knowledge
04:02 about the force of gravity,
04:04 humans are still unable  to give a complete answer
04:07 to the questions God posed to Job.
04:12 “Do you know the laws  governing the heavens,
04:15 or can you impose  their authority on the earth?”
04:22 All around us,
04:24 daily reminders
04:26 of Jehovah’s great power can be seen.
04:46 What do you see?

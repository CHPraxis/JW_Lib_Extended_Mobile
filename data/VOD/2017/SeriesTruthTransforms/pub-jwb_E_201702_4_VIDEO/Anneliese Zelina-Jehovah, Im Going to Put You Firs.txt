00:06 Growing up in the truth,
00:08 I felt like I fit in
00:10 more with my friends at school
00:12 or people who weren’t Witnesses.
00:15 I was living a double life  and I knew it.
00:17 I was not baptized.
00:20 I had always tried to make  the truth fit in with the world.
00:23 And this time I decided  that I just want to give
00:26 the world a shot  and see what that’s like.
00:28 I came right to my parents,  and I said,
00:30 “I want to move to LA  and pursue modeling.”
00:33 I had my first job within the week.
00:36 It looked so glamorous.
00:48 There were a lot of parties
00:50 —going to the coolest houses,  getting to hang out with celebrities.
00:56 There are no rules.
00:58 You have the money  to do whatever you want.
01:03 That lifestyle was so far  from what I was raised knowing as right
01:08 that I basically had  no relationship with Jehovah.
01:11 Once all the smoke  and mirrors are gone,
01:14 you see these things  for what they are.
01:16 I remember I called my mom,
01:18 and I told her:  “It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah.
01:20 I’m literally in the middle of it all.”
01:22 And I thought, like, this is it;
01:24 this is what everyone says is the best,  and I’m not happy.
01:26 And I just felt so dull —empty.
01:29 And I actually thought to myself:
01:31 ‘I wish— I wish I was never raised a Witness.
01:34 I wish I never even knew Jehovah existed.’
01:37 There were certain nights  where I needed Him.
01:40 I was thinking,  ‘Just pray; just go to him.’
01:43 And I couldn’t.
01:45 I thought I would never be able to come back to Jehovah.
01:53 One of the jobs  I got hired to do
01:55 was to work  for this young fashion company.
01:58 In between different outfits and shoots,  you would, you know,
02:01 talk with the photographer.
02:05 So, what are you guys  going to be for Halloween?
02:07 Matt doesn’t celebrate Halloween.
02:09 He’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:11 So am I.
02:13 It’s not a joke.
02:14 No, I’m not kidding.
02:16 I was raised as a Witness.
02:18 Yeah, I was raised as one as well.
02:19 Do you, um— do you go to meetings?
02:21 No, I haven’t been in forever.
02:23 What about you?
02:24 No, no, I haven’t.
02:27 I got a last-minute job to New York.
02:29 I decided to walk the Brooklyn Bridge.
02:32 I knew Bethel was there,  and I’d never been to Bethel.
02:35 This sister stopped me on my tour,  and she invited me up to her office.
02:40 There were different paintings  of the resurrection.
02:43 She asked me, “Do you know why  the people are waiting on the balcony?”
02:46 And I was like,  “I—I don’t know. Why?”
02:49 And she said, “Because they’re waiting  for their loved ones to be resurrected.”
02:56 It was as if something  just went straight to my heart.
02:59 I’ve never felt something like that.
03:02 I had for the first time actually seen  the resurrection and believed it.
03:06 It wasn’t just this thing that might happen —it was for sure.
03:09 I knew exactly  what it was going to look like.
03:11 I would be standing there  on that balcony
03:13 looking for my loved ones  to come back,
03:18 and I wanted to be there.
03:20 The resurrection was so real to me.
03:25 And the second I got out of Bethel,
03:27 I—I called my mom,  and I told her, and I said:
03:31 “Mom, Mom, I’m coming back.
03:36 “I know exactly what I need to do.
03:38 I’m coming back to Jehovah.”
03:42 I had made up my mind, you know,  I’m going to give Jehovah a chance.
03:46 But, you know,  I’m coming back to the truth.
03:48 I’m going to do it right.
03:50 There was an elder  who was doing the Watchtower,
03:53 and he just came off so kind
03:55 that I thought, you know,  when this meeting ends,
03:58 I want to talk with him, and I’m going  to explain to him why I’m here.
04:01 I knew I had so many changes to make.
04:03 Matthew 6:33 is so important to me,
04:06 ‘Seek first the Kingdom.’
04:09 My entire life I sought  everything else before Jehovah.
04:13 I never put him first,  and I for the first time was saying,
04:17 “OK, Jehovah, I’m going to put you first.”
04:20 The job I have right now  isn’t necessarily my dream job,
04:24 but it allows me to do exactly  what I want to do for Jehovah
04:27 —and that’s pioneer.
04:30 I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard
04:32 going from casting to casting  with my portfolio in hand,
04:35 and now I walk down Hollywood Boulevard  with the cart in my hand.
04:38 Out in the ministry,  I see models that I used to work with,
04:41 and I love getting to show  them that this is my new life,
04:44 and this has changed my life.
04:46 I am so happy.
04:47 I know what it’s like  to superficially feel good.
04:49 But to literally have the joy,  the happiness
04:54 —I want to share that with everybody.
05:00 Jehovah completely changed my life.

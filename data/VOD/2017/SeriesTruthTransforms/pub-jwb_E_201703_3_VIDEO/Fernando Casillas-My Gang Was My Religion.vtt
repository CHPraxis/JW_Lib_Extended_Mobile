00:01.150 --> 00:03.185
There is a saying  


00:03.185 --> 00:06.488
that experience 
is the best teacher, 


00:06.488 --> 00:08.991
but that is not 
really accurate. 


00:08.992 --> 00:13.000
Experience is often 
the hard way to learn. 


00:14.863 --> 00:19.635
Brother Fernando Casillas 
was born in Mexico, 


00:19.635 --> 00:21.838
but when he was a baby, 


00:21.838 --> 00:25.808
his family moved 
to the United States. 


00:25.808 --> 00:32.015
The neighborhood he grew up in 
had a lot of gang influence. 


00:32.015 --> 00:35.852
This had 
a very negative impact on him. 


00:35.852 --> 00:39.122
But despite these circumstances, 


00:39.122 --> 00:45.000
notice how the truth attracted him.


00:46.863 --> 00:50.500
I used to love violence; 
I dreamed of violence. 


00:50.500 --> 00:53.470
My gang was my religion. 


00:53.470 --> 00:56.338
I got into the prison system 
at a young age. 


00:56.338 --> 00:59.108
At first, they sent me 
to a juvenile facility, 


00:59.108 --> 01:01.410
but I got kicked out of there 
for a riot. 


01:01.410 --> 01:05.915
Basically, they deemed me a threat 
to the safety and security 


01:05.915 --> 01:09.085
of the institution, 
the guards, and other inmates. 


01:09.085 --> 01:11.287
And I was sent 
to solitary confinement 


01:11.287 --> 01:13.322
to finish off my prison term.


01:13.322 --> 01:15.625
Me thinking 
I was violent back then 


01:15.625 --> 01:18.000
was nothing compared to 
what I came out with. 


01:19.128 --> 01:21.230
Basically,
what you try to come out to be 


01:21.230 --> 01:24.933
is the best killer out of all.


01:24.933 --> 01:27.703
After my incarceration, 


01:27.703 --> 01:30.000
I was deported to Mexico. 


01:32.242 --> 01:34.510
I used to carry a weapon 
with me everywhere I went.


01:34.510 --> 01:38.247
After a while, we started getting involved 
with bad people.


01:38.247 --> 01:41.384
Eventually, 
my girlfriend got in trouble. 


01:41.383 --> 01:43.620
Once that was over, 


01:43.620 --> 01:45.622
she saw a Kingdom Hall. 


01:45.622 --> 01:47.624
My girlfriend had been 
to meetings as a child, 


01:47.623 --> 01:50.393
so she basically dragged me 
to the Kingdom Hall.


01:50.393 --> 01:52.395
They treated me nice. 


01:52.395 --> 01:55.132
And that’s when I started 
to get to know Omar. 


01:55.132 --> 01:57.634
So I started hanging around 
with him and his wife


01:57.633 --> 02:01.303
—me and my girlfriend at the time—
and going to meetings. 


02:01.303 --> 02:03.305
But it wasn’t till I found out 
this guy 


02:03.305 --> 02:05.442
used to be one of my rivals


02:05.442 --> 02:07.577
—I was very, very upset. 


02:07.577 --> 02:09.445
I felt betrayed because he never told me. 


02:09.445 --> 02:12.282
Everything that was going 
through my head was, 


02:12.282 --> 02:14.284
‘I’ve got to find a way to get him over here, 


02:14.283 --> 02:16.318
so I can hurt him.’ 


02:16.318 --> 02:19.488
After thinking about all the things 
that I wanted to do to him that night


02:19.488 --> 02:22.000
—I’d been running it through my head 
over and over again—


02:23.425 --> 02:26.897
I decided to just stay friends with him. 


02:26.897 --> 02:30.900
And eventually, 
we decided to start studying together.


02:30.900 --> 02:33.970
Being the way I was, 
I thought that there’s 


02:33.970 --> 02:36.372
no way a God can forgive me. 


02:36.372 --> 02:39.775
The scripture at Isaiah 55:7 
really helped me, 


02:39.775 --> 02:41.043
where it says: 


02:41.043 --> 02:45.281
“Let the wicked man leave his way
and the evil man his thoughts; 


02:45.282 --> 02:48.885
let him return to Jehovah, 
who will have mercy on him.” 


02:48.885 --> 02:51.687
As time went by, 
I started understanding clearly 


02:51.687 --> 02:54.324
that Jehovah does forgive.


02:54.323 --> 02:58.060
By that time, I had already 
kind of made a decision


02:58.060 --> 03:00.095
that I was done
with doing time in prison. 


03:00.095 --> 03:02.632
I just decided to cut all ties with everybody 


03:02.632 --> 03:05.469
that had anything to do 
with anything illegal. 


03:05.468 --> 03:07.470
I felt like a free person. 


03:07.470 --> 03:09.305
And after progressing 


03:09.305 --> 03:12.742
and quitting the habits that I had 
of smoking and drinking a lot, 


03:12.742 --> 03:15.645
I became 
an unbaptized publisher. 


03:15.645 --> 03:17.880
But my father passed away; 


03:17.880 --> 03:20.783
I started hanging around 
with bad association again, 


03:20.783 --> 03:23.620
and eventually 
I had my privileges removed.


03:23.620 --> 03:27.023
And as that was happening, 
Satan attacked me again. 


03:27.023 --> 03:30.260
So one day,
my wife was crossing the border 


03:30.260 --> 03:32.895
to go take care of
some paperwork for the kids 


03:32.895 --> 03:35.465
and was surprised
by the border patrol 


03:35.465 --> 03:38.067
telling her that there 
were drugs in the vehicle. 


03:38.067 --> 03:40.135
We did not know 
that the previous owner 


03:40.135 --> 03:42.605
had stashed drugs in the truck. 


03:42.605 --> 03:44.873
Even though later they proved 


03:44.873 --> 03:47.576
that the drugs were not my wife’s
and she was released,  


03:47.577 --> 03:50.000
they still decided to keep my kids.


03:51.747 --> 03:55.319
What I was thinking of doing 
was going back to my old ways


03:55.318 --> 03:57.920
—organizing a plot with my old friends 


03:57.920 --> 04:00.000
to bring my kids
back to Mexico to me. 


04:01.723 --> 04:03.760
But I decided to rely 


04:03.760 --> 04:05.762
on Jehovah instead 
and on the brothers 


04:05.762 --> 04:08.699
coming to visit me 
on a regular basis 


04:08.698 --> 04:10.400
and giving me encouraging thoughts 


04:10.400 --> 04:13.035
of how Jehovah 
will take care of everything. 


04:13.035 --> 04:15.237
Eventually, our kids were returned to us, 


04:15.237 --> 04:17.274
with Jehovah’s help.


04:17.273 --> 04:21.443
After a little struggle, 
of course, I had my privileges back. 


04:21.443 --> 04:24.580
A few months later, I was baptized. 


04:24.580 --> 04:29.285
I’m a lot happier now 
than what I was back then. 


04:29.285 --> 04:32.155
One day as I was preaching
in the rehab centers, 


04:32.155 --> 04:35.858
I ran into a person 
I once knew before, growing up. 


04:35.858 --> 04:38.928
Once he found out who I was, he said: 


04:38.928 --> 04:41.630
“You’re the reason why I left town. 


04:41.630 --> 04:44.667
Every time you would see me, 
you would shoot at me.” 


04:44.667 --> 04:46.869
So after a while, 
I was able to convince him


04:46.868 --> 04:49.905
that actually my purpose there 


04:49.905 --> 04:51.907
was not to hurt him anymore 


04:51.907 --> 04:54.744
but to teach him the truth 


04:54.743 --> 04:56.778
and how to gain everlasting life.


04:56.778 --> 04:59.915
I’m no longer a violent person. 


04:59.915 --> 05:02.985
I enjoy the privileges 
that Jehovah now gives me. 


05:02.985 --> 05:05.788
I have now been serving 
as a ministerial servant 


05:05.788 --> 05:07.390
for the past two years. 


05:07.390 --> 05:09.658
I’m in charge of the accounting 


05:09.658 --> 05:11.660
for the Kingdom Hall, 


05:11.660 --> 05:14.730
instead of stealing money 
as I used to do before. 


05:14.730 --> 05:17.500
What I do for a living 
is I do gardening work. 


05:17.500 --> 05:19.735
Now I don’t carry around knives, 


05:19.735 --> 05:22.005
but I carry around my tools. 


05:22.005 --> 05:24.073
You could say that I did beat 


05:24.073 --> 05:27.410
my pistols into plowshares now


05:27.410 --> 05:30.000
—or weed whacker or lawn mower. 


05:31.013 --> 05:33.916
I’m glad that I’m 
now serving a great God 


05:33.917 --> 05:37.000
who is loving, 
caring, and forgiving.


05:42.225 --> 05:45.828
Fernando and his family
are serving  


05:45.828 --> 05:49.465
in an English congregation in Mexico. 


05:49.465 --> 05:53.002
With everything 
Brother Casillas went through, 


05:53.002 --> 05:55.037
he could see 


05:55.037 --> 05:58.174
that Jehovah is the best teacher. 


05:58.173 --> 06:01.210
If you listen to Jehovah, 


06:01.210 --> 06:04.580
you won’t have to learn 
the hard way. 


06:04.580 --> 06:06.582
Jehovah is 


06:06.582 --> 06:17.377
“the One teaching you 
to benefit yourself.”

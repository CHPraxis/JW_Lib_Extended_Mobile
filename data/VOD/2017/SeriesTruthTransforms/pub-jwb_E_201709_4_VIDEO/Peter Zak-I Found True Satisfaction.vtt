00:00.883 --> 00:03.085
On the subject of punctuality, 


00:03.085 --> 00:05.088
we wanted to share an example 


00:05.088 --> 00:08.023
of how ingrained a problem can become 


00:08.023 --> 00:10.026
if we let it fester. 


00:10.027 --> 00:12.195
Meet Brother Peter Zak. 


00:12.195 --> 00:14.363
As he relates his story, 


00:14.363 --> 00:16.866
look for ways punctuality, 


00:16.867 --> 00:19.402
or promptly addressing matters, 


00:19.402 --> 00:21.604
could have helped him to minimize 


00:21.603 --> 00:24.000
the effects of the problem.


00:26.542 --> 00:30.447
I was born in Poland, 
and when I was about five years old, 


00:30.447 --> 00:32.882
my family immigrated to Canada.


00:32.882 --> 00:36.352
I feel that from a young age 
I really loved Jehovah. 


00:36.352 --> 00:38.555
I had a good relationship with him. 


00:38.555 --> 00:42.000
I enjoyed going in field service; 
I enjoyed the congregation.


00:43.793 --> 00:48.631
But like all youths, 
I had my distractions, you could say. 


00:48.632 --> 00:51.902
And for me, in particular, 
it was video games.


00:51.902 --> 00:56.005
I remember in the beginning 
even my parents would set some rules. 


00:56.005 --> 00:58.373
But as I kept progressing 
in that game 


00:58.373 --> 01:00.543
and I started participating 
in tournaments,


01:00.543 --> 01:02.878
I started getting recognized 
and admired. 


01:02.878 --> 01:05.000
It started becoming a temptation.


01:08.183 --> 01:11.186
People would go to download 
my previously played games 


01:11.187 --> 01:13.757
to study my techniques 
and my strategies. 


01:13.757 --> 01:16.025
I was interviewed by different websites. 


01:16.025 --> 01:18.060
People wanted to be on my team. 


01:18.060 --> 01:22.898
I could see that this world 
was slowly dragging me in.


01:22.898 --> 01:27.136
For example, there was 
a huge tournament that I participated in. 


01:27.137 --> 01:30.707
I finished very well
—received many prizes. 


01:30.707 --> 01:33.409
And then after that tournament, 
there was another tournament, 


01:33.408 --> 01:36.678
even bigger, with huge prizes
—cash prizes—


01:36.678 --> 01:38.715
a competition for all the best players 
in the world. 


01:38.715 --> 01:41.717
At this time, also, 
the website was growing. 


01:41.717 --> 01:44.554
We were just sponsored to produce
our own tournament  


01:44.553 --> 01:46.588
with cash prizes for the players. 


01:46.588 --> 01:49.758
So I really thought that this would be 
an opportunity for me 


01:49.758 --> 01:52.761
to maybe have a career 
and maybe to support myself 


01:52.762 --> 01:55.064
in the future 
if I wanted to pioneer. 


01:55.063 --> 01:58.801
And I thought 
that this was a realistic goal.


01:58.802 --> 02:03.372
But as the website also kept progressing 
and as I got more involved with it, 


02:03.372 --> 02:05.775
I realized that what I was exposed to 


02:05.775 --> 02:10.280
was very, very, dangerous
—very harmful. 


02:10.280 --> 02:15.000
They were immoral, 
wicked, improper things.


02:16.452 --> 02:19.289
I was going to the meetings, 
 and I was going in service; 


02:19.288 --> 02:22.491
but at the same time, all my other time 
was spent on this video game. 


02:22.492 --> 02:25.895
But it was only slowly, 
over time, I started realizing 


02:25.895 --> 02:29.465
that it was having 
a very negative effect on my spirituality.


02:29.465 --> 02:32.302
I noticed that when I was in service, 


02:32.302 --> 02:34.604
I would think only about the video game. 


02:34.603 --> 02:38.675
When the service was over, 
I would rush home to play the video game. 


02:38.675 --> 02:40.610
Even at meetings— 
I would attend all my meetings, 


02:40.610 --> 02:42.945
but I would sit there 
and nothing was coming in. 


02:42.945 --> 02:45.782
I went there in person, 
but my mind wasn’t there. 


02:45.782 --> 02:48.000
So that also started bothering me.


02:49.918 --> 02:53.590
And at this time, 
my older brothers


02:53.590 --> 02:56.258
—who were always 
a good example to me—


02:56.258 --> 02:58.828
they quit playing games. 


02:58.828 --> 03:01.563
They were making improvement 
in the congregation; 


03:01.563 --> 03:04.133
they were having privileges, 


03:04.133 --> 03:06.435
working hard for the brothers 
and sisters in our congregation. 


03:06.435 --> 03:08.437
I could see they were so happy. 


03:08.437 --> 03:11.507
They had the real joy 
and satisfaction. 


03:11.507 --> 03:14.510
But for me, I didn’t; 


03:14.510 --> 03:17.513
I was always feeling empty inside. 


03:17.513 --> 03:19.348
I needed to change.


03:19.348 --> 03:22.751
And I remember, in particular, 
one day at the back of the Kingdom Hall, 


03:22.752 --> 03:25.322
the brother—an elder—who studied 
with me and my two brothers 


03:25.322 --> 03:27.090
approached me; 


03:27.090 --> 03:30.092
and he very reasonably talked to me 


03:30.092 --> 03:33.329
about my future.


03:33.328 --> 03:36.498
He also helped me see 
my brothers 


03:36.498 --> 03:38.568
and how they stopped, 
and they were so happy. 


03:38.568 --> 03:40.570
And I could see the difference. 


03:40.570 --> 03:43.072
I was serving 
two masters at the same time, 


03:43.072 --> 03:46.000
but I was really losing out 
with Jehovah.


03:51.213 --> 03:55.351
So I knew I had 
to make drastic changes in my life. 


03:55.352 --> 04:00.122
Up until then, I did try a few times 
to stop playing video games. 


04:00.122 --> 04:02.925
And it worked for a couple of days, 
but I got right back into it. 


04:02.925 --> 04:06.000
I lacked self-control.


04:09.765 --> 04:13.035
So I realized that for me— 
If I wanted to stop this, 


04:13.035 --> 04:16.538
I needed to make 
a complete stop of everything. 


04:16.538 --> 04:18.440
So I prayed about it. 


04:18.440 --> 04:20.343
I asked Jehovah 
for help and for strength 


04:20.343 --> 04:23.078
to give me the courage 
to take this action. 


04:23.078 --> 04:26.581
We took down the website, 
deleted the games, 


04:26.582 --> 04:29.119
stopped playing the games, 
and just made 


04:29.118 --> 04:31.553
a clean sweep—clean stop. 


04:31.553 --> 04:34.056
And I knew I needed that.


04:34.057 --> 04:37.000
Right after, 
I felt like a load was lifted.


04:41.130 --> 04:43.498
I had all this time 
now I could spend, 


04:43.498 --> 04:45.735
and I was spending it 
more in the ministry 


04:45.735 --> 04:47.503
and in the congregation. 


04:47.503 --> 04:49.838
So, soon after, 
I started auxiliary pioneering 


04:49.838 --> 04:51.573
and then regular pioneering. 


04:51.573 --> 04:53.643
I started doing a lot more 
in the congregation. 


04:53.643 --> 04:55.645
I could see how happy I was. 


04:55.645 --> 04:57.647
It was bringing me real joy


04:57.647 --> 04:59.649
—satisfaction.


04:59.648 --> 05:02.251
So I remember 
after pioneering for a few years, 


05:02.252 --> 05:04.487
I started learning a foreign language. 


05:04.487 --> 05:06.589
It was challenging, 
but it was exciting. 


05:06.588 --> 05:10.393
I moved to another city
to expand my ministry; 


05:10.393 --> 05:12.461
then I moved to another country. 


05:12.462 --> 05:14.930
And I remember just studying 
with people 


05:14.930 --> 05:18.100
as a need-greater 
and just seeing them 


05:18.100 --> 05:21.103
progress and seeing how they 
made changes in their lives 


05:21.103 --> 05:24.340
and how they started 
having a relationship with Jehovah. 


05:24.340 --> 05:27.243
And that I was being used 
to help them to get to that point  


05:27.243 --> 05:30.000
was such an amazing feeling.


05:32.982 --> 05:35.485
Now I have the privilege 
of serving at Bethel. 


05:35.485 --> 05:37.920
And I can see 
Jehovah’s hand in my life, 


05:37.920 --> 05:41.000
and also I’m able 
to give every day to him.


05:54.637 --> 05:57.640
This is the joy that I was looking for. 


05:57.640 --> 06:01.810
So I would definitely 
encourage all young ones 


06:01.810 --> 06:04.680
to really test out Jehovah. 


06:04.680 --> 06:06.615
It’s like Ecclesiastes 12:1, 


06:06.615 --> 06:08.617
my favorite scripture growing up. 


06:08.617 --> 06:11.487
Just give to Jehovah; 
test him out; give him your everything. 


06:11.487 --> 06:14.490
And you will see 
that you’ll have no regrets. 


06:14.490 --> 06:27.653
You’ll have true satisfaction 
from serving him.

00:01 Knowing that Jehovah  is personally involved
00:04 in preserving  and making known his Word,
00:07 we can be confident  that the Bible
00:09 is the only true means  of drawing close to him.
00:13 As a child,
00:15 David Sibrey, from England,  had not read the Bible.
00:18 Instead, he had been taught  traditions of men.
00:22 What helped him see the truth?
00:28 I was born in 1930.
00:31 We lived in Littlehampton,
00:33 which was a seaside town,
00:36 a very pleasant little place,  quiet place.
00:40 I would like to walk  in the countryside.
00:43 Nature intrigued me.
00:45 My interest was in what I saw  rather than what I read.
00:48 Well, in 1939,
00:50 war broke out, and our road  became the second line of defense.
00:55 And then, of course,  you get the aircraft.
00:57 Well, there was a young boy  (younger than myself),
01:01 and one Sunday morning  an air raid took place,
01:05 and the house  where he was living
01:07 was destroyed,  and he was killed.
01:09 But I remember  saying to my mother,
01:12 “Why did he have to die?”
01:14 And her answer was:
01:17 “Well, he’s in a better place.
01:19 He’s with God in heaven,”
01:21 which didn’t quite  add up to me.
01:24 I couldn’t understand  how God
01:26 could be responsible  for his death,
01:28 which meant  He was responsible for war.
01:31 So it was— The whole thing was depressing;
01:36 perhaps put it that way.
01:38 As far as religion was concerned,
01:41 I accepted it was there,
01:43 but I couldn’t understand  how it fit in with what was going on.
01:47 There was a gap somewhere,
01:49 and I couldn’t, I couldn’t, plug it.
01:51 Every time you went to church,
01:53 you had a hymnbook  and a prayer book,
01:55 but a Bible was something  you had personally.
01:58 And the only time  I ever opened it
02:00 was when I began to study  with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:05 I was 17 or 18 years of age  when I started.
02:09 A brother named Joe Gladwin  called upon me.
02:13 I knew nothing about the Bible.
02:15 The fact that he said it,  fair enough.
02:17 He said it was in the Bible, OK.
02:19 But what do other people say?
02:21 I decided to look for myself.
02:24 I realized that what Joe  was telling me was right.
02:29 He showed me  that the Bible was true.
02:31 I began to see that the Bible
02:34 told me things  that I had never known.
02:36 Over the years,  I’ve been privileged
02:38 to collect so many  different translations of the Bible.
02:41 Reading through the different translations,
02:43 it’s clear that God’s Word never changes.
02:47 I got baptized  at the age of 20 in 1950.
02:52 Over the years,  I’ve served first of all as a pioneer.
02:55 From then I came to Bethel.
02:57 Moving from Bethel  to the circuit and district work,
03:02 and then finally,  coming back to Bethel for the Writing Desk.
03:06 The assignments I’ve had
03:08 have strengthened my conviction  not only that Jehovah
03:12 is giving direction and his spirit  can enable us to do
03:16 whatever he wants us to do
03:19 but that the organization has grown and,
03:21 with the development  of the Governing Body’s direction,
03:25 is an organization  which is second to none.
03:28 And, therefore,  staying with it is the logical thing to do.
03:33 In my life,  I looked in many places
03:37 for answers  to life’s questions,
03:39 but only the Bible  has provided answers.
03:43 I am so thankful  that Jehovah continues to teach us.

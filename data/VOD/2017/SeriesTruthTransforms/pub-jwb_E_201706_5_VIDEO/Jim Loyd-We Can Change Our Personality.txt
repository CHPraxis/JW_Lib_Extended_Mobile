00:01 Perhaps for us,
00:03 our past mistakes are keeping us  from moving forward.
00:06 That was the challenge for Jim Loyd.
00:08 He was raised in the truth
00:11 but did not progress to baptism.
00:13 By his teen years,  he was getting into trouble.
00:16 As he describes it,  in his heart he had left Jehovah.
00:21 His later involvement  with gangs and violence
00:24 put him in a place  he never expected to be.
00:27 But you will be greatly encouraged
00:29 to see where he is now.
00:32 Things that have happened to you,  you can’t change
00:35 —but your personality you can.
00:39 We can change our personality  with Jehovah’s help.
00:42 By the time I was 25,
00:44 I was associating with notorious criminals.
00:47 I guess I was a criminal too
00:49 —just took a wrong turn and kept going.
00:52 I found myself a fugitive on the run.
00:58 I was sentenced to many years in prison.
01:01 At 25, I felt like it might as well  have been a life sentence.
01:05 Isolation and lockdown
01:09 was a very lonely place,
01:11 and I thought,  ‘How did I get here?’
01:16 I remember a happier time in my life.
01:19 My mom would take us to meetings.
01:22 I was in the Theocratic Ministry School.
01:26 All the friends were so loving.
01:30 My mom sent me subscriptions  to The Watchtower and Awake!
01:34 I had a box under my bunk,
01:37 and I’d toss them in there
01:40 —never opened them.
01:42 And I must have had a years’ worth.
01:44 You know, I never told her:
01:47 “Stop sending them, Mom.
01:48 I’m not reading them.”
01:52 I found out through my mom
01:54 that my dad had died.
01:59 I felt that I broke his heart.
02:04 I pulled out the box from under my bunk.
02:08 Right on top was a book,
02:10 The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.
02:14 And at that moment, I knew
02:17 Jehovah hadn’t forgotten me.
02:21 I remembered that book.
02:23 I remembered that book when I was a boy.
02:26 I placed that book out in service.
02:30 I opened it up.
02:32 And, of course, the theme scripture  for that publication
02:36 was Revelation 21:3, 4:
02:38 “The tent of God is with mankind.”
02:41 I read it that night the whole night.
02:44 I read the whole book.
02:45 Of course, that little bell went off.
02:48 I couldn’t deny that this was the truth.
02:50 So what was I going to do about it?
02:54 Shortly after that, I got transferred,
02:57 so I called my mom and told her.
02:58 It was funny; she asked,
03:00 “Do you think there are any Jehovah’s Witnesses
03:02 that go up there?”
03:03 I told her: “I don’t think so.
03:05 “It’s way up in the mountains.
03:06 I don’t think they go up there;  it’s a little fire camp.”
03:11 I wasn’t a spiritual person yet.
03:13 All the magazines and books
03:17 went back into the box  and back under my bunk.
03:23 I’d only been there five minutes,
03:25 and a guard came in and said,
03:27 “Are you a Jehovah’s Witness?”
03:30 I couldn’t believe it.
03:31 And I told him, “I studied with,  been studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
03:36 And he said:  “Oh, good. Follow me.”
03:38 And I followed him,  and he took me
03:40 and introduced me to a brother
03:43 who had been coming up  there regularly
03:46 to study the Bible  with inmates there.
03:49 And I realized
03:52 at that moment that once again
03:54 Jehovah had not forgotten me.
03:58 That brother faithfully came up there
04:02 for the next two years  every Friday night.
04:05 He thought that it’d be  a good idea to have
04:08 a Theocratic Ministry School,  so he got it approved.
04:11 He would do the number one talk,
04:13 and the other brother  that would come with him
04:15 would do the highlights, and then the three of us inmates
04:17 would do the other parts.
04:19 I was giving a talk every week.
04:22 And he started making
04:24 tape recordings of the meetings.
04:26 I’d listen to them over and over,
04:28 until the next week.
04:31 I knew that if I was going  to return to Jehovah,
04:35 I had to make some adjustments.
04:38 With Jehovah’s help —I leaned on him more,
04:40 relied on his strength more—
04:42 it was then that I really felt  that I could do this.
04:47 The beard became a goatee,  and then it just became a mustache.
04:51 No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking,
04:54 and I cleaned up my language.
04:57 Then I finally got released,
05:00 got a job as an electrician,
05:02 and was able to get my own place
05:05 and started going to meetings.
05:09 I was listening to the Watchtower,  and different ones were commenting.
05:14 ‘Oh, that’s his wife’
05:16 —one of the brothers  who came up to visit me.
05:19 I kept looking to see,  so I could finally put a face
05:23 to the voices that I’d been listening to.
05:25 I let Jehovah mold me
05:28 into something good.
05:33 There are many blessings  since dedicating my life to Jehovah.
05:37 I’ve been an elder for ten years now.
05:40 One of my sons came into the truth.
05:42 I met my wonderful wife.
05:44 She’s helped me
05:46 to grow spiritually  and to love Jehovah even more.
05:51 One thing I kept praying for and he’s blessed me with is to forgive myself
05:56 —to have a clean conscience  and freeness of speech.
06:00 And he’s done that.

00:01.350 --> 00:03.587
Do you remember the beautiful dramas 


00:03.587 --> 00:06.422
we had at the regional convention 
last year? 


00:06.422 --> 00:09.425
One of them was 
about King Hezekiah. 


00:09.425 --> 00:13.162
We saw not only 
the threat Jehovah’s people faced 


00:13.162 --> 00:16.432
but also the protection 
Jehovah provided. 


00:16.432 --> 00:18.535
In producing the drama, 


00:18.535 --> 00:23.138
the Audio/Video Services Department 
used a lot of visual effects. 


00:23.138 --> 00:28.000
Let’s go behind the scenes 
and find out what the work entailed.


00:34.617 --> 00:37.354
The goal of our visual effects team 


00:37.353 --> 00:41.056
is to take the work done 
during film production and expand it. 


00:41.057 --> 00:44.560
Our work was driven by the Bible account.


00:44.560 --> 00:46.662
The audience needed to feel 


00:46.662 --> 00:49.132
the intimidating power of the Assyrian army


00:49.132 --> 00:51.899
while not endangering our actors.


00:51.898 --> 00:54.670
And the use of visual effects 
had the added benefit 


00:54.670 --> 00:57.000
of drastically saving donated funds.


00:58.775 --> 01:03.278
But this meant creating hundreds 
 of digital arrows, war machines, 


01:03.278 --> 01:06.331
cities, tents, soldiers, 


01:06.332 --> 01:08.752
and even an Assyrian palace.


01:08.752 --> 01:11.187
In some cases, the foreground elements 


01:11.187 --> 01:13.289
had to be separated 
from the background 


01:13.288 --> 01:16.000
so digital components could be added.


01:17.127 --> 01:19.895
This was a time-consuming process, 


01:19.895 --> 01:24.200
as many foreground elements 
had to be cut out frame by frame, 


01:24.200 --> 01:28.337
24 times for each second of video.


01:28.337 --> 01:30.874
Our research team ensured 
that the world created 


01:30.873 --> 01:32.908
was as accurate as possible. 


01:32.908 --> 01:34.043
For example, 


01:34.043 --> 01:36.748
having period-correct materials 
for the temple 


01:36.748 --> 01:39.815
as well as accurate stone reliefs.


01:39.815 --> 01:41.483
After filming was complete, 


01:41.483 --> 01:44.153
the research team noted 
some scenes in the treasury 


01:44.153 --> 01:48.000
were accidentally shot 
showing priests wearing sandals. 


01:49.325 --> 01:51.260
As this was inaccurate, 


01:51.260 --> 01:54.997
the issue was corrected 
by generating additional digital treasures 


01:54.997 --> 01:57.000
and placing them in the foreground.


01:58.802 --> 02:02.905
As we didn’t have 
the luxury of 185,000 extras, 


02:02.905 --> 02:07.077
actors were dressed in ancient costumes 
 and their pictures were taken. 


02:07.077 --> 02:10.414
We then used these pictures 
to create digital extras, 


02:10.413 --> 02:12.415
using crowd-simulating software 


02:12.415 --> 02:16.000
to place them in the scenes 
and drive their movements.


02:17.953 --> 02:21.490
The angel shot proved to be 
one of the most challenging. 


02:21.490 --> 02:26.000
The original version didn’t have 
the dramatic feel needed for the scene.


02:27.263 --> 02:29.731
So the entire sequence was recreated 


02:29.732 --> 02:32.302
to more accurately convey 
the immense power 


02:32.302 --> 02:35.000
that those present must have witnessed.


02:37.973 --> 02:41.945
Finishing this project 
on schedule had many challenges. 


02:41.945 --> 02:44.347
After hearing about just a few of them, 


02:44.347 --> 02:46.182
one industry expert said 


02:46.182 --> 02:48.852
what we were attempting was impossible.


02:48.852 --> 02:51.989
But like Hezekiah 
when hearing negative reports, 


02:51.988 --> 02:54.923
we stayed positive 
and relied on Jehovah.


02:54.923 --> 02:58.260
With His help, 
the film was completed on time 


02:58.260 --> 03:10.423
and is now a wonderful tool 
to bring this Bible account to life.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Disasters can shake us to our core.

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can take away everything we have,

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some cases, even our loved ones.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faced with such tragedy,
many think these disasters are “acts of God,”

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even his punishment.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may feel that since God,
the Creator of the universe,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the power to control
the forces of nature,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
when natural disasters occur,
they must be his doing.

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were on the fifth floor

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our apartment building
when an earthquake hit.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything shook,

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:52.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in just seconds the building collapsed.

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hurricane destroyed everything.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was terrified.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I woke up, I realized I was trapped.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t move.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I lay there for two days
before rescuers found me.

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was in the hospital,
my injuries were so severe

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had to lose one of my legs.

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:24.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
I kept thinking: ‘We are good people.

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:28.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would God allow
such bad things to happen to us?’

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought,

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:34.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What could I have done

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make God so angry with me?’

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are natural disasters really “acts of God”?

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the Bible say?

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 John 4:8,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:53.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible assures us
that God’s foremost quality is love.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it says: “God is love.”

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:02.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us to be happy, to enjoy

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the beautiful things he created,
and to benefit from earth’s natural forces.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:10.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing in the Bible to suggest

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
God is presently using the forces of nature

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to punish anyone—wicked or not.

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, natural disasters

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to happen
and bring suffering and death

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
to many, including good people.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since natural disasters are not “acts of God”

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he does care about us,
why do they happen?

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:37.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned that God does not cause suffering,

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
but “time and unexpected events”

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
may overtake any of us.

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:46.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not because God is angry with us.

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:53.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, a friend of mine,
who also lost her legs in the earthquake,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
told me that Jehovah’s Witnesses
showed her from the Bible

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the earth will be a paradise.

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will have our legs again,
and we will be able to walk

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:04.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and run and dance.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gave me confidence
that God loves us very much,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s going to make everything wonderful.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read Isaiah 35:6 where Jehovah God

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
promises that “the lame
will leap like the deer,”

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:22.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I finally understood

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a God who would make that promise

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
would never hurt good people.

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:31.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had been lied to about God.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I know

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s promises are real.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible clearly teaches that God

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not responsible for natural disasters.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he promises to eliminate
all causes of pain and suffering.

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look!

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tent of God is with mankind,

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:56.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will reside with them,
and they will be his people.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And God himself will be with them.

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will wipe out every tear

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from their eyes, and death will be no more,

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:07.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither will mourning nor outcry

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor pain be anymore.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The former things,”
including natural disasters,

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:18.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “have passed away.”

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if God is love,
why does he allow suffering?

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he feel about your suffering?

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:29.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long will human suffering continue?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:00:01 Today, we will talk about those
00:00:03 who are close to all of our hearts
00:00:07 —our children.
00:00:09 I am sure that you dear parents
00:00:12 greatly love and appreciate your children.
00:00:15 What a privilege it is to have them!
00:00:19 Think about it: There are millions of angels.
00:00:23 However, angels were not given the privilege to produce children.
00:00:28 When Jesus was on earth, he was not married,
00:00:32 so he did not have the privilege of having children.
00:00:36 But you parents have that privilege.
00:00:38 What a treasure!
00:00:42 What does the Governing Body want to tell you children?
00:00:46 That we love you!
00:00:48 We are so happy to have you with us,
00:00:52 and we would like to help you to become and remain
00:00:56 worshippers of Jehovah.
00:00:58 You are like a beautiful gift,
00:01:00 a special gift, from Jehovah.
00:01:03 Christian parents value and appreciate you children
00:01:07 more than a million dollars!
00:01:09 How do we know?
00:01:11 Because Psalm 127:3 says
00:01:16 that “[children] are an inheritance from Jehovah.”
00:01:21 What does that mean?
00:01:24 An inheritance is a very valuable gift
00:01:27 that has been given to someone.
00:01:30 Often, the gift is from an older family relative.
00:01:34 Jehovah views you children as a very valuable gift
00:01:39 that he has given to your parents.
00:01:42 He expects parents to take good care of this gift.
00:01:47 He entrusts parents with the welfare and happiness of their children.
00:01:54 And when parents do their best for you,
00:01:58 it especially makes us happy when you children
00:02:02 do your best to please and serve Jehovah.
00:02:06 There are so many children earth wide
00:02:09 who are fine examples for others
00:02:11 by means of their love for Jehovah and the truth.
00:02:17 Parents, will your children become good examples
00:02:20 for other young ones in the truth?
00:02:24 One father of seven children, all of whom grew up as lovers of Jehovah,
00:02:29 would always tell new parents
00:02:31 that there are no guarantees with children.
00:02:34 They each have their own personality
00:02:37 and are exposed to various outside influences.
00:02:41 But he would always urge new parents to do the best they can
00:02:45 to teach their children and reach their hearts.
00:02:49 Your conscientious effort increases the possibility
00:02:52 of them becoming a success in Jehovah’s service.
00:02:57 So parents, how are you caring
00:03:00 for your “inheritance”?
00:03:03 What are some vital steps
00:03:05 to teach and reach the heart of your child?
00:03:09 First, please locate
00:03:12 Judges 13:8.
00:03:17 The parents of Samson likely prayed often
00:03:21 for Jehovah’s help to properly raise their son.
00:03:26 Verse 8 says:
00:03:28 “Manoah pleaded with Jehovah and said: ‘Pardon me, Jehovah.
00:03:33 “‘Please let the man of the true God whom you just sent
00:03:37 “‘come again to instruct us
00:03:40 about what we should do with the child who will be born.’”
00:03:45 If you parents do the same,
00:03:47 Jehovah will answer your prayers through the Scriptures, Bible literature,
00:03:52 or possibly by means of a congregation meeting.
00:03:56 Additionally, being consistent with family worship
00:03:59 is vital to reach the heart of one’s child.
00:04:04 It is true that it takes some planning
00:04:07 and absorbs some of your time each week.
00:04:10 But remember that in 2008,
00:04:13 the Governing Body gave us all
00:04:15 the extra time each week for family worship
00:04:19 by adjusting the weekly meeting schedule.
00:04:24 A brother from Portugal wrote:
00:04:26 “Aside from family worship,
00:04:28 “my father had a separate Bible study on a different day
00:04:31 “with each of us three children.
00:04:34 “I am sure that these studies were very important
00:04:37 for us to resist all of the pressures at school.”
00:04:42 It is no surprise that all three children
00:04:45 have been in special full-time service for a number of years now.
00:04:51 Similarly, a brother from northern Italy wrote:
00:04:54 “We studied with each one of our children personally
00:04:59 in harmony with their age and gender.”
00:05:03 Each family head must decide what is best for his family.
00:05:07 However, a well-prepared Family Worship program
00:05:11 is essential.
00:05:14 Another excellent way to teach your children is by example.
00:05:20 Children often pick up mannerisms
00:05:22 from their parents.
00:05:24 They often walk and talk
00:05:26 like one of the parents.
00:05:28 But they also pick up on godly personality traits and attitudes.
00:05:33 So be the kind of person that you want your child to be.
00:05:39 Even though Jesus was the only perfect child ever born on earth,
00:05:43 it appears that his mother, Mary, and adoptive father, Joseph,
00:05:47 were good examples for him.
00:05:51 Luke 2:41, 42
00:05:54 tells us that Jesus’ parents “were accustomed to go from year to year
00:05:58 to Jerusalem for . . . the Passover.”
00:06:03 Joseph could have viewed the trip
00:06:05 as inconvenient and even too expensive.
00:06:08 But as parents, he and Mary set a good example
00:06:12 for the young boy Jesus.
00:06:15 Most young ones can quote
1 Corinthians 15:33 by heart.
00:06:21 Maybe it is because their parents have reminded them
00:06:24 of the principle so often.
00:06:27 “Bad associations spoil useful habits.”
00:06:33 Do you remember in Luke chapter 8 that Jesus spoke
00:06:37 about the different kinds of soil
00:06:39 that “the word of God” might fall on?
00:06:43 The “soil” represents your child’s heart.
00:06:47 It is our hope and prayer that your child’s heart
00:06:50 is like “good,” or “fine,” soil.
00:06:56 In verse 15,
00:06:58 Jesus applied the illustration of the fine soil,
00:07:02 saying:
00:07:03 “These are the ones who,
00:07:06 “after hearing the word with a fine and good heart,
00:07:09 retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”
00:07:14 But what can happen if after responding to your training from God’s Word,
00:07:18 your child is somehow exposed to bad association?
00:07:23 When young ones spend considerable time with other young ones
00:07:27 who have not been trained by Bible principles,
00:07:30 it can counteract your training from God’s Word.
00:07:35 Such association is like a severe rainstorm
00:07:38 that erodes the fine soil that you have built up.
00:07:43 It can quickly wash away the good training that you have given.
00:07:48 Psalm 1:1 says that we can be happy
00:07:52 if we do not “walk” with, “stand” with,
00:07:56 or “sit” with those who do what is bad.
00:08:00 And we could add to that
00:08:02 —and do not text or email others
00:08:06 who do not think wholesome thoughts.
00:08:09 Help your children to choose good associates.
00:08:14 So many young ones around the world
00:08:17 have responded to their parents’ fine instruction
00:08:20 and express themselves from the heart.
00:08:24 Let me share a few experiences that demonstrate this.
00:08:29 One young person from the United States wrote in saying:
00:08:34 “I am 11 years old,
00:08:36 “and I am an unbaptized publisher.
00:08:39 “I can’t thank you enough for all that you do!
00:08:43 “I especially appreciate all the time and effort you put
00:08:46 “into the Caleb and Sophia videos.
00:08:50 “I love these videos.
00:08:52 “They help me to show good conduct at school.
00:08:56 “I am grateful that you encourage family worship.
00:09:00 “You see, I used to have doubts about Jehovah.
00:09:04 “If it were not for the time at family worship,
00:09:07 “I probably would have drifted more and more.
00:09:12 “I love Jehovah and want to serve him,
00:09:15 “but I still have lots to work on.
00:09:18 “I hope you will make more videos to help me and other young ones
00:09:23 to serve Jehovah with our whole heart and whole soul.”
00:09:29 We received this message:
00:09:32 “Hi, I am ten years old.
00:09:35 “I just wanted to say thank you!
00:09:38 “When I grow up, I want to work in Bethel
00:09:41 “because I love Jehovah and want to make him happy.
00:09:45 “In Paradise, I want to open a zoo without cages.
00:09:49 Sending all my love!”
00:09:52 I recall I once met an eight-year-old girl in Denver, Colorado,
00:09:57 who was baptized at eight years of age.
00:10:00 By that time, she had read the entire Bible through twice.
00:10:06 Of course, each child is unique;
00:10:09 not all children become mature at the same rate
00:10:12 or at the same point in life.
00:10:14 You may recall that we read
00:10:16 Psalm 127:3 earlier,
00:10:20 which said that “[children] are an inheritance from Jehovah.”
00:10:26 Let’s read the next verse, number 4:
00:10:29 “Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
00:10:33 so are the sons of one’s youth.”
00:10:36 Children are likened to “arrows”
00:10:39 that should be aimed at a target.
00:10:42 An archer cannot recall an arrow once it leaves his bow.
00:10:46 Parents have “arrows.”
00:10:49 They have their children to aim at the target
00:10:52 for a relatively brief time.
00:10:55 And what is the target?
00:10:57 What is the goal?
00:11:00 For your children to become wholesome, dedicated,
00:11:04 and baptized servants of Jehovah.
00:11:08 However, arrows can be made from different materials,
00:11:12 and they can vary in size.
00:11:14 Parents must remember
00:11:16 that no two children are precisely alike.
00:11:20 Some have a good measure
00:11:22 of mental and emotional maturity at a young age
00:11:26 and express a desire to get baptized.
00:11:30 Others may not be ready for baptism until they are a bit older.
00:11:36 Thus, discerning parents
00:11:38 do not pressure their children to get baptized.
00:11:41 Rather, they assist each child
00:11:44 in keeping with his or her own growth and spiritual progress.
00:11:50 But it is also true that some parents
00:11:53 underestimate their children.
00:11:55 Some hold them back from dedicating their life to Jehovah,
00:12:00 even though they have developed
00:12:02 a close relationship with Him as a youngster.
00:12:07 We received this comment from a sister in Russia:
00:12:11 “Thank you very much for taking care of younger ones.
00:12:15 “I particularly appreciate your support.
00:12:19 “Your loving words inspire me.
00:12:21 “I am 17.
00:12:23 “I am invigorated by articles and videos
00:12:26 “which are prepared by you.
00:12:29 “Your work and love bring me to tears.
00:12:33 “Thank you very much!
00:12:36 “I am touched by your affectionate care of us here in Russia.
00:12:41 “Your warm words and prayers are the best comfort for us.
00:12:46 “I am grateful to you.
00:12:48 “Thanks to your taking care of me,
00:12:51 “I was able to begin pioneering two years ago.
00:12:54 “It’s the best life ever.
00:12:57 “I am happy.
00:12:59 “I can’t be silent.
00:13:01 I’m filled with gratitude.”
00:13:04 The Watchtower  once commented:
00:13:06 “It has been said that raising children is a 20-year project,
00:13:10 but parents never really stop being parents.”
00:13:15 Among the very best things you can give to your children
00:13:19 are love, time, and Bible-based training
00:13:24 —yes, endeavoring to reach their hearts.
00:13:28 Admittedly, each child will respond differently to the training.
00:13:34 However, many who have been raised by parents that love Jehovah
00:13:38 feel like Joanna Mae, a sister in Asia.
00:13:42 She says:
00:13:43 “Looking back on the training I received from my parents,
00:13:47 “I am so thankful that they disciplined me
00:13:50 “and taught me to love Jehovah.
00:13:54 “They did not just give me life,
00:13:56 they gave me a meaningful life.”
00:14:00 And there are millions of adult Christians
00:14:03 who would express similar sentiments of appreciation.
00:14:08 Parents, take care of your inheritance, your precious children,
00:14:13 by training them and reaching their heart.

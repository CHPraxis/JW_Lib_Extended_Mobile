00:00:01 Our convention theme is so timely.
00:00:05 The world is full of conflict and anguish.
00:00:10 People long for peace, and they long for unity,
00:00:14 which is the focus of this month’s broadcast.
00:00:18 Our theme is
00:00:20 “Stand Together as One United People.”
00:00:25 Let me begin with a question:
00:00:28 Where do you keep your wallet?
00:00:30 If you’re out in public,
00:00:32 you brothers likely keep it in your pocket (maybe a front pocket)
00:00:37 so that it doesn’t get lost or stolen.
00:00:40 You sisters might carry your wallet in a purse, or handbag,
00:00:45 which you keep close by your side.
00:00:48 You guard your wallet because you know that if you get careless,
00:00:53 a thief might steal it and you might never see
00:00:57 your wallet or its contents again.
00:01:00 It is similar with the precious unity
00:01:04 we enjoy as Jehovah’s people.
00:01:07 We need to guard it and protect it,
00:01:11 or else someone might steal it.
00:01:13 Make no mistake,
00:01:15 the Devil is looking for an opportunity
00:01:18 to steal our unity from us.
00:01:22 Think about how unique our unity is.
00:01:25 Unlike other religious organizations,
00:01:28 we’re not divided into subdenominations.
00:01:31 We don’t have Northern Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:34 Orthodox Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:36 or Reformed Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:39 As the apostle Paul expressed it,
00:01:42 we are “united in the same mind
00:01:46 and in the same line of thought.”
00:01:50 We are also united internationally.
00:01:53 We don’t fight against one another in the wars that divide nations.
00:01:58 And we are united racially.
00:02:01 Many times, Witnesses have risked their lives
00:02:05 to protect their fellow Christians of another race who were being threatened
00:02:09 or persecuted because of their racial or ethnic background.
00:02:15 We are also united in our purpose.
00:02:17 For example, no matter where we live,
00:02:20 we all preach the same good news
00:02:24 and we all receive the same weekly spiritual instruction.
00:02:29 Can you find this unity out in the world?
00:02:33 Look around.
00:02:35 People are divided.
00:02:37 Nations attack each other.
00:02:39 And within nations, political parties fight one another.
00:02:44 Corporations compete with and destroy each other,
00:02:48 and citizens commit racially
00:02:51 or ethnically motivated hate crimes
00:02:53 against each other.
00:02:55 What a contrast that is
00:02:58 with Jehovah’s worshippers!
00:03:00 We stand together
00:03:03 as one united people.
00:03:07 Why, though, do we each need to guard
00:03:11 and protect our unity?
00:03:14 Can’t we safely assume that Jehovah will protect it
00:03:18 and that he will see to it that our unity is preserved?
00:03:22 Not entirely.
00:03:24 Guarding the unity of God’s people is a responsibility
00:03:28 that Jehovah has given each one of us.
00:03:31 We must do our part to ensure
00:03:34 that we stand together as one united people.
00:03:39 What will happen if we don’t?
00:03:42 Divisions will occur among us
00:03:45 —divisions that resemble what we see in the world.
00:03:49 It happened in the first-century congregation in Corinth.
00:03:54 To them, Paul wrote
00:03:56 at 1 Corinthians 1:11:
00:04:01 “There are dissensions among you.”
00:04:06 What kind of “dissensions”?
00:04:08 Some said, ‘I belong to Peter’;
00:04:11 others said, ‘I belong to Paul’;
00:04:14 and still others said, ‘I belong to Apollos.’
00:04:18 Paul felt compelled to ask
00:04:21 at 1 Corinthians 1:13:
00:04:25 “Is the Christ divided?”
00:04:29 What a reproach on Jehovah’s name and on true worship!
00:04:34 By failing to guard their unity,
00:04:36 those early disciples were making Christianity
00:04:40 look like just another religion.
00:04:42 Could something like that happen in a congregation today?
00:04:47 It could happen
00:04:49 if individuals cared more about their own personal preferences,
00:04:53 conveniences, and opinions
00:04:56 than they do about the unity of Jehovah’s people.
00:05:01 Selfishness is not “the fruitage of [Jehovah’s] spirit.”
00:05:06 Rather, it reflects “the spirit of the world.”
00:05:09 The world is aggressively promoting the view
00:05:13 that you should put yourself first,
00:05:16 but we have learned Jehovah’s view.
00:05:20 First Corinthians 10:24 tells us
00:05:23 to “keep seeking,
00:05:25 “not [our] own advantage,
00:05:27 but that of the other person.”
00:05:30 In chapter 13, verse 5,
00:05:33 Paul wrote that love “does not look for its own interests.”
00:05:37 And he states at Romans 15:3
00:05:41 that “the Christ did not please himself.”
00:05:46 Therefore, we cannot afford to care more about our privileges,
00:05:51 our pride, or our opinions
00:05:54 than we do about Christian unity.
00:05:57 If we put our own wants first,
00:06:00 then just like a man who leaves his wallet out in public
00:06:03 for a thief to steal,
00:06:05 we place the congregation’s unity
00:06:08 in plain view for Satan to snatch.
00:06:12 And there is no doubt that the Devil will seize the opportunity,
00:06:17 and the congregation will suffer.
00:06:20 We need to accept
00:06:23 our personal responsibility
00:06:25 to guard and protect our unity
00:06:28 not only as a congregation but also as field service groups,
00:06:33 families, married couples, and friends.
00:06:38 So let’s now discuss four areas
00:06:42 where we especially need
00:06:44 to guard and protect our Christian unity.
00:06:49 The first is our response to direction
00:06:52 from Jehovah’s organization.
00:06:56 When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020,
00:07:00 we all received direction,
00:07:03 including new ways to attend our meetings and carry out our ministry
00:07:07 and ways to comply with the secular authorities.
00:07:12 Did you disagree?
00:07:14 Or did you have a different idea?
00:07:17 If so, did you follow the direction anyway
00:07:21 and give it your support?
00:07:23 If you did,
00:07:25 then you contributed to our unity.
00:07:28 When we stand together
00:07:31 and unitedly follow direction
00:07:34 from Jehovah’s organization, good things happen.
00:07:39 Like what?
00:07:40 Like what happened when the first-century Christians complied
00:07:44 with the direction from the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.
00:07:49 Acts 16:4, 5 says:
00:07:55 “As they traveled on through the cities,
00:07:58 “they would deliver to them for observance the decrees
00:08:02 “that had been decided on
00:08:03 “by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.
00:08:07 “Then, indeed,
00:08:09 “the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith
00:08:14 and to increase in number day by day.”
00:08:19 Individual Christians and congregations
00:08:23 recognized and submitted to the authority
00:08:27 of the governing body at that time
00:08:29 —the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
00:08:33 Did you note the beneficial results?
00:08:36 “The congregations continued to be made firm . . .
00:08:40 and to increase.”
00:08:42 And that’s what happened when you brothers and sisters
00:08:46 followed the direction regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:08:49 We experienced significant increases
00:08:53 in meeting attendance.
00:08:55 The attendance for the 2021 Memorial
00:08:59 reached an all-time peak.
00:09:02 It is amazing
00:09:04 what Jehovah accomplishes
00:09:06 when we stand together
00:09:07 as one united people!
00:09:12 A second area in which we need to protect our unity
00:09:15 is culture.
00:09:17 Jehovah’s organization is diverse.
00:09:20 We love to be introduced
00:09:22 to different kinds of food,
00:09:24 different styles of dress, and interesting customs.
00:09:28 How wonderful!
00:09:30 But what if we started feeling that my race,
00:09:34 my tribe, my ethnicity,
00:09:38 my culture is superior?
00:09:41 Can you see how that kind of thinking would divide us?
00:09:46 To preserve our unity, we need to focus,
00:09:49 not on how we are different from one another,
00:09:52 but how we are the same.
00:09:55 We are
00:09:56 Jehovah’s Witnesses first
00:09:59 —not African, Asian,
00:10:01 North American, South American,
00:10:04 or European.
00:10:06 Our people
00:10:07 are our spiritual family
00:10:09 —our spiritual brothers and sisters.
00:10:13 Our culture is genuine Christianity.
00:10:18 When we are willing to adopt Jehovah’s thinking
00:10:21 that we learn from his Word,
00:10:24 even setting aside our own personal customs
00:10:27 or culture if necessary,
00:10:29 we stand together
00:10:32 as one united people.
00:10:35 We experience what the Bible describes
00:10:38 at Zephaniah 3:9:
00:10:43 “For then I will change the language
00:10:46 “of the peoples to a pure language,
00:10:49 “so that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah,
00:10:53 to serve him shoulder to shoulder.”
00:10:57 How wonderful!
00:11:00 A third area
00:11:01 is personality differences.
00:11:04 Growing up in this divided world,
00:11:06 we may have absorbed some of its sensitivities.
00:11:10 But Ecclesiastes 7:9 says:
00:11:15 “Do not be quick to take offense.”
00:11:19 If a fellow Christian hurts our feelings,
00:11:22 we have a special opportunity
00:11:25 and obligation
00:11:28 to show that we stand together as one united people.
00:11:33 How can we do that?
00:11:35 Colossians 3:13 says:
00:11:41 “Continue putting up with one another
00:11:44 “and forgiving one another freely
00:11:46 “even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.
00:11:50 “Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,
00:11:54 you must also do the same.”
00:11:58 Note both phrases:
00:12:00 “putting up with one another and forgiving one another.”
00:12:05 Some imperfections and slights are so small.
00:12:10 Do they really require formal forgiveness?
00:12:13 Because of our human imperfection,
00:12:16 we need to do what Paul says.
00:12:19 We have to learn to just put up with them.
00:12:22 For example, maybe a certain family
00:12:26 did not include us in a gathering at their home
00:12:29 or a brother failed to greet us
00:12:31 in the Kingdom Hall or call on us
00:12:32 to give a comment at the meeting.
00:12:35 These things may irritate us or even hurt our feelings,
00:12:41 but they are not sins  that we need to forgive.
00:12:44 They are mere slights,
00:12:46 or imperfections, that we need to learn to put up with.
00:12:51 On the other hand, if a fellow Christian
00:12:55 has actually sinned against us in some way,
00:12:58 giving us a genuine “cause for complaint,”
00:13:01 what does the scripture encourage us to do?
00:13:04 ‘Forgive one another freely.’
00:13:08 That is what Jehovah does for you and for me.
00:13:12 Putting up with and forgiving one another is vital
00:13:17 if we are to stand together as one united people.
00:13:23 Our fourth area is how we respond
00:13:26 when our brothers are in distress.
00:13:29 While coping with the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:13:32 numerous lands were hit by other disasters
00:13:36 —hurricanes, volcanoes, fires.
00:13:39 But our brothers also experience other forms of distress,
00:13:43 like the effects of old age, the loss of a loved one in death,
00:13:48 chronic health problems, and the list goes on and on.
00:13:53 What do Jehovah’s Witnesses do
00:13:56 when we see our brothers in distress?
00:13:59 We immediately
00:14:02 come to their aid.
00:14:03 We stand together.
00:14:05 In this very selfish
00:14:07 and divided world,
00:14:09 this is not a small thing.
00:14:14 It is not something to take for granted.
00:14:18 Jesus said
00:14:20 at John 13:34, 35
00:14:24 that this deep,
00:14:26 unselfish love in action
00:14:30 would identify his true disciples.
00:14:34 Therefore, brothers and sisters,
00:14:36 as we work hard to stand together
00:14:40 in the four areas that we have discussed,
00:14:43 we give powerful evidence
00:14:46 that we are true disciples of Christ Jesus.
00:14:51 Jesus knew that unity was vital.
00:14:54 On the night before he was put to death, he was concerned
00:14:59 that his disciples would remain united.
00:15:02 He prayed at John chapter 17
00:15:07 and verses 20-22:
00:15:10 “I make request, not concerning these only,
00:15:14 “but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word,
00:15:19 “so that they may all be one,
00:15:22 “just as you, Father, are in union with me
00:15:25 “and I am in union with you,
00:15:27 “that they also may be in union with us,
00:15:32 “so that the world may believe that you sent me.
00:15:36 “I have given them the glory that you have given me,
00:15:39 “in order that they may be one
00:15:43 just as we are one.”
00:15:47 Obviously, Jehovah answered that prayer.
00:15:51 He is teaching us
00:15:53 to stand together as one united people.
00:15:57 Therefore, dear brothers and sisters,
00:16:00 let us renew our determination
00:16:03 to protect our Christian unity
00:16:07 by following direction
00:16:09 from Jehovah’s organization,
00:16:11 by valuing Jehovah’s thinking
00:16:14 more than our own culture,
00:16:16 by putting up with
00:16:18 and forgiving one another freely,
00:16:21 and by helping one another
00:16:23 in times of distress.
00:16:25 By doing so,
00:16:26 we will not allow Satan
00:16:28 to steal our precious unity.
00:16:31 Instead, we will stand together
00:16:35 as one united people.

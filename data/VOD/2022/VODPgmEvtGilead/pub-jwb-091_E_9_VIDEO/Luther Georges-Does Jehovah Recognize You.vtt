00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:06.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you feel when you
have exerted yourself in some way

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and someone you deeply respect says to you,

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well done”?

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:14.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you feel assured that your efforts

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:18.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
were recognized and appreciated?

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:21.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when you dear brothers and sisters

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the 151st class of Gilead

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrive at your assignments
and you exert yourself

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish the work you’ve been given

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give of yourself
to encourage and help others,

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:36.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
suppose you don’t always receive

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:40.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
an audible “well done” from others.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will you feel?

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean that your efforts
were not appreciated and recognized?

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:49.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer those questions,
we are going to consider:

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
first, what Jesus had to say on the subject;

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
second, what we can learn
from some Bible examples;

00:00:56.206 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and third, what this means
for you personally.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the desire to receive recognition
from humans is normal,

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:09.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus helps us to have a balanced view
in Matthew chapter 6.

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:13.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Matthew chapter 6,
and note verse 3

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:3:

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But you, when making gifts of mercy,

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:23.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing.”

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what did Jesus mean?

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these “gifts of mercy”
were really donations for needy ones.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with these words,
Jesus was exhorting his disciples

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to imitate

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
the insincere religious leaders of his day

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:41.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
who publicized their gifts of mercy

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be recognized by humans.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what would be the result
of heeding Jesus words here in verse 3?

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus explains in verse 4.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:57.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “So that your gifts of mercy
may be in secret.”

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:00.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for a moment,
think of the gifts of mercy

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:03.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the kindnesses
and the theocratic assignments

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have performed in secret.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, likely you’ve
many times telephoned or visited

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
an ailing brother or sister
just to reassure them

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your love and your concern,

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:17.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve even prayed with them,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps you spent considerable time

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:24.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
being a spiritual mentor
to a Christian youth,

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:27.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you may have given generously of yourself

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage and provide practical assistance

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a distressed brother or sister

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of this you did “in secret.”

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jesus said that someone
that you deeply respect did take note.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:46.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look there at Matthew 6:4.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stated in the <i>B </i> part:

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your Father who looks on in secret.”

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jehovah,
who resides in the heavens,

00:02:56.693 --> 00:02:59.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
is invisible to mankind,

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:03.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he remains in secret
as far as humans are concerned.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
But your good deeds

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
are recognized with approval by Jehovah.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:14.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can we be sure of that?

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are many Bible examples

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
of faithful men and women, young and old,

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose good deeds and heartfelt devotion

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
were recognized with approval by Jehovah.

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:28.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example is Obadiah, the household steward

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:30.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
of wicked King Ahab.

00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Kings chapter 18 explains

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:37.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he discreetly, secretly,
and cautiously hid

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
100 of Jehovah’s prophets

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they would not be killed
by wicked Jezebel.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as illustrated here,
Obadiah supplied them with bread and water

00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:50.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
in groups of 50 in caves

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:53.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
without being observed by others.

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know that Jehovah in secret
recognized with approval

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:02.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
this faithful, generous, compassionate man?

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:07.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know because his courageous acts
are recorded in the Bible

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:09.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
for generations of people to read about.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:15.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example is the young,
nameless Israelite girl

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in 2 Kings chapter 5.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:23.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was taken away
from her God-fearing family by the Syrians.

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as can be seen in this picture,

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
although surrounded by false worshippers,

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
she courageously told Naaman’s wife

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:35.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s prophet Elisha.

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:40.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
That led to Naaman’s miraculous healing
of leprosy,

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
it led to Naaman’s becoming
a worshipper of Jehovah,

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:47.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it certainly contributed
to Jehovah’s praise.

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know the name of that little girl
—do we?—

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah does, who in secret

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:58.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
looked favorably on that young girl.

00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these two examples and many others
in the Scriptures assure you

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your good deeds are noted by Jehovah.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note, though, that Jehovah does more

00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just look on in secret.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again, please, at Matthew 6:4.

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:26.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>B</i>  part read in its entirety says:

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:29.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then your Father who looks on in secret

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
will repay you.”

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:35.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, Jehovah repays us in unexpected ways

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:38.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in ways that are better and more meaningful

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
than humans could ever give us

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way of recognition.

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does Jehovah repay us?

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
While there are many ways,

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to focus
just on three significant ones.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:57.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is mentioned at Matthew 5:7

00:05:57.807 --> 00:05:59.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 5:7.

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful,
since they will be shown mercy.”

00:06:04.247 --> 00:06:06.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by our being kind and merciful,

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:11.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah mercifully forgives us
and allows us to enjoy

00:06:11.888 --> 00:06:15.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
a warm, personal relationship with him.

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:18.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second way he repays us is mentioned

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:22.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Mark 10:29, 30.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
There Jesus promised
that we would receive “100 times more”

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
than anything we sacrifice to serve Jehovah.

00:06:29.572 --> 00:06:34.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one resulting, tangible reward
that Jehovah provides

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
is our ever-expanding,
loving spiritual family.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third way he repays us
is by means of his promise

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the priceless reward
of everlasting life in God’s new world.

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:49.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And regarding righteous ones

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:52.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
who perform good deeds
but fall asleep in death

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the end of this system,

00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus at Luke 14:14 gave the assurance

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they will be repaid in the resurrection.

00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:04.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they will see the full effect

00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:07.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s recognition and blessing

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their good deeds.

00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to your gifts of mercy

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:17.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your new assignments,

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:21.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
your heartfelt devotion will be reflected

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:25.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you, with Jehovah’s help,

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:29.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
face and successfully endure
various challenges

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
—many of which
others will know nothing about.

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:37.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even though
you may not receive recognition

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a complimentary “well done” from others

00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:43.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your good deeds, your kindnesses,

00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:46.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
your sacrifices, and your endurance,

00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
please remain confident

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will be recognized with approval

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:54.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a loving Father, Jehovah.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jesus promised:

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:59.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah] who looks on in secret

00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:01.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
will repay you.”

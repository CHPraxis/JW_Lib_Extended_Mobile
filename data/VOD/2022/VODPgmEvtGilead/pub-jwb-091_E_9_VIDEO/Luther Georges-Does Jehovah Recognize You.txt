00:00:01 How do you feel when you have exerted yourself in some way
00:00:06 and someone you deeply respect says to you,
00:00:10 “Well done”?
00:00:12 Don’t you feel assured that your efforts
00:00:14 were recognized and appreciated?
00:00:18 However, when you dear brothers and sisters
00:00:21 in the 151st class of Gilead
00:00:23 arrive at your assignments and you exert yourself
00:00:26 to accomplish the work you’ve been given
00:00:28 and give of yourself to encourage and help others,
00:00:31 suppose you don’t always receive
00:00:36 an audible “well done” from others.
00:00:40 How will you feel?
00:00:42 Does that mean that your efforts were not appreciated and recognized?
00:00:47 To answer those questions, we are going to consider:
00:00:49 first, what Jesus had to say on the subject;
00:00:52 second, what we can learn from some Bible examples;
00:00:56 and third, what this means for you personally.
00:01:00 Although the desire to receive recognition from humans is normal,
00:01:04 Jesus helps us to have a balanced view in Matthew chapter 6.
00:01:09 Please turn to Matthew chapter 6, and note verse 3
00:01:13 —Matthew 6:3:
00:01:15 “But you, when making gifts of mercy,
00:01:18 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.”
00:01:23 Now, what did Jesus mean?
00:01:25 Well, these “gifts of mercy” were really donations for needy ones.
00:01:29 But with these words, Jesus was exhorting his disciples
00:01:34 not to imitate
00:01:36 the insincere religious leaders of his day
00:01:39 who publicized their gifts of mercy
00:01:41 just to be recognized by humans.
00:01:44 Now, what would be the result of heeding Jesus words here in verse 3?
00:01:49 Well, Jesus explains in verse 4.
00:01:52 He says: “So that your gifts of mercy may be in secret.”
00:01:57 Now, for a moment, think of the gifts of mercy
00:02:00 —the kindnesses and the theocratic assignments
00:02:03 that you have performed in secret.
00:02:06 For example, likely you’ve many times telephoned or visited
00:02:09 an ailing brother or sister just to reassure them
00:02:12 of your love and your concern,
00:02:15 and you’ve even prayed with them,
00:02:17 or perhaps you spent considerable time
00:02:20 being a spiritual mentor to a Christian youth,
00:02:24 or you may have given generously of yourself
00:02:27 to encourage and provide practical assistance
00:02:30 to a distressed brother or sister
00:02:33 —all of this you did “in secret.”
00:02:36 However, Jesus said that someone that you deeply respect did take note.
00:02:41 Look there at Matthew 6:4.
00:02:46 He stated in the B  part:
00:02:49 “Your Father who looks on in secret.”
00:02:53 The point is that Jehovah, who resides in the heavens,
00:02:56 is invisible to mankind,
00:02:59 so he remains in secret as far as humans are concerned.
00:03:03 But your good deeds
00:03:06 are recognized with approval by Jehovah.
00:03:11 Now, how can we be sure of that?
00:03:14 Well, there are many Bible examples
00:03:16 of faithful men and women, young and old,
00:03:19 whose good deeds and heartfelt devotion
00:03:22 were recognized with approval by Jehovah.
00:03:25 One example is Obadiah, the household steward
00:03:28 of wicked King Ahab.
00:03:30 First Kings chapter 18 explains
00:03:33 that he discreetly, secretly, and cautiously hid
00:03:37 100 of Jehovah’s prophets
00:03:39 so they would not be killed by wicked Jezebel.
00:03:43 Now, as illustrated here, Obadiah supplied them with bread and water
00:03:48 in groups of 50 in caves
00:03:50 without being observed by others.
00:03:53 How do we know that Jehovah in secret recognized with approval
00:03:58 this faithful, generous, compassionate man?
00:04:02 Well, we know because his courageous acts are recorded in the Bible
00:04:07 for generations of people to read about.
00:04:10 Another example is the young, nameless Israelite girl
00:04:15 mentioned in 2 Kings chapter 5.
00:04:18 She was taken away from her God-fearing family by the Syrians.
00:04:23 Now, as can be seen in this picture,
00:04:26 although surrounded by false worshippers,
00:04:30 she courageously told Naaman’s wife
00:04:33 about Jehovah’s prophet Elisha.
00:04:35 That led to Naaman’s miraculous healing of leprosy,
00:04:40 it led to Naaman’s becoming a worshipper of Jehovah,
00:04:44 and it certainly contributed to Jehovah’s praise.
00:04:49 We don’t know the name of that little girl —do we?—
00:04:52 but Jehovah does, who in secret
00:04:55 looked favorably on that young girl.
00:04:58 So these two examples and many others in the Scriptures assure you
00:05:02 that your good deeds are noted by Jehovah.
00:05:09 Please note, though, that Jehovah does more
00:05:13 than just look on in secret.
00:05:16 Look again, please, at Matthew 6:4.
00:05:22 The B  part read in its entirety says:
00:05:26 “Then your Father who looks on in secret
00:05:29 will repay you.”
00:05:31 Often, Jehovah repays us in unexpected ways
00:05:35 —in ways that are better and more meaningful
00:05:38 than humans could ever give us
00:05:41 in the way of recognition.
00:05:44 But how does Jehovah repay us?
00:05:47 While there are many ways,
00:05:50 we’re going to focus just on three significant ones.
00:05:53 One way is mentioned at Matthew 5:7
00:05:57 —Matthew 5:7.
00:05:59 Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.”
00:06:04 So by our being kind and merciful,
00:06:06 Jehovah mercifully forgives us and allows us to enjoy
00:06:11 a warm, personal relationship with him.
00:06:15 A second way he repays us is mentioned
00:06:18 at Mark 10:29, 30.
00:06:22 There Jesus promised that we would receive “100 times more”
00:06:26 than anything we sacrifice to serve Jehovah.
00:06:29 And one resulting, tangible reward that Jehovah provides
00:06:34 is our ever-expanding, loving spiritual family.
00:06:38 A third way he repays us is by means of his promise
00:06:41 of the priceless reward of everlasting life in God’s new world.
00:06:46 And regarding righteous ones
00:06:49 who perform good deeds but fall asleep in death
00:06:52 before the end of this system,
00:06:54 Jesus at Luke 14:14 gave the assurance
00:06:58 that they will be repaid in the resurrection.
00:07:01 And then they will see the full effect
00:07:04 of Jehovah’s recognition and blessing
00:07:07 on their good deeds.
00:07:11 In addition to your gifts of mercy
00:07:15 in your new assignments,
00:07:17 your heartfelt devotion will be reflected
00:07:21 as you, with Jehovah’s help,
00:07:25 face and successfully endure various challenges
00:07:29 —many of which others will know nothing about.
00:07:33 But even though you may not receive recognition
00:07:37 or a complimentary “well done” from others
00:07:40 for your good deeds, your kindnesses,
00:07:43 your sacrifices, and your endurance,
00:07:46 please remain confident
00:07:48 that you will be recognized with approval
00:07:51 by a loving Father, Jehovah.
00:07:54 And as Jesus promised:
00:07:56 “[Jehovah] who looks on in secret
00:07:59 will repay you.”

WEBVTT

00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:03.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at this time, we have a regular

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:07.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
and much loved feature of the program
that we’ll enjoy

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:09.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
—<i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention to this
as it’s presented by Brother James Cauthon,

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:17.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of our Gilead School instructors.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life is often compared to music.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has high notes as well as some low notes.

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:29.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
But together they compose a melody
that is unique to ourselves.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:31.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where does that melody go?

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:36.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
For faithful worshippers,
it goes directly to Jehovah’s heart.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, he greatly values,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just the accomplishments in our lives,

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the journey itself.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So today we’re going to hear
from three students

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our 151st Gilead class.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you listen to their journey,
can you hear their song?

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:54.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s get started.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:59.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll enjoy meeting
our first guests, Joel and Adrienne Grim,

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:02.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adrienne, your theocratic goals
started at a very early age.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about that?

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:46.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my parents helped me to know
that I wanted to serve Jehovah early,

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then when I was around 11

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were five young, single pioneer sisters

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:54.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all moved into my congregation
as need-greaters.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, of course, they were my heroes.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of them knew
some American Sign Language,

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:02.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she started conducting Bible studies
and interpreting the meetings

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the deaf in the area.

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:05.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she started teaching me a little bit too.

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:06.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was trying to help out.

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:09.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that you there at 11 years of age?

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s me and my little brother.
I think about that time—yeah.

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a few years later, when I was a teenager,

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:21.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sister had to leave the area,
and so there were Bible studies there.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was trying to help out
as much as I could,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was challenging then because there
were no sign-language publications yet.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, so how did you do that
without any publications?

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried different things.

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing is that every Saturday night,
you would find me sitting

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:38.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
with <i>The Watchtower</i>  on one knee

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a sign-language dictionary
on the other knee,

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:42.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would just look up every word.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mean you looked up <i>every </i> word?

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it was the best I could do at the time,

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:52.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I got a lot of help too,
because the deaf were so kind

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:57.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so generous in helping me and so patient.

00:02:57.527 --> 00:03:00.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember this one time
having a sign-language conversation

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:03.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a young girl about my age
in the back of the Kingdom Hall,

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:06.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she signed something,
and I couldn’t understand.

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I asked her to repeat it.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
She repeated it,
but I still wasn’t getting it,

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we just went back and forth
with her trying

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
every way she could think of
to try to get me to understand

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
until I just had tears going down my face.

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:21.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we kept at it, and finally I got it,

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I remember we just hugged
because I finally understood.

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:27.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was that kind of patience and kindness

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I saw over and over again
that just really touched my heart.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, that experience
touches our heart too.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later you met Joel.

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:40.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Joel, you were serving
at Wallkill Bethel at the time,

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
and things worked out
—Adrienne, you became a Bethel bride.

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then later you both decided to join
the sign-language congregation.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Adrienne already knew
(ASL) sign language, right?

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, Joel, you had to learn it.

00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how was that for you?

00:03:57.387 --> 00:04:00.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after learning sign language,

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
for one thing, I will never look
at 1 Corinthians 9:22 the same way again.

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does 1 Corinthians 9:22
have to do with learning a language?

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s where Paul says that he became

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all things to people of all sorts.”

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s very true
when you’re learning a language.

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Language is more
than just collecting vocabulary

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can communicate with someone.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:28.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to get to know
the way that person thinks.

00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:32.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s no doubt
that language can affect the way we think,

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
but can you give us an example?

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:37.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine there are two people
having a conversation,

00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you want to get to the other side.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the way I grew up, my culture,
is that I need to approach them

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:47.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
and excuse myself, be acknowledged,
and then I can move on.

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in sign language it’s different.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
If two people are having
a signed conversation,

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
they value their eye contact
and the flow of their communication

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
much more than they value
my idea of what’s polite.

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in sign language, you just move on

00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:04.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
straight through the conversation
with minimal distraction

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no weaving and dancing and bobbing.

00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:08.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you just go straight on through.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
No weaving, no dancing,

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
no bobbing, just straight through

00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:17.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we should have applied that
to your assignments in class.

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s probably some truth to that.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was difficult to adapt.

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, you know, after some time,
I got the hang of it.

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there were other adjustments, of course,
that you have to make for culture.

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:31.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I learned a valuable lesson,

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:35.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is that language and culture
are intrinsically linked.

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:38.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t really have one without the other.

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:40.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’re learning a new language,

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:42.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have to just adapt.

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:45.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to be willing to change,

00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:50.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the best thing to do is that if there are
no Scriptural principles involved,

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:53.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
just adopt the culture and the value
of the native language users.

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:56.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what Paul meant when he said:

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Become all things to people of all sorts.”

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:03.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, no doubt Paul was
an excellent example in that regard,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it sounds like you were too.

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:09.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
So where did your journey in sign language
take you next?

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we were at Bethel,
but we really were hoping

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:14.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would get a chance to go to Gilead.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we were advised that it would be
a good idea to pioneer together first.

00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we left Bethel, and we moved to Tennessee

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joined a sign-language group down there,

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we really did love that group.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sure did.

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:29.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
We met some wonderful brothers and sisters,

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:32.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had some great experiences
there in Tennessee.

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a few years, the circuit overseer
asked us if we would be willing

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:38.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
to move to Texas to support
a sign-language congregation there,

00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:39.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so we did

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and, again, just wonderful times
and great brothers and sisters.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:45.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we were only there about a year,

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we got invited back
to Wallkill Bethel.

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:51.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we went back to Wallkill
and after a few more years there,

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers called us one day

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked us if we would be willing
to transfer to the RTO,

00:06:57.767 --> 00:06:59.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
the remote translation office,

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:00.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:01.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they translate

00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:03.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
into American Sign Language.

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were there for five years.

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a picture

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:07.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the residence buildings there.

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:09.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
It looks very beautiful.

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did you like that assignment?

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved it!

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:15.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember I told you
that when I first started in sign language,

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:17.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were no sign-language publications.

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then as they started coming out,

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:22.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had the opportunity to see the impact

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
that those publications had
on so many people’s lives.

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:27.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we already treasured those.

00:07:27.497 --> 00:07:31.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then to get a chance
to kind of get a glimpse behind the scenes

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how much love and hard work

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
goes into all of those translations
really was powerful.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved it!

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, what publication
are we looking at here?

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:45.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is when we were working
on the very first meeting workbook,

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:48.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is when we were working
on the sign-language version of that one.

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:51.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, working in the Translation Department

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:55.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
was such a beautiful way
to see Jehovah’s love for all people.

00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:00.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure that was excellent,
and you learned good lessons there.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joel, how were you affected
by supporting the sign-language field?

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in many ways, but one way is definitely

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:10.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I learned to be more empathetic.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I share
an experience that I had?

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:13.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’d be pleased to hear it.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK,

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:16.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, when we were in Tennessee,
we had the privilege

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
of studying with a deaf man named Fred.

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:23.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Fred had been to many churches,
but he was unsatisfied.

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local publishers
found him in the ministry,

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:27.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he agreed to a Bible study.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Fred loved to learn.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:32.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
He especially loved watching the ASL Bible,

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:35.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
the portions of it
that we had available at that time.

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:39.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he also loved to read
the <i>Insight</i>  volumes.

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:42.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just had an insatiable desire
for knowledge.

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:46.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would show up to the meetings,
and he would ask us questions about them.

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he might come and say,
“OK, I have two questions:

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Elijah and Elizabeth.”

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:54.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’d think, ‘Oh, he’s in the e’s now.’

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, Fred’s wife told us a little story.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said that she had found him

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:07.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the bedroom at home
sitting on the edge of the bed

00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:10.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his eyes closed just signing.

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:12.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she thought
something was wrong with him,

00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:15.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she interrupted him and said,
“What are you doing?”

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he told her that he was praying.

00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:20.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard that, it touched my heart.

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:23.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so beautiful to know

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Fred was developing strong faith

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he knew
that Jehovah knows sign language

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was watching his prayers.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was really something.

00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:36.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a picture of Fred
on the day that he got baptized.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s great. Thanks for sharing that.

00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:43.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I ask you,
Was it smooth sailing for Fred after that?

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:43.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he had many challenges,
and one of those was

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:50.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was losing his eyesight gradually.

00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was tough for him.

00:09:51.807 --> 00:09:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here was a man who loved to learn.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
He relied on the sign-language videos
for spiritual food,

00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:00.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was going blind.

00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:02.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he didn’t give up.

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:05.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his 60’s, he started to learn braille,

00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he also had to learn tactile signing.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:10.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, “tactile”—could you explain that?

00:10:10.726 --> 00:10:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on its most basic level, “tactile” is
“signing into another person’s hands

00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:21.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can feel the signs
and understand what’s being communicated.”

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that congregation there in Tennessee

00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:28.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just full of self-sacrificing brothers
and sisters who would help him.

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would go over to his house
and help him prepare for the meetings

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:34.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
by signing the information into his hands

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could know
what was going to be discussed.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:39.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at the Kingdom Hall

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the meetings, we would all pitch in
and do tactile signing for him

00:10:44.026 --> 00:10:47.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could keep up and follow along
with the meetings.

00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:49.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a picture of him there

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:51.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
listening to one of the congregation meetings
in sign language.

00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, that shows a lot of determination

00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:58.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just by Fred
but by those in the congregation,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
yourselves as well.

00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:00.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for that.

00:11:00.943 --> 00:11:03.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Fred was determined,

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would be there
following along with the meetings.

00:11:07.183 --> 00:11:09.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know, there might be a question.

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so his hand would just shoot up.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to comment,
and I would see that and think,

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:17.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Wow, you know, Fred is getting it,
and he’s still able to participate.’

00:11:17.226 --> 00:11:18.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was beautiful.

00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is inspiring.
We appreciate you sharing that.

00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:24.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now in conclusion,

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:28.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think your experiences
with the sign-language field

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:30.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
have helped you to prepare

00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:33.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
for any future assignments
that may come your way?

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like it’s helped me
to learn to be adaptable

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to remember that there’s not just
one way that things should be done,

00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:44.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also, when you’re meeting new people,

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:49.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
to really work to try to see the person
and not just what you see at first glance.

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joel?

00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:53.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think about Fred a lot.

00:11:53.996 --> 00:11:56.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would express frustration

00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
at his situation and the challenges
he was facing, but he wouldn’t dwell on it.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would very quickly redirect
his attention to Jehovah

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah was supporting him
to get through those challenges.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Getting to know him helped me
to be more empathetic.

00:12:10.913 --> 00:12:13.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I also saw his humility

00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that he would not give up
in the face of adversity.

00:12:16.786 --> 00:12:20.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those are some qualities
that I want to continue to develop

00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever our journey takes us.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are great expressions.
Thank you both.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing your story.

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:29.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the way, how do you sign

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:30.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“thank you”?

00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:34.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:40.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next guest is Brother Christopher Kitts.

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:44.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before he came to Gilead,
he had a very interesting assignment.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please welcome Chris.

00:12:56.392 --> 00:12:58.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chris,

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we talk
about your most recent assignment,

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to talk about your early years
as a zealous evangelizer.

00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:05.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:09.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in this picture, how old were you?

00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:11.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was about four years old right there.

00:13:11.106 --> 00:13:12.241 line:10% position:50% align:center
Four years old

00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.276 line:10% position:50% align:center
—and I see even back in the day

00:13:14.276 --> 00:13:16.212 line:10% position:50% align:center
that you were very fashion-conscious.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:16.912 line:10% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:17.913 line:10% position:50% align:center
Personally, I think

00:13:17.913 --> 00:13:19.582 line:10% position:50% align:center
it’s the socks with the sandals

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:21.150 line:10% position:50% align:center
that brought that whole outfit together.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we love the picture,

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we understand you have
a love for the ministry too.

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:32.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
So tell us a little bit
about those early years.

00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:36.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I always had joy in the ministry.

00:13:36.298 --> 00:13:38.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved it!

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was my happy place.

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:42.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother would pick me up
from school as a kid,

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:46.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she would take me out
with her and the other pioneers.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I got baptized,
I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:52.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then as soon as I graduated from high school,
I started regular pioneering.

00:13:53.816 --> 00:13:55.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow, that’s excellent, Chris!

00:13:55.551 --> 00:14:00.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I understand that you also have
a theocratic goal from a very young age.

00:14:00.523 --> 00:14:03.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I got baptized at 10,

00:14:03.292 --> 00:14:07.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my circuit overseer at the time
was Richard Ashe.

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:10.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he got down on his knee,
and he said to me,

00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:12.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christopher, when you grow up,

00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:15.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to be
a circuit overseer just like me.”

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his words had a big impact
on my little heart.

00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:21.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cherished them.

00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:25.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I actually set circuit work as a goal.

00:14:26.315 --> 00:14:27.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, did you meet that goal?

00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:31.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did, but we had a lot of work to do
before we got there.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2005,
I went to the Ministerial Training School,

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then after that,
I got assigned

00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:41.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
from where I grew up
in Long Island, New York,

00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the potato farms of Wisconsin

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:47.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a little town called Antigo.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spent three years there,

00:14:49.572 --> 00:14:52.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I went to Amish country.

00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:56.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spent six years
in an even smaller town called Neillsville.

00:14:56.545 --> 00:15:00.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I spent three years
in Wausau, a little city.

00:15:01.684 --> 00:15:04.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that experience was amazing

00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:06.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that’s where
Jehovah gave me my training.

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned a lot about myself.

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rubbed off a lot

00:15:11.627 --> 00:15:13.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the rough edges.

00:15:13.963 --> 00:15:16.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned about faith,
because in those assignments,

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:21.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw Jehovah always provide me
with work and places to live

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
in areas where sometimes there weren’t.

00:15:24.573 --> 00:15:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I saw some of my Bible students
progress to baptism,

00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:31.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I made friendships
that will last forever.

00:15:33.916 --> 00:15:38.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in 2018,
I was invited into the circuit work

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:40.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
down in Richmond, Virginia.

00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was amazing!

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:46.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was in the circuit work there
for about a year.

00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:49.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was about 30 years later

00:15:49.098 --> 00:15:53.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I ran into Brother Ashe
when I was visiting Bethel,

00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I got to tell him he was right.

00:15:57.072 --> 00:16:01.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got to share with him
what an impact he had on me

00:16:01.176 --> 00:16:02.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a child.

00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it really made me think of the impact

00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:08.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
that spiritually mature ones
can have on young ones,

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping them to set goals

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help them have the best life now.

00:16:13.622 --> 00:16:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s an excellent experience!

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing, Chris.

00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it must have been a great moment
for the two of you.

00:16:20.963 --> 00:16:24.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now, what surprising assignment
followed that?

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:28.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was appointed as a missionary,

00:16:28.103 --> 00:16:30.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was sent to the East Africa branch,

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:34.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was assigned to circuit work
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

00:16:35.377 --> 00:16:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So from Virginia to Tanzania
—that’s quite a jump!

00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:40.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:40.315 --> 00:16:41.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did you feel about that?

00:16:41.884 --> 00:16:43.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was excited!

00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:45.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a new adventure.

00:16:45.654 --> 00:16:50.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know the language,
so I’d have to learn Swahili.

00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d have to learn Tanzanian Sign Language,

00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:55.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I would have an interpreter
that would travel with me

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:57.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
from congregation to congregation.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was a new adventure for me
with Jehovah and with a new culture.

00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:02.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t wait!

00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:05.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
There must have been challenges,
though, and I think

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
you related one or more to me

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:11.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
that happened soon after you got there.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
So can you tell us about that
and the effect it had on you?

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:15.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:21.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, as soon as I arrived
in my assignment in Dar es Salaam,

00:17:22.324 --> 00:17:24.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
the COVID-19 pandemic started.

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:30.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so now I wasn’t going to be able
to visit the congregations in person.

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:33.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would not meet
the brothers and sisters face to face.

00:17:33.869 --> 00:17:37.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would have to serve them
over Zoom and over the phone.

00:17:38.574 --> 00:17:41.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
And about six months into my assignment,

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
I woke up one morning

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I had some pressure on my chest.

00:17:46.448 --> 00:17:49.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was feeling anxiety

00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was alone
—I was isolated.

00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:56.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
My interpreter lived six hours away.

00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:59.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
He connected over Zoom and over the phone.

00:17:59.728 --> 00:18:03.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because I showed up
to this little village

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:06.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the same time the pandemic started

00:18:06.802 --> 00:18:10.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a foreigner not knowing the language,

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
it created some real difficulties
between me and some of the villagers.

00:18:15.577 --> 00:18:18.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was feeling anxiety.

00:18:18.547 --> 00:18:20.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was feeling alone.

00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:22.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were times I was scared,

00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:27.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for one of the first times in my life,
I was feeling depressed.

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:30.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I went to Jehovah in prayer,

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:32.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I asked him:

00:18:32.728 --> 00:18:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Did I do something wrong?

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should I go home?”

00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:40.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chris, that must have been
such a difficult time.

00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah help you?

00:18:42.838 --> 00:18:44.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is amazing!

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:48.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped me right away
to see what the solution was.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was giving so much in the assignment.

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:55.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed more time alone with Jehovah.

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:59.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started waking up
at 5:30 in the morning,

00:18:59.288 --> 00:19:00.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s early for me.

00:19:00.489 --> 00:19:02.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like my sleep.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was what I needed.

00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:07.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d make my coffee, and I would go outside,

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:10.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’d watch the African sun wake up.

00:19:10.332 --> 00:19:13.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as I would watch the sunrise,

00:19:13.035 --> 00:19:15.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt peace

00:19:15.103 --> 00:19:18.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I felt like Jehovah
was right there with me.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it grounded me;

00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:23.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
it put me in the right frame of mind
to start my Bible reading.

00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:27.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so before I started,
I would say a prayer to Jehovah,

00:19:27.683 --> 00:19:32.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I asked him: “Jehovah, talk to me.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me hear your voice.”

00:19:34.723 --> 00:19:36.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I started my reading,

00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:41.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would read until I found something
that applied to me.

00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:43.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I’d stop,

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:46.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditate, think about it,

00:19:46.468 --> 00:19:48.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talk to Jehovah about it.

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really brought me peace.

00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:51.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped calm me down.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be reading,

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:58.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there were times when it was
as if the words would pop off the page.

00:19:58.313 --> 00:20:00.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, there was one morning

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:03.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was in the book
of Lamentations chapter 3,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was reading verse 22.

00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:13.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it said there:
“It is because of Jehovah’s loyal love

00:20:13.262 --> 00:20:16.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have not come to our finish.”

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I read that, I thought,

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:22.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah is protecting me in my assignment.’

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:27.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it said next:
“For his mercies never end.

00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:30.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are new each morning.”

00:20:30.045 --> 00:20:31.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was true.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was seeing Jehovah’s mercy every morning.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:38.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
His undeserved kindness
was painting me a new sunrise.

00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:44.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But verse 24 is what changed my life.

00:20:44.192 --> 00:20:46.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“Jehovah is my share.”

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:49.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was with me.

00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:53.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it says next: 
“That is why

00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:57.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will show a waiting attitude for him.”

00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:59.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was like Jehovah was saying:

00:20:59.474 --> 00:21:03.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Chris, just wait.

00:21:03.712 --> 00:21:05.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give up.’

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:11.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brought me so much peace
after I read that scripture.

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:14.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
My anxiety went away.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:17.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fears that I had were gone.

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:21.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as long as I maintained that routine,
I didn’t feel depressed.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just continued in my assignment.

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:28.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found that I had more energy
to give to the brothers and sisters.

00:21:28.737 --> 00:21:31.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to spend more time shepherding.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on Saturdays, I would spend time
with the young ones on Zoom

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listen to their stories

00:21:37.612 --> 00:21:39.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find out what they were doing

00:21:39.815 --> 00:21:41.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them get through the pandemic.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their answers built my faith.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chris, I believe you were going
to share one of those

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:51.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
(a picture of one of those)
beautiful African sunrises with us.

00:21:51.026 --> 00:21:53.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that not true?

00:21:53.028 --> 00:21:55.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that picture
doesn’t even do it justice.

00:21:55.864 --> 00:22:00.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can see why that would help you.

00:22:00.602 --> 00:22:03.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know, we don’t typically think
of the book of Lamentations

00:22:03.505 --> 00:22:05.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a book of comfort,

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:07.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that’s a great scripture to remember.

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:09.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thanks for sharing that with us.

00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:13.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Chris, as you look back on your journey,

00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:17.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
you definitely had some high notes
and some low notes.

00:22:17.519 --> 00:22:19.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what lessons have you learned?

00:22:20.188 --> 00:22:24.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned that love transcends language.

00:22:24.726 --> 00:22:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love has the ability to bypass the mind

00:22:29.064 --> 00:22:32.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
when words are formed into sentences,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can pierce right into the heart,

00:22:34.903 --> 00:22:37.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
where emotions and feelings come from.

00:22:38.673 --> 00:22:43.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed an interpreter
to translate my words,

00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:46.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
but love needs no interpretation.

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:50.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those brothers and sisters could see
how much I loved them

00:22:50.252 --> 00:22:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I struggled to learn their language.

00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:54.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I saw how much they loved me

00:22:54.856 --> 00:22:58.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they patiently worked with me
and helped me.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could see Jehovah’s love for them.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:06.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was coming off the pages of the Bible
as we read them scriptures.

00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:10.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could see
their love for Jehovah as they

00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:14.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
implicitly followed the direction
from the Governing Body.

00:23:14.242 --> 00:23:16.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
They viewed it as coming from Jehovah,

00:23:16.778 --> 00:23:20.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they followed it
even if it came to them at a cost.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I also learned

00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:27.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can see Jehovah in creation

00:23:27.622 --> 00:23:32.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you can hear his voice
in your Bible reading

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you can feel his love

00:23:34.396 --> 00:23:37.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming from the brothers and sisters
even over Zoom.

00:23:39.301 --> 00:23:43.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this assignment taught me

00:23:43.305 --> 00:23:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even if you feel lonely

00:23:46.942 --> 00:23:49.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if you’re isolated

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a pandemic

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:53.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you’re in prison bonds,

00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:55.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re never alone.

00:23:56.585 --> 00:24:01.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chris, thank you for sharing
your illuminating story with us.

00:24:01.456 --> 00:24:03.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:24:03.658 --> 00:24:06.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
So could you hear it, friends?

00:24:06.128 --> 00:24:08.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you saw,
each of our students

00:24:08.396 --> 00:24:11.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a unique journey
in their service to Jehovah.

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:13.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things didn’t always go as planned.

00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:16.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were some setbacks,
and there were some tears.

00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:20.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in each case,
they fully relied on their Father, Jehovah,

00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:24.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with his help,
they got past those low notes,

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:26.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can too,

00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:29.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah greatly values
not just our accomplishments

00:24:29.951 --> 00:24:32.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also the journey itself.

00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:37.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your faithful service
is like a pleasing melody in Jehovah’s heart.

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:40.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
He cherishes all that you do for his name.

00:24:40.428 --> 00:24:45.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remembering that should give us
comfort, hope, and joy even now.

00:24:45.367 --> 00:24:50.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
The words of Isaiah chapter 30
echo this thought.

00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:52.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me read this for us.

00:24:52.474 --> 00:24:57.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
This would be Isaiah 30:29.

00:24:57.145 --> 00:24:59.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“But your song will be

00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:03.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the one sung in the night
when you prepare for a festival,

00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your heart will rejoice
like one who walks with a flute

00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:11.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his way to the mountain of Jehovah,
to the Rock of Israel.”

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, brothers and sisters, don’t give up,

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
and don’t stop making beautiful music.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Till the next time on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:25:48.863 --> 00:25:51.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those comments were priceless.

00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:54.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Cauthon,

00:25:54.302 --> 00:25:56.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you students, soon-to-be graduates,

00:25:56.671 --> 00:25:58.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were involved with that program.

00:25:58.873 --> 00:26:00.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was delightful.

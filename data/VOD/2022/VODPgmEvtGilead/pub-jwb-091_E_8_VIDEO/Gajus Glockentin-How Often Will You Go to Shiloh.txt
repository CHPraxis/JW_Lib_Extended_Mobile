00:00:01 They were speechless when they heard
00:00:04 she would leave home and join full-time service.
00:00:08 Instead of pursuing their common goals, dreams, and hopes,
00:00:12 she would do whatever she was told to do.
00:00:15 What a sacrifice!
00:00:17 They were so proud of her.
00:00:20 And they started thinking about what to do in order to support her.
00:00:24 Whom are we talking about?
00:00:27 Let us open to Judges 11,
00:00:31 and let’s find out who they were
00:00:34 and what they did.
00:00:37 Dear soon-to-be graduates, what they did
00:00:41 is something that will help you
00:00:43 to succeed in your assignment.
00:00:46 Let’s read, please, Judges 11:40:
00:00:51 “From year to year,
00:00:53 “the young women of Israel
00:00:56 “would go to give commendation
00:00:59 “to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
00:01:02 four days in the year.”
00:01:05 The young women of Israel
00:01:08 went to the sanctuary in Shiloh in order to give
00:01:11 commendation and praise to the daughter of Jephthah.
00:01:15 Commendation strengthened this full-time servant of Jehovah.
00:01:19 Is this not what you want to do too?
00:01:22 So that’s why we have the question for you,
00:01:26 How often will you “go to Shiloh”?
00:01:30 Will you strengthen others and stabilize the organization
00:01:34 by regularly commending and praising others?
00:01:39 Let us, therefore, ask the following questions:
00:01:42 What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others?
00:01:47 How can you imitate the young women of Israel?
00:01:50 And why do you want to give commendation regularly?
00:01:55 Let’s start with the first question,
00:01:57 What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others?
00:02:01 And let us, please, look at the example that Jesus set
00:02:04 as we turn to Mark chapter 5.
00:02:07 Here he commends
00:02:09 the frightened, sick woman who touched his outer garment.
00:02:14 As we read Mark 5:34,
00:02:18 please watch out for five elements
00:02:21 of effective commendation
00:02:25 —Mark 5:34:
00:02:28 “He said to her:
00:02:32 “‘Daughter, your faith has made you well.
00:02:36 Go in peace, and be healed from your grievous sickness.’”
00:02:41 Did you note what made this commendation effective?
00:02:46 First, effective commendation is specific.
00:02:50 Jesus commended the woman for what she did.
00:02:53 Her faith moved her to act.
00:02:57 Effective commendation is sincere.
00:03:01 The woman’s faith was real
00:03:03 and outstanding.
00:03:06 Did you notice that Jesus did not use the opportunity
00:03:09 to counsel her for violating the Law?
00:03:13 This might have made his commendation sound insincere.
00:03:18 Third, effective commendation is personal.
00:03:21 Jesus used the expression “daughter.”
00:03:25 That expression emphasized his tender concern for her.
00:03:31 Fourth, effective commendation is more than words.
00:03:34 Jesus acknowledged the needs of the woman
00:03:37 and followed up with deeds.
00:03:39 He healed her.
00:03:41 And fifth,
00:03:43 effective commendation is unselfish.
00:03:47 Jesus did not commend the woman in order to make himself look good,
00:03:52 but he was concerned about her
00:03:54 and wanted to make her feel good.
00:03:57 Now, can you do the same?
00:03:59 Let’s go back to Judges 11,
00:04:02 and let’s look again at verse 40.
00:04:04 So this is Judges 11:40, and let’s answer the second question,
00:04:09 How can you imitate the young women of Israel?
00:04:12 So the verse started here in verse 40 by saying
00:04:15 “from year to year,”
00:04:17 so this means regularly,
00:04:21 repeatedly.
00:04:23 The young women would praise the same person
00:04:27 again and again.
00:04:30 In your assignment as you work with others in Bethel, in the ministry,
00:04:34 or watch them in your congregation,
00:04:36 can you repeatedly praise them?
00:04:40 For instance, could you praise them for their zeal,
00:04:44 their fine efforts,
00:04:46 or for their acts of love?
00:04:48 Could you send an upbuilding text message saying
00:04:51 “Great job,” “Well done,” “Thumbs up,” “Loved it,”
00:04:55 maybe along with a brief comment?
00:04:59 These messages do not require a lot of effort and time,
00:05:03 but they can go a long way.
00:05:06 One time is not enough.
00:05:09 Do it again and again.
00:05:10 Don’t worry that the person could get a big head.
00:05:13 In the Bible,
00:05:15 Jehovah praised and commended
00:05:18 the persons whom he loved repeatedly.
00:05:22 Commending others again and again is a good thing.
00:05:28 Now, the verse continues here, saying:
00:05:30 “The young women of Israel would go to give commendation
00:05:33 “to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
00:05:36 four days in the year.”
00:05:40 Being away from their family obligations
00:05:42 must have been a sacrifice.
00:05:45 Somebody else must have taken over their usual work.
00:05:48 They had to travel to Shiloh
00:05:51 and they may also have brought a gift.
00:05:55 Now, could this serve as a reminder
00:05:58 that giving commendation might sometimes require
00:06:02 a little bit more time and effort and can come at a personal cost?
00:06:06 Yes.
00:06:08 Calling somebody or visiting him
00:06:12 requires time and effort.
00:06:15 Spending time with your brother and sister honors them.
00:06:20 Being out with them in the ministry, working together on a project,
00:06:24 or asking them for advice
00:06:28 really makes them feel good and can be a powerful commendation.
00:06:32 It’s worth all it costs.
00:06:37 Timing is important too.
00:06:39 Proverbs 15:23 states:
00:06:42 “A word spoken
00:06:44 at the right time—how good it is!”
00:06:48 So, what is “the right time” for commendation?
00:06:51 The verses leading up to our theme scripture here
00:06:54 mentioned that Jephthah’s daughter
00:06:56 right away got much needed support.
00:07:00 So generally speaking, commendation is of greatest value
00:07:04 when it’s given as soon as the opportunity comes up,
00:07:09 even if it’s initially just a brief comment.
00:07:12 The sooner somebody receives positive feedback,
00:07:16 the quicker feelings of insecurity or doubts will vanish
00:07:20 and the sooner the other person will be happy and feel good.
00:07:24 Please do not wait too long,
00:07:28 but act right away.
00:07:31 Now, this leads us to our third and final question,
00:07:34 Why do you want to give commendation regularly?
00:07:38 As you go to your assignments,
00:07:40 you will be surrounded by many “daughters of Jephthah”
00:07:45 —faithful, full-time servants of Jehovah
00:07:48 who made sacrifices to serve.
00:07:51 This auditorium is full of them, and you are among them.
00:07:57 You will meet
00:08:00 brothers and sisters in the congregation,
00:08:03 and some of them are insecure—worried.
00:08:08 Sometimes they doubt that they are worth anything.
00:08:12 They are giving their very best to stay faithful despite challenges
00:08:16 —fighting with their own imperfection,
00:08:18 dealing with the results of their own mistakes,
00:08:20 and are sometimes discouraged
00:08:23 because of setbacks.
00:08:26 They need commendation.
00:08:30 We all need commendation
00:08:33 because commendation enhances a person’s self-esteem,
00:08:36 it builds confidence and motivates to action,
00:08:39 it reinforces our desire
00:08:42 to do good things,
00:08:44 and it encourages us to keep on doing our very best.
00:08:48 Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.
00:08:53 Now, there’s another important aspect.
00:08:58 The reality is
00:09:00 that when you work closely with brothers and sisters,
00:09:03 you see their flaws and mistakes.
00:09:07 So, what are you going to do?
00:09:09 Will you ignore that person?
00:09:12 Or will you try to imitate Jehovah,
00:09:15 who is searching for the good in us?
00:09:18 Make it a habit to search for the good,
00:09:22 and then give voice to the positive.
00:09:25 Now, what happens to us
00:09:29 if we are doing it that way?
00:09:32 It can change us.
00:09:35 It can change us from being a complainer
00:09:39 to being a commender.
00:09:42 A commender focuses on the good in others.
00:09:46 He sees others
00:09:48 with Jehovah’s eyes.
00:09:53 A commender is very happy because he sees
00:09:56 all the beauty around him.
00:10:00 So if you gain a reputation
00:10:03 for commending rather than complaining,
00:10:06 you will succeed in your assignment
00:10:09 because others will love to work with you.
00:10:12 Dear soon-to-be graduates of the 151st class of Gilead,
00:10:16 please make commending and praising others
00:10:20 part of your personality —something that comes naturally.
00:10:26 So how often will you “go to Shiloh”?
00:10:29 Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.

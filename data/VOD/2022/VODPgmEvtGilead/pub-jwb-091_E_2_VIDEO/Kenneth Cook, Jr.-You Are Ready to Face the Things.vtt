00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, class 151,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
you seem excited, and you should be.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a very special day for you
—one you’ll never forget.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as with the entire course of Gilead,
you’ll never forget.

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy to be with you today.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will all benefit
from the things that are said today

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:23.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this spiritual program.

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even so, we know that although
this will benefit everyone involved,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
the program has been designed
with you in mind.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with every talk given,

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers have prayerfully considered
what can be said to encourage.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you listen, just be certain
that the brothers have had that in mind.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all of us listening today will benefit

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the good things
that will come out in this program.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the day is over,
you’ll look back and recall a program

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
that honored Jehovah
and confirmed his love for you.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, you’re never going to forget it.

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:03.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the past five months
of your schooling, you were asked to draw out

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
principles from many different
Bible accounts.

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:09.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you worked hard to do that, didn’t you?

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
You learned new ways to do that,

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see the Scriptures

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something that Jehovah wants us
to listen to very carefully

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:22.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then apply its fine points in our lives.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those accounts focused
on genuine servants of God

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:30.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
who with his help
succeeded in doing His will.

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you were doing the same.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
You examined principles for Christian living,

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
you examined principles for teaching others,

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
you looked at principles

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to organize the work, and so forth.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
This graduation program will do the same.

00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind, I have a theme
for these brief introductory comments.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:53.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it would keep me focused.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s my theme:

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:59.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You Are Ready to Face the Things Ahead.”

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice that it’s not a question:
Are you ready?

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:07.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a statement: You are ready
to face the things ahead.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why can we say this
with such confidence?

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we see your faith.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see your deep love
for our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son.

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve trusted in Jehovah,
you have done well,

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:24.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve made it to graduation day.

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:28.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know some of you wondered
if you would make it, but you did.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you are.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:33.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re graduating
with the 151st class of Gilead.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a delight!

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:39.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
You undoubtedly agree more than ever before
with what the apostle Paul wrote

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:44.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
 at Philippians 4:13,

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:48.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he said: “For all things
I have the strength through [who?]

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:52.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one who gives me power.”

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know who that is.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has surely helped you
during these months

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a success of Gilead school.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re very proud of you for that.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be certain that Jehovah
is just delighted to see that

00:03:06.502 --> 00:03:08.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you love him

00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:12.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you went through this course,
you’ve gone through it

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that in mind, true?

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:17.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave you what you needed,

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:20.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s a blessing you must never forget.

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
By remembering it, you will put
that blessing to work for you

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:27.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever you are in your service to Jehovah

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, these things you learn
and that all of us learn now

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
will serve us well forever.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, whenever you face
a task in the future

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seems almost too large
for you to tackle or handle,

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:48.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll remember how Jehovah helped you
in this school.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your experience in going through Gilead

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
now adds to your extensive experience,

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:59.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience you already had
in serving Jehovah,

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this just enriches it that much more.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will help you as you face

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
trials and tests ahead

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:12.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that you’ll know you can make it through
what you may view as difficult times

00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah will help you to do it.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are growing ever more and more ready
to face the things ahead.

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
You already are, but you’ll grow
more and more so, like all of us will,

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you reflect on and remember
what Jehovah has done for you,

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:32.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as helping you
to complete this Bible school course.

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:38.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an example of things
you must be ready to handle or you may face.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after your graduation,
you will be off to your assignments.

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:43.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you go,

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:48.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
have in mind Jesus’ words,
where he taught his disciples to pray:

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:51.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not bring us into temptation,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
but deliver us from the wicked one.”

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now focus on the words

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“temptation” and “wicked one.”

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:01.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
They go together, don’t they?

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:02.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Temptation and wicked one.

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:07.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan, “the wicked one,”
doesn’t like your success here at Gilead.

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:10.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be certain that he hates this school

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the good that it has accomplished
through the years in honoring Jehovah

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and benefiting His people
and those in the field.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what temptations
or stumbling blocks

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
might Satan try to place before you

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
now that you’ve graduated from this school?

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:30.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are a few things,
and they are things

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of us must face.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:36.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you’re not careful, you might be tempted

00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:41.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become self-satisfied
with what you have accomplished.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t ever let that happen to you.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never be self-satisfied.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep setting goals for yourself.

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strive to please Jehovah
more and more each day

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all that you do.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the principles that we draw
from God’s Word

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:57.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help us to do that.

00:05:57.974 --> 00:06:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, here’s a caution:
Your healthy desire to keep setting goals

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
must not be allowed
to lead you into the next temptation.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:09.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is this:
the temptation to give in to pride.

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can happen.

00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:15.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can happen to a person
when he or she forgets

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:19.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has truly helped them to succeed

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and that is Jehovah.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who forget about Jehovah may become

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:26.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
ambitious and try to outshine others.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must never allow that to happen
to our heart and mind.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must never become like that.

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we must fight against pride.

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:36.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one key way to do this

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to remember that in all that you do
—in all that we do—

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is always about Jehovah.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:46.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we have that focus,

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:50.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will succeed in doing things his way,
the right way,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what we face in the future.

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we reflect on his blessings.

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:56.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see how he’s strengthened us.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:07:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re confident he will continue to do so,
and he will do that for you.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we never forget that he’s in charge.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always about Jehovah.

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we do everything out of love for him.

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:13.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that, of course,
leads into love for others,

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:16.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he loves others.

00:07:16.552 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a person fails to remember
how Jehovah has blessed him or her,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
that person might become big
in their own eyes, like King Saul did.

00:07:25.328 --> 00:07:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll recall his example.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did that eventually lead Saul?

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:32.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
It led him away from Jehovah’s favor
and blessing.

00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:37.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
People like Saul fail to maintain faith.

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:40.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
They fail to remain humble.

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about your faith and your humility?

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:46.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we see those good qualities in you,

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:51.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why we confidently state
that you’re ready to face the things ahead.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with Jehovah’s blessing,
your faith will help you to conquer

00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:59.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
any temptation that the wicked one,
“the Tempter,” may place before you,

00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:02.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your humility will help you

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:05.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain unbreakable.

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be able to defeat the Tempter.

00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:10.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with resisting temptation,

00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
your Gilead training will also help you

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue supporting our vital work
for Jehovah’s Kingdom,

00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:20.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
his people, and for those
who will yet listen.

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:22.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, for all of God’s people,

00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:25.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the greater purpose
behind any training

00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we receive from him, right?

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:30.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, wherever you serve,

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:33.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
never forget the purpose behind the blessings

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have experienced in this school.

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:39.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah and in his Son
to help you at all times.

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:43.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use your Gilead training in the branches
and territories where you are going.

00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:48.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind that with God’s help,
the One who gives you power,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are ready to face the things ahead.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:55.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we will say a little bit more
about this at the conclusion of the program.

00:08:55.117 --> 00:09:00.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to enjoy a series
of encouraging talks that for all of us

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
will strengthen our faith,
build up our trust in God,

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and highlight his wonderful purpose
that we support.

00:00:01 Well, class 151,
00:00:03 you seem excited, and you should be.
00:00:06 This is a very special day for you —one you’ll never forget.
00:00:10 Just as with the entire course of Gilead, you’ll never forget.
00:00:15 And we’re happy to be with you today.
00:00:17 And we will all benefit from the things that are said today
00:00:21 at this spiritual program.
00:00:24 But even so, we know that although this will benefit everyone involved,
00:00:30 the program has been designed with you in mind.
00:00:33 So with every talk given,
00:00:36 the brothers have prayerfully considered what can be said to encourage.
00:00:40 And as you listen, just be certain that the brothers have had that in mind.
00:00:44 But all of us listening today will benefit
00:00:46 from the good things that will come out in this program.
00:00:50 When the day is over, you’ll look back and recall a program
00:00:53 that honored Jehovah and confirmed his love for you.
00:00:56 And again, you’re never going to forget it.
00:01:00 During the past five months of your schooling, you were asked to draw out
00:01:03 principles from many different Bible accounts.
00:01:07 And you worked hard to do that, didn’t you?
00:01:09 You learned new ways to do that,
00:01:11 to see the Scriptures
00:01:14 as something that Jehovah wants us to listen to very carefully
00:01:19 and then apply its fine points in our lives.
00:01:22 So those accounts focused on genuine servants of God
00:01:27 who with his help succeeded in doing His will.
00:01:30 And you were doing the same.
00:01:32 You examined principles for Christian living,
00:01:35 you examined principles for teaching others,
00:01:37 you looked at principles
00:01:39 about how to organize the work, and so forth.
00:01:43 This graduation program will do the same.
00:01:47 With that in mind, I have a theme for these brief introductory comments.
00:01:51 I thought it would keep me focused.
00:01:53 So here’s my theme:
00:01:55 “You Are Ready to Face the Things Ahead.”
00:01:59 Now, notice that it’s not a question: Are you ready?
00:02:02 It’s a statement: You are ready to face the things ahead.
00:02:07 Now, why can we say this with such confidence?
00:02:10 Because we see your faith.
00:02:13 We see your deep love for our heavenly Father, Jehovah,
00:02:17 and his Son.
00:02:19 You’ve trusted in Jehovah, you have done well,
00:02:21 and you’ve made it to graduation day.
00:02:24 I know some of you wondered if you would make it, but you did.
00:02:28 Here you are.
00:02:29 You’re graduating with the 151st class of Gilead.
00:02:33 What a delight!
00:02:35 You undoubtedly agree more than ever before with what the apostle Paul wrote
00:02:39  at Philippians 4:13,
00:02:44 where he said: “For all things I have the strength through [who?]
00:02:48 the one who gives me power.”
00:02:52 And we know who that is.
00:02:54 Jehovah has surely helped you during these months
00:02:58 to make a success of Gilead school.
00:03:01 And we’re very proud of you for that.
00:03:02 You can be certain that Jehovah is just delighted to see that
00:03:06 because you love him
00:03:08 and you went through this course, you’ve gone through it
00:03:12 with that in mind, true?
00:03:14 Jehovah gave you what you needed,
00:03:17 and that’s a blessing you must never forget.
00:03:20 By remembering it, you will put that blessing to work for you
00:03:24 wherever you are in your service to Jehovah
00:03:27 in the weeks, months, and years ahead.
00:03:30 Really, these things you learn and that all of us learn now
00:03:33 will serve us well forever.
00:03:36 For example, whenever you face a task in the future
00:03:39 that seems almost too large for you to tackle or handle,
00:03:44 you’ll remember how Jehovah helped you in this school.
00:03:48 Your experience in going through Gilead
00:03:52 now adds to your extensive experience,
00:03:55 the experience you already had in serving Jehovah,
00:03:59 but this just enriches it that much more.
00:04:02 It will help you as you face
00:04:05 trials and tests ahead
00:04:07 in that you’ll know you can make it through what you may view as difficult times
00:04:12 because Jehovah will help you to do it.
00:04:14 You are growing ever more and more ready to face the things ahead.
00:04:19 You already are, but you’ll grow more and more so, like all of us will,
00:04:23 as you reflect on and remember what Jehovah has done for you,
00:04:27 such as helping you to complete this Bible school course.
00:04:33 Here’s an example of things you must be ready to handle or you may face.
00:04:38 Soon after your graduation, you will be off to your assignments.
00:04:41 And as you go,
00:04:43 have in mind Jesus’ words, where he taught his disciples to pray:
00:04:48 “Do not bring us into temptation,
00:04:51 but deliver us from the wicked one.”
00:04:54 Now focus on the words
00:04:56 “temptation” and “wicked one.”
00:04:59 They go together, don’t they?
00:05:01 Temptation and wicked one.
00:05:02 Satan, “the wicked one,” doesn’t like your success here at Gilead.
00:05:07 You can be certain that he hates this school
00:05:10 and all the good that it has accomplished through the years in honoring Jehovah
00:05:14 and benefiting His people and those in the field.
00:05:17 So, then, what temptations or stumbling blocks
00:05:21 might Satan try to place before you
00:05:24 now that you’ve graduated from this school?
00:05:27 Well, here are a few things, and they are things
00:05:30 that all of us must face.
00:05:32 For example,
00:05:34 if you’re not careful, you might be tempted
00:05:36 to become self-satisfied with what you have accomplished.
00:05:41 Don’t ever let that happen to you.
00:05:43 Never be self-satisfied.
00:05:45 Keep setting goals for yourself.
00:05:47 Strive to please Jehovah more and more each day
00:05:50 in all that you do.
00:05:53 It’s the principles that we draw from God’s Word
00:05:55 that help us to do that.
00:05:57 Yet, here’s a caution: Your healthy desire to keep setting goals
00:06:02 must not be allowed to lead you into the next temptation.
00:06:05 And that is this: the temptation to give in to pride.
00:06:09 That can happen.
00:06:11 It can happen to a person when he or she forgets
00:06:15 who has truly helped them to succeed
00:06:19 —and that is Jehovah.
00:06:21 Those who forget about Jehovah may become
00:06:23 ambitious and try to outshine others.
00:06:26 We must never allow that to happen to our heart and mind.
00:06:30 We must never become like that.
00:06:32 In fact, we must fight against pride.
00:06:34 And one key way to do this
00:06:36 is to remember that in all that you do —in all that we do—
00:06:40 it is always about Jehovah.
00:06:44 When we have that focus,
00:06:46 we will succeed in doing things his way, the right way,
00:06:50 no matter what we face in the future.
00:06:52 So we reflect on his blessings.
00:06:54 We see how he’s strengthened us.
00:06:56 We’re confident he will continue to do so, and he will do that for you.
00:07:01 But we never forget that he’s in charge.
00:07:04 It’s always about Jehovah.
00:07:06 And so we do everything out of love for him.
00:07:11 And that, of course, leads into love for others,
00:07:13 because he loves others.
00:07:16 If a person fails to remember how Jehovah has blessed him or her,
00:07:21 that person might become big in their own eyes, like King Saul did.
00:07:25 You’ll recall his example.
00:07:27 Where did that eventually lead Saul?
00:07:29 It led him away from Jehovah’s favor and blessing.
00:07:32 People like Saul fail to maintain faith.
00:07:37 They fail to remain humble.
00:07:40 What about your faith and your humility?
00:07:43 Well, we see those good qualities in you,
00:07:46 and that’s why we confidently state that you’re ready to face the things ahead.
00:07:51 Along with Jehovah’s blessing, your faith will help you to conquer
00:07:55 any temptation that the wicked one, “the Tempter,” may place before you,
00:07:59 and your humility will help you
00:08:02 to remain unbreakable.
00:08:05 You will be able to defeat the Tempter.
00:08:08 Along with resisting temptation,
00:08:10 your Gilead training will also help you
00:08:13 to continue supporting our vital work for Jehovah’s Kingdom,
00:08:17 his people, and for those who will yet listen.
00:08:20 In fact, for all of God’s people,
00:08:22 this is the greater purpose behind any training
00:08:25 that we receive from him, right?
00:08:28 So, then, wherever you serve,
00:08:30 never forget the purpose behind the blessings
00:08:33 that you have experienced in this school.
00:08:36 Trust in Jehovah and in his Son to help you at all times.
00:08:39 Use your Gilead training in the branches and territories where you are going.
00:08:43 Keep in mind that with God’s help, the One who gives you power,
00:08:48 you are ready to face the things ahead.
00:08:51 Well, we will say a little bit more about this at the conclusion of the program.
00:08:55 Now we’re going to enjoy a series of encouraging talks that for all of us
00:09:00 will strengthen our faith, build up our trust in God,
00:09:03 and highlight his wonderful purpose that we support.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul
was not a man given to boasting.

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:07.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on one occasion,

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:11.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
he felt compelled to boast a little.

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that account is found for us
in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me 2 Corinthians 11:23:

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:28.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are they ministers of Christ?

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:30.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I reply like a madman,

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am more outstandingly one.”

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the subject of Paul’s boast?

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being a minister of Christ.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, being a minister of Christ,
what was Paul’s focus in this boast?

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:49.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:53.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am more outstandingly one.”

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
William Tyndale,
when he translated this verse,

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
kept the very terseness
and the clarity of the Greek

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:03.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he simply said: “I am more.”

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Paul’s boast.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he focusing on, though,
as a minister of Christ in his boast?

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I have done more work.”

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now from verses 23 through 27,

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gives almost a résumé

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what happened to him because of the work

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did as a minister of Christ.

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:34.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how will your
properly focusing on your work

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a minister of Christ
help you to succeed in your assignments?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider an example.

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s found in the book of Luke chapter 8

00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 8:1-3:

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:58.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shortly afterward he [this is Christ]

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:02.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“traveled from city to city
and from village to village,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“preaching and declaring the good news
of the Kingdom of God.

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:09.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the Twelve were with him,
as were certain women

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who had been cured
of wicked spirits and sicknesses:

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mary who was called Magdalene,

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from whom seven demons had come out;

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:23.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Joanna the wife of Chuza,
Herod’s man in charge;

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Susanna; and many other women,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were ministering to them
from their belongings.”

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:38.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
A group: Christ, the Twelve,

00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:40.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
and women

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:44.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
(women who ministered to the others)

00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:45.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what did that mean?

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:50.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did it mean they cooked the meals,
washed the dishes, mended the clothes?

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Possibly but not necessarily entirely that.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women ministered to the others

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping them to complete their assignment

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:06.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they went on completing
their assignment as disciples of Christ.

00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the backgrounds of these women.

00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:12.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke mentions three.

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:17.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says they’re women who were cured
of wicked spirits and sicknesses.

00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:18.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Mary.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:21.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mary,” he says,
“from whom seven demons had come out.”

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:28.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also mentions “Joanna,
the wife of Chuza, Herod’s man in charge,”

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Susanna.”

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:31.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of their backgrounds.

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary—seven demons came out of her.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how that demon possession
contributed to her personality.

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Joanna?

00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Joanna,” it says “the wife of Chuza,
Herod’s man in charge.”

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:49.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
Joanna lived in Herod’s palace;

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:51.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was a woman of the court.

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:55.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also Susanna

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:58.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it doesn’t say specifically much about her

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:02.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
other than perhaps she was
one of the women who was cured of a sickness.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was her personality like?

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:08.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did these personalities work together?

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:15.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s part of the example of what
can help us to minister,

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:19.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is to realize that when
we look through the Gospel accounts,

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:23.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
we never find these women
bickering or arguing among themselves

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
about position or prominence or place,

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
unlike some others in the group
that were with them.

00:04:32.288 --> 00:04:33.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because these women
focused on their ministry;

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
they focused on their work.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
They served others,
and they served each other.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is a powerful example
for you and for me.

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:54.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember at Isaiah 11:6, it’s prophesied:

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wolf will reside . . . with the lamb.”

00:04:56.746 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lions with calves
—it’s not going to be all lambs.

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will meet diverse personalities
in your assignments,

00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:11.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have to work
with diverse personalities

00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like the women did.

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will you do?

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that some of the very qualities
that make a lion or make a wolf

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be exactly the qualities
you need

00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help you fulfill your assignment.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:32.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’re not all lambs,
but they are all our brothers and sisters.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah allows
a diversity of personalities

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the context of the new personality,
then so should we.

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:45.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Diverse personalities
make for rich friendships.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Luke wrote these words,

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s talking about events

00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
that took place
around the Passover of 31 C.E.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think of these women,

00:05:55.671 --> 00:06:00.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
these women were with Jesus

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:02.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Golgotha.

00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women were at the tomb.

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely these women may have been
in the upper room as well.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
That tells us that these women endured

00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:14.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
challenging circumstances.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stuck with the Lord.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:18.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped them?

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:20.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look back at the verse.

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 2 says:

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:27.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As were certain women who had been cured
of wicked spirits and sicknesses.”

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women deeply appreciated
what Jesus had done for them.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly they glorified God
because of what Jesus had done for them.

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they also

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowed their appreciation
to help them endure

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to endure in a self-sacrificing life
of ministering to others.

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:54.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stay appreciative,
and that will help you endure.

00:06:56.365 --> 00:07:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our friends are dying;
our friends are getting sick.

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:07.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on how Jehovah has blessed you.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on the little things each day,

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
the little gifts Jehovah gives you

00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
—maybe it’s simply the peace
in your heart and mind this day.

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:21.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remain appreciative for that,

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will help you endure
as a minister in your assignment.

00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
One other thing that’s noteworthy
about these women

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:34.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that these women were not easily
thrown off by others.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember we said—
We talked about others, the other disciples.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
When other disciples left Christ,
the women stayed.

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Golgotha, even the apostles

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a certain degree had left Christ or fled.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
The women stayed.

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:55.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stood solidly on their own faith.

00:07:55.825 --> 00:08:00.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
do not be thrown off easily by others.

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes—and you can imagine
for these women with the disciples—

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
it felt like a family.

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:09.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes today in families
ones choose to leave Jehovah

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:11.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
even at this late hour.

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:15.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stand solidly on your own faith.

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the women,
do not be easily thrown off.

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay with Jehovah.

00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:24.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women must have made
quite an impression on Luke,

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he’s the only Gospel writer
who mentions them by name in this way.

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:33.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly, Luke was
a traveling companion of Paul’s.

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
From about 50 C.E. in Troas,

00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:37.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
he picked up with Paul
and started traveling with him,

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:40.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he traveled with him for years.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they spoke together.

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they spoke about these women.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:48.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they talked
about how important it is

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:51.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on the work of ministering

00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:54.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not to get distracted by other things.

00:08:54.884 --> 00:08:59.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or I wonder if they talked
about the value of preserving unity

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:02.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
by learning to work
with different personalities.

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:07.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they talk about the power
of appreciation to endure?

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:10.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know.

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:14.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what we do know is this:
When Paul was in prison in Rome,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he wrote his letter to the Hebrews,

00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation in Judea in Jerusalem,
Luke was with him.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you remember what Paul wrote
at Hebrews 6:10?

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work and the love

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
you showed for his name by ministering.”

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not forget these women.

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah will not forget you.

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:42.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you work hard

00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:46.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put into practice the things
that you have learned.

00:09:46.202 --> 00:09:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may you be able to say

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are more outstandingly
a minister of Christ.

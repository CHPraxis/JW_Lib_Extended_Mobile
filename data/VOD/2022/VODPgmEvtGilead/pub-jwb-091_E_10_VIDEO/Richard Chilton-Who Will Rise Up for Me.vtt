00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to start
by telling you an experience

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:08.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a brother at Patterson Bethel.

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had recently lost a loved one

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:13.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a parent, in fact—

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:15.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a horrible accident.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he desperately needed
to talk with someone

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what he was going through
and how he was feeling.

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was, in a word, unraveling,
and he needed help.

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he called a close friend of his
at Wallkill Bethel

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, unfortunately,
the brother said that at that time

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was unable to talk.

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:45.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever found yourself
in a similar situation

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is, feeling like you’re drowning

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in need of assistance?

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist did.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me his words
in the 94th Psalm

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note his question.

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:06.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Psalm 94:16.

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist asked in part:

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will rise up for me?”

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:18.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will rise up for me?”

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
He goes on to answer his own question

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 17 and 19.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “If Jehovah had not been my helper,

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:32.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I would soon have perished. . . .

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:39.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
you [Jehovah, you]
comforted and soothed me.”

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you and I send up
such heartfelt prayers to Jehovah,

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does he rise up for us?

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can we imitate him

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
by rising up in behalf of others?

00:01:56.232 --> 00:02:00.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back in time
and consider an example.

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:03.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the days of Israel’s judges,

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:08.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
there lived a wealthy landowner named Boaz.

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:11.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
In obedience to Jehovah’s Law,

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:14.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
he made sure that in his fields

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
gleanings were left
for the afflicted and poor.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:24.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
he observes a woman working in his fields

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he does not recognize.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
And soon he learns
that she is the foreigner Ruth,

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
who up to this point,
he has only heard about.

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does Boaz do?

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how he rose up for her

00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:45.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ruth 2:8

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:47.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ruth chapter 2,

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting with verse 8:

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boaz said to Ruth: ‘Listen, my daughter.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not go away to glean in another field,

00:02:57.827 --> 00:02:59.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and do not go anywhere else;

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘stay close by my young women.

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:07.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Keep your eyes
on the field that they harvest,

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:09.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and go with them.

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have commanded the young men
not to touch you.

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘When you are thirsty,

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:19.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to the water jars and drink
from what the young men have drawn.’”

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Boaz protected Ruth.

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:27.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brought her under his loving care.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see him looking out for, shielding,

00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
defending the one in need.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Ruth, according to verse 10,

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
questions his motive
for helping her, a foreigner,

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice a second way he rose up in her behalf

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ruth 2:11:

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boaz answered her:

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:55.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘A full report was made to me

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘of all you have done for your mother-in-law

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘after the death of your husband

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:06.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and how you left
your father and your mother

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the land of your relatives

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to go to a people
whom you had not known before.

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:17.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘May Jehovah reward you
for what you have done,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and may there be a perfect wage for you

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘from Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“under whose wings
you have come to seek refuge.’

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:30.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this she said:

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord,

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because you have comforted me

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and spoken reassuringly

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to your servant,

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
although I’m not even one of your servants.’”

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:52.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Boaz spoke reassuringly to Ruth,

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:57.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
the footnote says
that he ‘spoke to her heart.’

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:03.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words were not
just general expressions of praise.

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:05.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were specific to Ruth

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to her personal circumstances.

00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:12.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reassured Ruth that Jehovah loved her

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the sacrifices she had made

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that she would not be forgotten.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:22.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those comforting, encouraging words of Boaz

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
convinced Ruth

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:28.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everything was going to be OK.

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:32.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Boaz did more
than offer reassuring words.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the third way he rose up

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ruth 4:9.

00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
By taking swift action,

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boaz ensured that the inheritance

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his deceased relative Elimelech

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:51.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
would remain in their family

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 4, verse 9:

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:57.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boaz said to the elders and all the people:

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You are witnesses today

00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:03.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that I am buying from Naomi

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘all that belonged to Elimelech

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:13.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and all that belonged
to Chilion and Mahlon.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabitess,

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the wife of Mahlon, as a wife
[for what reason?]

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to restore the name
of the dead man

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to his inheritance,

00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that the name of the dead man

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘will not be cut off from among his brothers

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:34.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and from the city gate of his home.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are witnesses today.’”

00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used Boaz

00:06:41.884 --> 00:06:45.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rise up for Ruth and Naomi

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
in three main ways.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
One,

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:52.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
he protected those under his care.

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:54.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second,

00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
he spoke reassuringly to them.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third,

00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took action.

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing the need, he rose up to meet it

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he protected,

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:11.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
he reassured,

00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:13.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took action.

00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:19.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how about you and me?

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we not do the same

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:24.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those in need of assistance?

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can result when we do?

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:31.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, before you answer that,

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s go back to our opening experience.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the very next morning

00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:43.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
upon arriving at his work assignment,

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
our distressed brother received a phone call

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Patterson lobby.

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:54.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the brother, the friend from Wallkill.

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:57.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had gotten up early that morning

00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:01.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had driven over an hour
from the Wallkill complex

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach the Patterson complex by 8:00 a.m.

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:08.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had arranged
for a private conference room,

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:13.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was there
waiting for that distressed friend

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:18.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could find out, “How can I help?”

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was 22 years ago.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I can tell you now,

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:25.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have never forgotten

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
what that friend did for me

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he rose up for me on that day.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of the action that he took,

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:37.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt reassured,

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt protected, and I felt loved.

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:44.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you 24 students—

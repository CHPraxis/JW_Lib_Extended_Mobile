00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible prophecy is a fascinating subject.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prophecy is far more than
just predictions about the future.

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows all the facts.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
He can even control and change factors

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.586 line:10% position:50% align:center
to ensure the outcome he desires.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 55:11, he says:

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My word that goes out of my mouth . . .

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will not return to me without results, . . .

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will have sure success.”

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s prophecies

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.811 line:10% position:50% align:center
have a perfect record of success.

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:43.606 line:10% position:50% align:center
He has led his people in the past.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.816 line:10% position:50% align:center
So when he prophesies

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’ll lead his people
to real, lasting peace in the future,

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.994 line:10% position:50% align:center
The prophecies given to Daniel

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.788 line:10% position:50% align:center
clearly show that God’s Kingdom

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
will without a doubt
bring lasting peace for all mankind.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.066 line:10% position:50% align:center
I have found a man from the exiles of Judah

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
who can make known the interpretation to the king.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know who he is.

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you really make known to me

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dream that I saw

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its interpretation?

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is your dream.

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Great Timekeeper.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophetic portions of the book of Daniel

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
build faith by showing that Jehovah knows

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
the course of history centuries

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even millenniums—in advance.

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
While portions of these prophecies

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
were fulfilled in Daniel’s time,

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of the details are being fulfilled

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
right down to our day.

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:17.783 line:10% position:50% align:center
So as we discover

00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:19.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
the significance of these prophecies,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’re excited about what lies ahead.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
And our confidence grows as we discern

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has been leading
his people all along.

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the days of those kings,

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will never be destroyed.

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
The divine dream

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Daniel interprets
for King Nebuchadnezzar

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.937 line:10% position:50% align:center
constitutes a prophecy

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:50.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
crucial for the lasting peace of mankind

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:55.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a promise from Jehovah
to set up a Kingdom

00:02:55.946 --> 00:03:00.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be vastly superior
to earthly kingdoms.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
History has shown us

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
how every type
of human government imaginable has failed.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would Jehovah’s government come?

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:14.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
When would it arrive?

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:19.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were questions
Daniel himself likely had.

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:27.895 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is “a Revealer of secrets.”

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.980 line:10% position:50% align:center
He would eventually answer

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.524 line:10% position:50% align:center
these questions in due time.

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:35.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a diligent student of the Scriptures,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Daniel

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
had full faith and confidence

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:40.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s ability

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:43.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
to schedule events and bring them about.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now likely in his 90’s,

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was particularly interested

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
in prophecies regarding the restoration

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:53.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his beloved city, Jerusalem.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:00.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:03.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will turn my attention to you,

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:08.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will make good my promise

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:12.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
by bringing you back to this place.”

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah’s prophecy

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:18.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
had given Daniel hope

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.947 line:10% position:50% align:center
because it indicated that the Jews

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:22.199 line:10% position:50% align:center
would soon return to their homeland of Judah

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
and rebuild Jerusalem along with its temple.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes sense
that Daniel would be interested

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the restoration of the temple
because from the time of King Solomon,

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:36.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
the temple in Jerusalem
was the world center for worship of Jehovah.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was very important to the Jews.

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:41.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Scriptures,

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
the temple was often called
“the house of Jehovah.”

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:50.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, after Jehovah allowed young Daniel
and the rest of the Israelites

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:52.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be taken captive to Babylon,

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:56.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
the city of Jerusalem
and the temple were destroyed.

00:04:56.942 --> 00:05:00.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
So naturally, a God-fearing man like Daniel

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:03.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be interested
in seeing the temple rebuilt.

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:07.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, as a man of faith,

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:10.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel supplicates Jehovah.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah,

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
do hear,

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:21.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
do forgive.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah, do pay attention and act.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not delay,

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your own sake,

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:31.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
O my God.

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:38.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Daniel,

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:40.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
now I have come to give you

00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:43.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
insight and understanding.

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:48.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
The visit of this angel

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:52.289 line:10% position:50% align:center
gave Daniel some answers and a hope.

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s messenger provided

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
so many details of promises to come.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured Daniel

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:02.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Jews would be restored
to their homeland.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:06.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their exile in Babylonia was almost over.

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:10.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that wasn’t the end
of the angel’s message.

00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:12.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave Daniel insight

00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:16.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
into something of far greater significance.

00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:19.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was told when God’s people
could expect the arrival

00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:20.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the foretold Messiah.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Messiah would be the ruler
who would make it possible

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
for obedient humans
to regain the blessing of perfect life

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:31.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
—free from sickness, free from death.

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:33.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Messiah would pave the way

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:35.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
for lasting peace for mankind.

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:39.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a strengthening message

00:06:39.378 --> 00:06:42.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Daniel to receive!

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:44.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he likely had some questions.

00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:48.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
The angel told Daniel
that Jerusalem and its temple

00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:51.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.

00:06:51.765 --> 00:06:53.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, at the time,

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:57.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem and the temple were in shambles.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they rebuild it?

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who would be responsible for this?

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:04.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
Babylon had been overtaken by Medo-Persia,

00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:07.114 line:10% position:50% align:center
pictured by the silver chest and arms

00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:09.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:13.495 line:10% position:50% align:center
Not long after

00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:15.455 line:10% position:50% align:center
this change in world rulership,

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:16.748 line:10% position:50% align:center
Persian King Cyrus

00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:18.667 line:10% position:50% align:center
issued a royal decree.

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.920 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was a commission from Cyrus himself

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.922 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the Jews to return to Jerusalem

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:25.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
and rebuild the temple.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Cyrus’ release of the Jews
was in notable contrast

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:37.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Babylonians’ desire
to keep them captive.

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:39.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cyrus even authorized funds

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:42.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the king’s house
to cover construction expenses.

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would this pagan ruler

00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:48.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
have any interest in, first of all,

00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:51.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting the captive Jews free and, second,

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:56.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
financing the rebuilding
of their temple in Jerusalem?

00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra’s words at 2 Chronicles 36:22 tell us:

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah stirred the spirit
of King Cyrus of Persia.”

00:08:06.923 --> 00:08:11.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can maneuver events
to make sure his word is fulfilled.

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:15.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can use anyone to accomplish his purpose,

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:20.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this would include
even a foreign king, like Cyrus.

00:08:20.604 --> 00:08:25.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with this decree,
the Jews returned to Judah.

00:08:30.322 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Launching a construction project

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resettling an entire city

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a major undertaking.

00:08:37.454 --> 00:08:40.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
High Priest Jeshua and Governor Zerubbabel

00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:42.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
were appointed to take the lead

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:44.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
in setting up the altar

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:46.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rebuilding the temple.

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:49.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this wasn’t without its challenges.

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:53.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enemies of Judah sought
to sabotage the building of the temple,

00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:56.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
attempting to disrupt the peace.

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:58.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initial attempts

00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:00.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
to halt the building progress failed;

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:02.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
however, eventually these enemies succeeded

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:04.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
in having an official ban

00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:06.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
placed on the temple-building work.

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:09.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the problem here?

00:09:09.152 --> 00:09:11.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears the Jews let fear of man

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
stop the building work

00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:16.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
after about 14 years of constant opposition.

00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:21.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there is a bigger picture at play here.

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:24.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Daniel’s prophecy foretold

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:26.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jerusalem and its temple

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:29.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, with the work halted,

00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:34.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
the temple remained unfinished.

00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:37.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would that mean
for the coming of the Messiah?

00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:40.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeshua and Zerubbabel needed guidance.

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:45.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is where Jehovah
steps in to provide encouragement

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:47.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
—first through the prophet Haggai.

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haggai’s clear and powerful message

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:54.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
gets right to the heart of the matter.

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:57.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
He conveys Jehovah’s direction to get up

00:09:57.159 --> 00:09:59.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep building the temple despite opposition.

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:03.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews had a decision to make here.

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:07.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would they allow opposition
to hinder the work?

00:10:07.294 --> 00:10:09.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or would they listen to Jehovah’s words

00:10:09.754 --> 00:10:12.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Haggai
and keep rebuilding the temple?

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:17.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
To guide them further,
Jehovah spoke to the prophet Zechariah

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:18.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave him visions

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide the Jews with a message.

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:22.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zechariah made it clear to the Jews

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:25.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would not allow
their opposers to harm them

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:28.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
or thwart the temple-rebuilding work.

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:32.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was only with Jehovah’s guidance
that the Jews would succeed.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Energized by Jehovah’s motivating words
through these two prophets,

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:38.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
they courageously resumed construction

00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:41.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the temple, and it was inaugurated

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 515 B.C.E.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it seems that at some point

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:47.667 line:10% position:50% align:center
over the following decades,

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:50.420 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Jews lost their initial zeal.

00:10:52.088 --> 00:10:55.008 line:10% position:50% align:center
The temple was rebuilt and inaugurated,

00:10:55.008 --> 00:10:57.719 line:10% position:50% align:center
but Jerusalem’s walls and gates remained unfinished,

00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:00.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
with huge gaps left in them.

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:04.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was significant because the city
was surrounded by enemy nations.

00:11:04.726 --> 00:11:07.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the protection of these walls,

00:11:07.229 --> 00:11:10.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem seemed vulnerable.

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:12.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Nehemiah learned of this,

00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:15.320 line:10% position:50% align:center
he was visibly distressed.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.322 line:10% position:50% align:center
What’s going on, Hanani?

00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:19.908 line:10% position:50% align:center
How are our people?

00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:22.244 line:10% position:50% align:center
Not good.

00:11:22.869 --> 00:11:26.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:29.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:32.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:11:34.047 --> 00:11:35.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the temple?

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stands,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the services

00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:39.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
are nothing but empty rituals.

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:42.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the people and the priests

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
ignore God’s Law.

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:46.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah must have been shocked

00:11:46.893 --> 00:11:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear about the condition of Jerusalem.

00:11:49.145 --> 00:11:51.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this time, he was serving as cupbearer

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Persian King in Shushan.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.111 line:10% position:50% align:center
The journey from Shushan to Jerusalem

00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
was about 1,000 miles (1,600 km).

00:11:58.154 --> 00:12:00.115 line:10% position:50% align:center
Still,

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:02.534 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah felt compelled to act.

00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:12.252 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah rejoiced at the prospect

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:14.254 line:10% position:50% align:center
of rebuilding the walls.

00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:19.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews at this time

00:12:19.217 --> 00:12:21.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
were still fearful of their opposers,

00:12:21.303 --> 00:12:24.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Nehemiah was intent on changing that.

00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:29.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that Jehovah was behind the work.

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:32.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if Jehovah is behind something,

00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:36.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no amount of opposition
that can thwart his will,

00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:40.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the wall repairs began.

00:12:43.408 --> 00:12:44.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t to say

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there were not challenges along the way.

00:12:47.704 --> 00:12:50.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Opposers did not give up.

00:12:52.626 --> 00:12:55.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recommend we turn the accusation

00:12:55.378 --> 00:12:57.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:12:58.715 --> 00:13:00.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s brilliant!

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:02.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:05.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will beg for our help.

00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:07.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
These opposers threatened the Jews,

00:13:07.682 --> 00:13:09.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
schemed against them,

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:12.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even accused Nehemiah of treason.

00:13:14.898 --> 00:13:17.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah’s peace and the peace

00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Jews supporting the work was threatened.

00:13:20.737 --> 00:13:24.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
But despite the attempts of opposers,

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:27.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah and the Jews looked to Jehovah

00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:30.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
for guidance and kept working.

00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah declares his purpose,

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:38.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is nothing that can prevent him

00:13:38.797 --> 00:13:40.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
from carrying it out.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah wanted a rebuilt Jerusalem,

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:47.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
complete with rebuilt walls,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah would have
complete faith in Jehovah’s ability

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:53.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the rebuilding efforts.

00:13:53.603 --> 00:13:55.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with this support,

00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:58.358 line:10% position:50% align:center
the city walls were completed

00:13:58.358 --> 00:14:01.277 line:10% position:50% align:center
in just 52 days.

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:05.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah, the wall is complete!

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s it.

00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:16.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
With rebuilt walls and a rebuilt temple,

00:14:16.084 --> 00:14:19.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically the city was in good condition.

00:14:19.337 --> 00:14:22.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, about 12 years later,

00:14:22.632 --> 00:14:25.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah returned to Shushan.

00:14:25.927 --> 00:14:30.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his prolonged absence,
the spiritual state of the Jews deteriorated.

00:14:30.432 --> 00:14:32.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so sad,

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:35.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
as many in Israel
fell back into bad practices.

00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:37.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some in the priesthood,

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:40.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
including High Priest Eliashib,

00:14:40.442 --> 00:14:42.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer took their responsibilities seriously.

00:14:43.778 --> 00:14:46.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, Jehovah raised up the prophet Malachi 

00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:48.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counsel the negligent priests.

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why have you Levites despised Jehovah’s name?

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:53.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despised it?

00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
You present a blind,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
lame, or sick animal as a sacrifice

00:14:57.792 --> 00:14:59.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say that it is nothing bad.

00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:01.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:15:01.588 --> 00:15:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s another thing you do

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:04.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he no longer

00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:06.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks favorably on anything you offer.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you betray the wife of your youth,

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:12.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
although she’s your partner, your legal wife.

00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:14.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lips of a priest

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:16.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
should safeguard knowledge,

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:19.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people should seek the law from his mouth.

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:21.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you,

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:23.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have made many stumble.

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, Malachi’s words

00:15:28.364 --> 00:15:30.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
had little effect on the priesthood.

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:35.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite his warnings,
the people refused to change.

00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Nehemiah returned,
what he found shocked him.

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:41.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a long time,

00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:42.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
the priests and the Levites

00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:44.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
have not taken their duties seriously.

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:46.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the people saw that,

00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:47.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:49.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the tithes,

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:51.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
most Levites and singers

00:15:51.888 --> 00:15:53.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
returned to their fields.

00:15:53.264 --> 00:15:54.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Eliashib

00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:56.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
not tell the people to bring your provisions?

00:15:57.352 --> 00:15:58.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your absence,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Malachi warned him

00:16:00.313 --> 00:16:02.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the priests.

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Eliashib—

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:06.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took our storeroom

00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:08.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and emptied it of our provisions.

00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:11.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave it to Tobiah to use as a dining hall.

00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:14.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:16.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
to no longer providing
financial support,

00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:19.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people started
conducting business on the Sabbath.

00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:22.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you selling today?

00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:26.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only the best quality fish from Tyre.

00:16:28.424 --> 00:16:29.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were marrying foreign women.

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:31.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m marrying Gizla today.

00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gizla?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Moabite girl?

00:16:36.474 --> 00:16:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard you bind yourself with an oath

00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:40.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a curse not to take a wife from the nations!

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:44.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
This action could have disrupted

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:45.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
the line to the Messiah,

00:16:45.942 --> 00:16:49.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it definitely threatened
to contaminate pure worship.

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:52.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men were bringing the restored nation

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:55.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
into disfavor with Jehovah.

00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:58.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the same reason
why Jehovah allowed Babylon

00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:01.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy Jerusalem in the first place.

00:17:01.624 --> 00:17:06.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Nehemiah took action
against these faithless ones.

00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:13.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please cleanse this room

00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:14.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and replace the utensils.

00:17:14.596 --> 00:17:15.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:17:15.054 --> 00:17:15.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my lord.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And gather all the Levites,

00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:18.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
the singers, and the deputy rulers to me.

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:20.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m assigning them all back to their posts.

00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:23.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
He enforced the strict observance

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:24.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Sabbath. 

00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:25.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the meaning of this?

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:27.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:17:27.984 --> 00:17:30.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know God’s Law:

00:17:30.403 --> 00:17:32.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
No work,

00:17:32.322 --> 00:17:34.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
no business on the Sabbath!

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:35.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go!

00:17:35.283 --> 00:17:37.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
You and all the Levites, guard the gates

00:17:37.493 --> 00:17:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep the Sabbath holy.

00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:41.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let anyone in!

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:46.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
He disciplined those
who had taken foreign wives.

00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:50.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:51.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:17:51.758 --> 00:17:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:56.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you not?

00:17:56.429 --> 00:17:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes! Yes!

00:17:57.513 --> 00:17:59.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah 

00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:02.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your own oath?

00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:04.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:07.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
was guiding Nehemiah’s efforts all along.

00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:10.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a spiritual cleansing was done,

00:18:10.944 --> 00:18:14.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
a measure of peace was again enjoyed.

00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:16.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with this vigorous

00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:18.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
rooting out of apostasy,

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
the record of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:22.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes to a close.

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:28.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we don’t have
an inspired record of events

00:18:28.753 --> 00:18:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the centuries leading up to Jesus’ birth,

00:18:31.714 --> 00:18:33.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
but history shows that Jerusalem

00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:36.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
underwent several changes during these years.

00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:38.888 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Medo-Persian Empire

00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:40.515 line:10% position:50% align:center
was overtaken by Greece,

00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:42.892 line:10% position:50% align:center
represented by the copper belly and thighs

00:18:42.892 --> 00:18:45.019 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.

00:18:46.354 --> 00:18:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the city seemed to survive
the change in control

00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:52.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
without any physical damage,
its spiritual state was threatened.

00:18:53.444 --> 00:18:56.489 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Greek Empire set the stage for the spread

00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:59.659 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Greek language, culture, and religious thought,

00:19:00.785 --> 00:19:03.538 line:10% position:50% align:center
and Israel was affected by this influence.

00:19:04.914 --> 00:19:07.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years later, King Antiochus IV

00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
was determined to eradicate
Jewish worship and customs.

00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:14.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went so far as to sacrifice a pig

00:19:14.507 --> 00:19:15.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Greek god Zeus

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:18.261 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the temple of Jehovah.

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:20.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a vicious attempt

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:23.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
to defile and to stamp out pure worship.

00:19:23.016 --> 00:19:26.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the desecration
had the opposite effect.

00:19:26.185 --> 00:19:28.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sparked an uprising

00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:30.857 line:10% position:50% align:center
of zealous Jews, and three years later,

00:19:30.857 --> 00:19:32.233 line:10% position:50% align:center
they cleansed the temple

00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:34.235 line:10% position:50% align:center
and rededicated it to Jehovah.

00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:37.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
About a century later,

00:19:37.864 --> 00:19:40.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem experienced
another change in rulership

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:44.162 line:10% position:50% align:center
as Rome became the dominant world power.

00:19:45.955 --> 00:19:48.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rome corresponded to the legs of iron

00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:50.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.

00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:52.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the rule

00:19:52.045 --> 00:19:53.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Herod the Great,

00:19:53.379 --> 00:19:56.215 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem enjoyed considerable prosperity.

00:19:56.215 --> 00:19:58.342 line:10% position:50% align:center
Herod’s greatest work, however,

00:19:58.342 --> 00:20:00.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the reconstruction of the temple

00:20:00.553 --> 00:20:02.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its building complex.

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:04.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
The temple and its daily sacrifices

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
remained in operation down to Jesus’ day.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible record picks up

00:20:08.936 --> 00:20:10.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Jesus was born.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah have mercy on us!

00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:29.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s happening?

00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:30.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the sun up already?

00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:32.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they . . .

00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:34.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
are they . . . angels?

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:35.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be afraid,

00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:37.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
for look!

00:20:37.256 --> 00:20:39.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am declaring to you good news

00:20:39.092 --> 00:20:41.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a great joy that all the people will have.

00:20:41.636 --> 00:20:43.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
For today there was born

00:20:43.638 --> 00:20:46.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
to you in David’s city a savior, 

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is Christ the Lord.

00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:50.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ birth and ministry

00:20:50.311 --> 00:20:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
fulfilled many prophecies.

00:20:52.355 --> 00:20:56.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 29 C.E., Jehovah
anointed Jesus with holy spirit.

00:20:56.901 --> 00:21:00.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
This corresponds exactly
to the words of Daniel’s prophecy

00:21:00.947 --> 00:21:04.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah gave him
more than 500 years earlier.

00:21:04.033 --> 00:21:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
The promised Messiah had arrived!

00:21:07.995 --> 00:21:11.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in his ministry, Jesus read these words

00:21:11.707 --> 00:21:15.378 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the prophecy of Isaiah.

00:21:15.378 --> 00:21:18.881 line:10% position:50% align:center
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet reads:

00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:22.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s spirit is upon me,

00:21:22.552 --> 00:21:24.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because he anointed me

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:27.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to declare good news to the poor.

00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:29.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He sent me

00:21:29.225 --> 00:21:30.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim liberty to the captives 

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:33.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a recovery of sight to the blind,

00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:35.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to send the crushed ones away free,

00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:39.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.”

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:50.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today this scripture

00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:52.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:22:00.756 --> 00:22:03.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holy spirit empowered Jesus to perform

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
many miracles
in just a few short years on earth.

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:10.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
This had a profound effect
on the people living in his day.

00:22:10.433 --> 00:22:13.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am a very sick woman.

00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:16.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve suffered from a flow of blood

00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:18.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some 12 years.

00:22:18.691 --> 00:22:20.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can heal me!

00:22:20.943 --> 00:22:23.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if I could touch

00:22:23.112 --> 00:22:25.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
just the fringes

00:22:25.156 --> 00:22:28.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his outer garment, I will get well!

00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:41.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who touched my outer garment?

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who touched me?

00:22:43.466 --> 00:22:46.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, . . .

00:22:46.552 --> 00:22:48.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
please forgive me, my Lord.

00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:51.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was I who touched you!

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:54.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have faith in you!

00:22:54.227 --> 00:22:57.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that if I could just touch

00:22:57.688 --> 00:23:00.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fringes of your outer garment,

00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:02.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could get well.

00:23:03.736 --> 00:23:05.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take courage, daughter!

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your faith has made you well.

00:23:12.328 --> 00:23:14.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
The miracles Jesus performed were unlike

00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:16.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
anything the people had seen before.

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:20.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, the people had hope

00:23:20.002 --> 00:23:23.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a hope for the future, a hope for peace.

00:23:23.923 --> 00:23:28.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even demonstrated that he had power
far beyond any human ruler.

00:23:30.304 --> 00:23:32.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord, Mary is here!

00:23:40.564 --> 00:23:41.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord!

00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you had been here,

00:23:44.026 --> 00:23:46.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
my brother would not have died!

00:23:55.246 --> 00:23:56.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lazarus!

00:23:56.622 --> 00:23:58.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come out!

00:24:16.517 --> 00:24:18.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Free him, and let him go!

00:24:21.147 --> 00:24:23.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is so much we can learn

00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:26.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jesus’ miracles, works, and teachings.

00:24:26.777 --> 00:24:30.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reveal Jehovah’s purpose and power.

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:31.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
They show how enjoyable,

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:36.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
how peaceful life will be
under God’s Messianic Ruler.

00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:40.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans alive at this time
could see visible proof of this.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ ministry accomplished so much

00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:46.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just three and a half years.

00:24:46.464 --> 00:24:48.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
And prophecy regarding the Messiah

00:24:48.883 --> 00:24:52.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued to be fulfilled
as his opposers succeeded

00:24:52.553 --> 00:24:54.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
in putting him to death.

00:25:06.525 --> 00:25:08.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the sacrifice

00:25:08.152 --> 00:25:09.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ perfect human life,

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire arrangement

00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:13.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
for worshipping Jehovah had changed.

00:25:13.741 --> 00:25:17.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no longer a need
for animal sacrifices.

00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:22.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pure worship was no longer centered
around the temple in Jerusalem.

00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:27.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only way to worship Jehovah acceptably
was through the Messiah.

00:25:27.296 --> 00:25:31.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now people everywhere
could find the way to peace

00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:34.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
through faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:37.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jewish system of worship

00:25:37.473 --> 00:25:39.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the Mosaic Law was over.

00:25:39.517 --> 00:25:42.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
no longer had Jehovah’s favor.

00:25:42.978 --> 00:25:45.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ perfect human sacrifice

00:25:45.606 --> 00:25:48.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the only solution for lasting peace.

00:25:48.692 --> 00:25:53.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did this mean
for the city of Jerusalem and the temple?

00:25:53.697 --> 00:25:55.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, before his death,

00:25:55.699 --> 00:25:58.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus provided his followers with a warning

00:25:58.411 --> 00:26:00.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jerusalem’s destruction.

00:26:00.663 --> 00:26:04.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 21:20, 21, he says:

00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:06.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When you see Jerusalem

00:26:06.293 --> 00:26:08.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“surrounded by encamped armies,

00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:10.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then know that the desolating of her

00:26:10.631 --> 00:26:11.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has drawn near. . . .

00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:14.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let those in the midst of her leave,

00:26:14.593 --> 00:26:18.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let those in the countryside
not enter into her.”

00:26:18.264 --> 00:26:21.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good ruler guides his people.

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:25.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although it wasn’t yet time for him
to take the throne as Ruler of God’s Kingdom,

00:26:25.354 --> 00:26:30.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus (by the way he acted) gave us insight
into the kind of ruler he would be.

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:34.655 line:10% position:50% align:center
By providing first-century Christians

00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:36.740 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a warning to leave Jerusalem

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.117 line:10% position:50% align:center
and all Judea,

00:26:38.117 --> 00:26:41.245 line:10% position:50% align:center
he was guiding them and protecting them.

00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:44.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus prophesied the destruction of the city,

00:26:44.123 --> 00:26:46.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just a few decades later,

00:26:46.208 --> 00:26:48.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
that prophecy came true.

00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:51.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Roman Empire still had control of Judea,

00:26:51.797 --> 00:26:53.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tensions ran high

00:26:53.382 --> 00:26:55.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the Romans and the Jews.

00:26:55.634 --> 00:26:57.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, the Jews

00:26:57.261 --> 00:26:58.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
revolted against Roman rule.

00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:14.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the city surrounded

00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:15.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Roman forces closing in,

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:17.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seemed there was no way out.

00:27:17.948 --> 00:27:21.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s word cannot go unfulfilled.

00:27:21.994 --> 00:27:23.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
For no apparent reason,

00:27:23.329 --> 00:27:25.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Roman forces withdrew!

00:27:29.502 --> 00:27:31.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
For faithful Christians,

00:27:31.504 --> 00:27:33.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was their opportunity.

00:27:34.757 --> 00:27:36.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s simple:

00:27:36.759 --> 00:27:38.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who followed Jesus’ direction

00:27:38.802 --> 00:27:41.472 line:10% position:50% align:center
to leave Judea were guided to safety.

00:27:41.472 --> 00:27:43.474 line:10% position:50% align:center
For those who delayed,

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:47.353 line:10% position:50% align:center
escape became difficult or impossible.

00:27:54.193 --> 00:27:56.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no doubt

00:27:56.278 --> 00:28:00.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jerusalem no longer enjoyed
Jehovah’s special favor and protection.

00:28:07.289 --> 00:28:09.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city and its temple

00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:11.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
were completely destroyed.

00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:25.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are parallels we can draw
from the warning Jesus gave

00:28:25.808 --> 00:28:28.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those first-century Christians

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:31.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the warning we
have been given for our day.

00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:33.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus gave us one composite sign

00:28:33.857 --> 00:28:37.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that indicates the destruction
of this current system of things

00:28:37.194 --> 00:28:39.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
is very close.

00:28:39.238 --> 00:28:42.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prophecies in the Bible give us no doubt

00:28:42.783 --> 00:28:45.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are living in “the last days.”

00:28:45.035 --> 00:28:49.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has not revealed all the details
of how everything will work out.

00:28:49.373 --> 00:28:53.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know that everything
he has revealed will come true.

00:28:53.502 --> 00:28:56.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes details outlining
how world events

00:28:56.797 --> 00:28:59.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
would unfold in the time
of the end

00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:02.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
before mankind
would experience permanent peace.

00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:06.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Daniel’s prophecy indicated

00:29:06.432 --> 00:29:10.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there would be
only one dominant world power in place

00:29:10.144 --> 00:29:11.770 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the time of the end.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.314 line:10% position:50% align:center
By World War I,

00:29:13.314 --> 00:29:15.149 line:10% position:50% align:center
the power represented by the feet 

00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:17.526 line:10% position:50% align:center
of iron and clay had emerged.

00:29:17.526 --> 00:29:20.779 line:10% position:50% align:center
During that war, Britain and America

00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:22.740 line:10% position:50% align:center
forged a partnership

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.909 line:10% position:50% align:center
that continued through the Second World War.

00:29:28.162 --> 00:29:30.414 line:10% position:50% align:center
This means a special relationship

00:29:30.414 --> 00:29:33.500 line:10% position:50% align:center
between the British Commonwealth and Empire

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.045 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the United States of America.

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:39.048 line:10% position:50% align:center
Neither the sure prevention of war

00:29:39.048 --> 00:29:42.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
nor the continuous rise

00:29:42.051 --> 00:29:45.054 line:10% position:50% align:center
of world organization will begin

00:29:45.054 --> 00:29:48.098 line:10% position:50% align:center
without what I have called

00:29:48.098 --> 00:29:49.391 line:10% position:50% align:center
the fraternal association

00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:51.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the English-speaking people.

00:29:56.774 --> 00:29:58.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
These two countries

00:29:58.817 --> 00:30:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to be a dual
English-speaking world power.

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:04.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
The characteristics of iron and clay

00:30:04.823 --> 00:30:07.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to represent
this world power are significant.

00:30:08.952 --> 00:30:10.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the toes of the feet

00:30:10.954 --> 00:30:13.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:15.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the kingdom

00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:19.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be partly strong and partly fragile.

00:30:23.258 --> 00:30:25.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the United States and Britain

00:30:25.636 --> 00:30:27.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
have displayed ironlike strength

00:30:27.763 --> 00:30:30.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
through their involvement in armed conflicts.

00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:36.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, iron mixed with clay
is considerably weakened.

00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can be observed as common people

00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:42.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
undermined the Anglo-American
World Power’s ability

00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:44.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
to act with ironlike strength.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the political and social developments

00:30:48.992 --> 00:30:51.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
foretold in the Bible come to a climax,

00:30:51.787 --> 00:30:53.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a measure of peace.

00:30:53.956 --> 00:30:56.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know Jehovah will guide his people,

00:30:56.625 --> 00:31:01.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
even as the world’s spiritual
and moral condition sinks to new depths.

00:31:03.424 --> 00:31:05.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
As many in first-century Jerusalem

00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:07.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued their lives

00:31:07.594 --> 00:31:09.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if nothing had changed,

00:31:09.722 --> 00:31:11.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
so, too, today many

00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:13.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue on with their lives.

00:31:13.976 --> 00:31:15.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, we remain alert

00:31:15.978 --> 00:31:18.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we see fulfillment of Bible prophecy

00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
right before our eyes.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the days of those kings,

00:31:23.944 --> 00:31:27.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:31:27.614 --> 00:31:29.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will never be destroyed.

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:32.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Revelation

00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:34.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us what will soon happen.

00:31:34.788 --> 00:31:38.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
The political rulers of the world
will give the United Nations

00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:41.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
unprecedented power and authority.

00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:44.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul foretold
that the nations will declare

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace and security!”

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:49.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it won’t prove to be true peace.

00:31:52.639 --> 00:31:54.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
The nations supporting the UN

00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
will attack the institutions
of false religion.

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:09.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a coalition of earth’s governments
that the prophet Ezekiel

00:32:09.072 --> 00:32:11.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
calls “Gog of the land of Magog”

00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:13.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
will attack God’s people.

00:32:13.702 --> 00:32:17.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we don’t need to be fearful.

00:32:17.456 --> 00:32:19.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when we can put into action

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:21.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the lessons we’ve learned.

00:32:21.752 --> 00:32:25.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who trust and obey Jehovah’s guidance

00:32:25.464 --> 00:32:28.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
can look to the near future with confidence.

00:32:28.008 --> 00:32:31.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve seen, Jehovah has always been

00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:33.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
in control of the situation.

00:32:33.013 --> 00:32:35.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has never guided his people

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:38.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a certain direction
but then failed to provide for them.

00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:41.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we can say
that the lessons we learn

00:32:41.522 --> 00:32:43.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the faithful men we’ve studied

00:32:43.524 --> 00:32:45.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
are more than just lessons.

00:32:45.526 --> 00:32:50.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has been Jehovah
paving the way for peace from the start.

00:32:50.364 --> 00:32:55.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, we see exactly
how Jehovah has led his people.

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:59.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took many years,
but he’s been in control the whole time.

00:32:59.248 --> 00:33:03.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it make sense
to think he isn’t in control anymore?

00:33:03.001 --> 00:33:06.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
No power in heaven or on earth

00:33:06.004 --> 00:33:09.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
can prevent Jehovah
from accomplishing his express purpose.

00:33:09.967 --> 00:33:12.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has never relinquished control,

00:33:12.803 --> 00:33:15.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is still guiding his people.

00:33:15.931 --> 00:33:17.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think about this:

00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:22.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah has guided
his people to this point,

00:33:22.187 --> 00:33:24.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can have full confidence

00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:27.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
that trust and obedience to his direction

00:33:27.317 --> 00:33:30.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
will prove to be our salvation,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if a way out seems impossible.

00:33:34.324 --> 00:33:37.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is all-powerful!

00:33:37.828 --> 00:33:42.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to help us
through whatever we may face.

00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:48.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t have to fight,

00:33:56.471 --> 00:33:58.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we won’t need to fear annihilation.

00:33:58.432 --> 00:34:01.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has things

00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:03.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
under control.

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:06.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this kingdom

00:34:06.106 --> 00:34:08.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will not be passed on to any other people.

00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:13.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will crush and put an end

00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to all these kingdoms.

00:34:31.715 --> 00:34:34.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it alone will stand forever.”

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom will fill

00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:39.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and renew the entire earth.

00:34:43.477 --> 00:34:45.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promises

00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:47.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be completely fulfilled.

00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:52.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lasting peace will finally become

00:34:52.152 --> 00:34:55.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reality for all mankind.

00:34:55.155 --> 00:34:58.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just imagine what faithful servants

00:34:58.283 --> 00:35:01.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
have to look forward to
under Jesus’ heavenly rule!

00:35:01.536 --> 00:35:06.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will be able to provide
what no man ever could.

00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:10.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what that will be like?

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For look!

00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:35.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am creating new heavens and a new earth;

00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:38.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the former things
will not be called to mind,

00:35:42.035 --> 00:35:44.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor will they come up into the heart.”

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:51.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,

00:35:53.296 --> 00:35:56.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will live forever on it.”

00:36:17.362 --> 00:36:19.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will swallow up death forever,

00:36:22.242 --> 00:36:26.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
will wipe away the tears from all faces.”

00:36:36.089 --> 00:36:40.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will wipe out every tear from their eyes,

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:42.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and death will be no more, 

00:36:42.054 --> 00:36:44.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither will mourning

00:36:44.139 --> 00:36:47.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:36:49.686 --> 00:36:51.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:37:18.507 --> 00:37:21.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time the eyes

00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:25.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the blind will be opened,

00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:28.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:37.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time the lame

00:37:37.192 --> 00:37:39.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will leap like the deer,

00:37:40.862 --> 00:37:43.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the tongue of the speechless

00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:45.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will shout for joy.

00:37:50.205 --> 00:37:52.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For waters will burst forth

00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:54.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the wilderness,

00:37:57.295 --> 00:38:00.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and streams in the desert plain.”

00:38:07.472 --> 00:38:09.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses and live in them,

00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:22.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.”

00:38:33.582 --> 00:38:37.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:38:38.628 --> 00:38:41.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the work of their hands

00:38:42.257 --> 00:38:45.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:38:48.638 --> 00:38:51.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:38:55.395 --> 00:38:58.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will find exquisite delight

00:38:58.023 --> 00:39:01.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the abundance of peace.”

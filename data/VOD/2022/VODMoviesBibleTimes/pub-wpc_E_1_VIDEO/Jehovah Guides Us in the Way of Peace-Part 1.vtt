WEBVTT

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our military forces are committed to peace.

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have chosen peace.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our wish, our prayer, is for peace.

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
We yearn for peace.

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for peace.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
For thousands

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
of years, humans have tried

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find peace

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peace as individuals,

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace as families,

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace for the entire human race.

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to lay the foundation of peace
for generations to come.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to do the hard work now

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
so our children and our grandchildren
can grow up in a peaceful world.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
The future we want:

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
opportunity and security for our families,

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
a rising standard of living,

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all that is within our reach.

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, despite humans’ best efforts,

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been elusive.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
For millenniums,

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:04.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
rulers and governments
have tried to achieve peace

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
through treaties,

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
resolutions,

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
summits

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, ironically, war.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our peace as humans
is more fragile than ever.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.294 line:10% position:50% align:center
Man’s efforts to bring about lasting peace

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.339 line:10% position:50% align:center
have failed time and time again.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.926 line:10% position:50% align:center
This isn’t surprising to us.

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.638 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 10:23 tells us:

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:44.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man . . .
to direct his step.”

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:49.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans were simply not designed
to rule themselves.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.235 line:10% position:50% align:center
Good health, safety, overall well-being

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:55.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
—these are becoming harder to find

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:56.947 line:10% position:50% align:center
as we move further into what the Bible

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:00.034 line:10% position:50% align:center
refers to as “the last days.”

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:02.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
As long as human rule continues,

00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:05.664 line:10% position:50% align:center
disunity will continue.

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:07.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s true that global peace

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.086 line:10% position:50% align:center
cannot be obtained by human efforts alone.

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.005 line:10% position:50% align:center
But those who are close to God

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.632 line:10% position:50% align:center
can find peace of mind right now.

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 48:17, 18 says:

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:25.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One guiding you

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:27.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the way you should walk.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:30.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If only you would pay attention

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:31.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to my commandments!

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then your peace

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
would become just like a river.”

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s only Jehovah

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:40.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
who has the ability to guide humans

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:43.035 line:10% position:50% align:center
to real, lasting peace.

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.287 line:10% position:50% align:center
He promises he will bring this about.

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until this happens,

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:49.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continues to provide ways

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to experience peace now.

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:53.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do that?

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
By giving us “the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding.”

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
We aren’t the only ones
whose peace has been challenged.

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:18.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word is filled
with accounts of faithful servants

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose peace was challenged

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the dominating forces of their day.

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:26.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we study and meditate on these accounts,

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lessons we learn from them

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:34.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to trust in Jehovah
as he guides us to peace.

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:38.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding how these accounts
relate to Jehovah’s purpose to bring peace

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:41.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of his Messianic Kingdom
gives us confidence

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his purpose never fails

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:47.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will support
and guide us on into the future.

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:48.976 line:10% position:50% align:center
One of Jehovah’s prophets

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:52.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
who learned this lesson firsthand was Jonah.

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:57.151 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jonah lived in the ninth century B.C.E.

00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:00.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assigned Jonah to go to Nineveh,

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
a city of the Assyrian Empire.

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on what he knew about Nineveh,

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah considered this to be

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:08.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
an intimidating and threatening assignment.

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Assyrians were known as fierce warriors,

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Nineveh itself was later described

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a “city of bloodshed.”

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:22.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you can understand Jonah’s trepidation
when Jehovah asks him

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proclaim a judgment message

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
against this imposing city

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:27.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its pagan inhabitants.

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:34.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an attempt to find peace,

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah decides to go far away from Nineveh

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and boards a boat headed for Tarshish.

00:05:45.532 --> 00:05:47.367 line:10% position:50% align:center
Tarshish is generally associated

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.119 line:10% position:50% align:center
with modern-day Spain.

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:50.704 line:10% position:50% align:center
So from Israel,

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:52.581 line:10% position:50% align:center
this is the complete opposite direction

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Nineveh.

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:00.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah found anything but peace.

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:07.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:14.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the gods.

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:16.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Furl the sail!

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was no ordinary storm.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.201 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was so severe that the ship

00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:30.869 line:10% position:50% align:center
was in danger of being wrecked.

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Captain, we’re taking on too much water!

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
This storm is from the gods!

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:37.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baal!

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:39.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eshmun!

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
The crew cried out to their gods,

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:45.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jonah knew the true Source of the storm.

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:47.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now he accepts

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
personal responsibility for the situation.

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:52.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lift me up

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:54.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and throw me into the sea,

00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:56.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sea will calm down for you;

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:58.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I know that it’s because of me

00:06:58.897 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this violent storm has come upon you.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:06.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the courage it took

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:08.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jonah to make this request?

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:12.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had no way of knowing
if Jehovah would save him,

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:16.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he did not want others
to perish on his account.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his mercy, Jehovah spares Jonah’s life.

00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:34.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
How am I still alive?

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:36.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will become of me?

00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:38.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
When faced

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:40.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a difficult assignment,

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:43.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah “got up to run away from Jehovah

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Tarshish.”

00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:47.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah’s conscience had to bother him;

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:50.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had to be questioning his decision.

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:53.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tried to take matters into his own hands,

00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:56.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
tried to find his own peace.

00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where does he find himself?

00:07:58.623 --> 00:08:00.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the belly of a fish!

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet he calls to Jehovah
in a moment of despair.

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:07.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah,

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:12.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of the depths of the Grave,

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cry to you for help.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:18.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please hear my voice.

00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:24.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I have vowed, I will pay.

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:27.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah could have reasoned

00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:31.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this was the end
of his assignment as Jehovah’s prophet.

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:37.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, he did disobey direction.

00:08:39.122 --> 00:08:41.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
So likely, he was surprised

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:43.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear the word of Jehovah come to him

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
a second time.

00:08:52.636 --> 00:08:54.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah!

00:08:54.763 --> 00:08:56.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get up,

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:59.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to Nineveh the great city,

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:00.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
and proclaim to her

00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
the message that I tell you.

00:09:05.482 --> 00:09:07.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:08.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:10.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:09:16.243 --> 00:09:19.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, Jonah trusted in himself

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:20.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and didn’t understand

00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:24.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would protect him
from the violent Assyrians.

00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:26.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after being given
a second chance, what happens?

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:28.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then he puts aside

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
his human concerns

00:09:32.217 --> 00:09:34.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looks to Jehovah for protection.

00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:45.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just 40 days more,

00:09:45.147 --> 00:09:48.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nineveh will be overthrown.

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:50.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, the true God, has spoken.

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:53.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
This city will be destroyed.

00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:55.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nineveh will be overthrown.

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:58.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
The true God will overthrow Nineveh.

00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:03.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
The true God has spoken.

00:10:03.874 --> 00:10:05.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, the king himself repents

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:07.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and orders everyone

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:09.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Nineveh to do the same.

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:12.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah learned a valuable lesson

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this experience.

00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:17.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
By originally running away from Nineveh,

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
he chose to trust in himself

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:22.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than putting his trust in Jehovah.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you Jonah?

00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:27.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am.

00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:29.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mommy says you saved us.

00:10:30.984 --> 00:10:33.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah saved you.

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:39.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just—I was just a messenger.

00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:43.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah learned

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:44.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
that without a doubt

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:47.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah protects those
who trust and obey Him.

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah has asked you to do something,

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:52.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he’s asked me to do something,

00:10:52.088 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he’s leading us,

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:57.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
he absolutely will guide us through it.

00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:00.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah’s account proves this.

00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the Ninevites were spared

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:07.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they repented (that’s true),

00:11:07.103 --> 00:11:09.147 line:10% position:50% align:center
Assyria later

00:11:09.147 --> 00:11:11.650 line:10% position:50% align:center
returned to its evil, wicked ways.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
About a century

00:11:13.902 --> 00:11:16.029 line:10% position:50% align:center
after Jonah’s judgment message,

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:18.782 line:10% position:50% align:center
King Sennacherib of Assyria brought

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:21.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
his armies against the cities of Judah,

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:23.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the city he wanted most

00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:25.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jerusalem.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Hezekiah of Judah

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:30.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
was an outstanding king

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
who “held fast to Jehovah.”

00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:35.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the beginning of his reign,

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:37.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
he proved to be zealous for true worship

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:40.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only in Judah but in all of Israel.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:44.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah had done so much
to stand up for pure worship,

00:11:44.724 --> 00:11:47.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet now he is faced with the prospect

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:48.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a siege against Jerusalem

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:50.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Sennacherib’s armies.

00:11:55.485 --> 00:11:57.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah agrees to pay Sennacherib

00:11:57.571 --> 00:11:59.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
a tribute in return for peace.

00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:03.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, the armies continue their conquests,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Sennacherib and his men besiege

00:12:05.662 --> 00:12:07.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
the strongly fortified city of Lachish.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
From here,

00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:14.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sennacherib sends a part of his army

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:18.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as military chiefs to Jerusalem

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an attempt to demand surrender.

00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:23.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spokesman for the group was the Rabshakeh,

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:25.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
who spoke Hebrew fluently.

00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:29.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loudly ridiculed Hezekiah

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:31.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and taunted Jehovah,

00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:35.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
boasting that Jehovah
was no match against King Sennacherib.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
Imagine what these soldiers

00:12:37.193 --> 00:12:38.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
must have been thinking.

00:12:38.486 --> 00:12:41.531 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sennacherib’s armies were on a warpath,

00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:44.117 line:10% position:50% align:center
taking city after city.

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:48.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
To Hezekiah, this was a defining moment.

00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:52.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to decide if he would trust in himself

00:12:52.042 --> 00:12:54.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
or trust in Jehovah.

00:12:58.548 --> 00:12:59.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
My brothers,

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must remember that Jehovah

00:13:02.218 --> 00:13:03.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
is fully able to rescue us,

00:13:03.303 --> 00:13:04.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he has in times past.

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:05.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word . . .

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Hezekiah,

00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:11.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
will you not even now face the facts?

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are trapped!

00:13:13.813 --> 00:13:15.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Assyrians are at our gate,

00:13:15.857 --> 00:13:17.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you cling to the belief

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:19.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
that nothing bad will happen.

00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:21.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will destroy everything

00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:22.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
you so hope to preserve

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the temple, Jerusalem,

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:25.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
our very lives.

00:13:25.992 --> 00:13:26.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shebna, I am not blind

00:13:26.826 --> 00:13:29.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the dangers that we face.

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:31.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
I too am afraid.

00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:32.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if Jehovah

00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:33.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows Jerusalem to fall,

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:35.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
so be it.

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:38.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we give up what belongs to Jehovah?

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as a man of faith,

00:13:42.342 --> 00:13:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah focused on Jehovah’s ability

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save His people

00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:50.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite Sennacherib’s
continued advances toward Jerusalem.

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:57.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m curious about this king of yours.

00:13:57.607 --> 00:13:59.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who does he think

00:13:59.192 --> 00:14:01.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come to save him from me?

00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:07.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, your God,

00:14:07.158 --> 00:14:08.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
is weak!

00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:13.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will cringe before my god Asshur.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah remained

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:20.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
determined to trust in Jehovah.

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:25.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
This decision required
a tremendous amount of faith,

00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially with more than

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:31.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
185,000 Assyrian soldiers

00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
headed toward Jerusalem.

00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of trusting in himself,

00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:41.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
he continued to look

00:14:41.693 --> 00:14:46.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah as the Source of true peace

00:14:46.114 --> 00:14:48.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
even as an attack seemed imminent.

00:14:53.788 --> 00:14:55.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah again

00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:59.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed just how insignificant

00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:03.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
human rulers are in comparison to him.

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:22.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah learned

00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:24.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when a way out seems impossible,

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:28.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting in Jehovah always leads to success.

00:15:29.407 --> 00:15:33.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rewarded that trust
with victory over the Assyrians.

00:15:33.244 --> 00:15:38.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a lesson
we can apply now and in the near future.

00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:41.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may be situations
when true worshippers seem trapped,

00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:46.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never forget
that Jehovah is all-powerful.

00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:48.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s leading his people,

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:51.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can follow
his guidance with full confidence.

00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:55.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will protect those
who trust in him at Armageddon.

00:15:56.184 --> 00:15:58.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem remained safe

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:00.939 line:10% position:50% align:center
against attack for the time being,

00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:04.359 line:10% position:50% align:center
but peaceful conditions didn’t last long.

00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:08.446 line:10% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah’s son Manasseh

00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:10.490 line:10% position:50% align:center
did what was detestable

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:13.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brought back Baal worship

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:16.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and personally took its vilest practices

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
to extremes,

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:19.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
even putting a carved image of a false god

00:16:19.916 --> 00:16:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
right inside Jehovah’s temple.

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here you have a king

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:28.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s supposed to be protecting
the people from idolatrous influence

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing the exact opposite
—building altars to false gods.

00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:36.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even went so far
as to pass his own sons through the fire,

00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:38.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacrificing them to these gods.

00:16:38.977 --> 00:16:41.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace with God that Hezekiah

00:16:41.354 --> 00:16:44.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked so hard to achieve for the nation

00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:47.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
is now reversed by the actions of his son.

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:49.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this,

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah punished Manasseh severely.

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:53.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed the king of Assyria

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:55.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take him captive to Babylon.

00:16:55.869 --> 00:16:57.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
While in captivity,

00:16:57.996 --> 00:17:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Manasseh ultimately repented.

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbled himself,

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he stayed faithful

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
right to the end of his life.

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:06.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grandfather!

00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:08.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can imagine him impressing

00:17:08.464 --> 00:17:10.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
the importance of faithfulness

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah on his young grandson Josiah.

00:17:13.469 --> 00:17:15.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to me.

00:17:16.514 --> 00:17:19.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is holy,

00:17:20.184 --> 00:17:22.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you must serve him

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way he wants us to.

00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:28.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
All other gods

00:17:29.861 --> 00:17:31.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
are powerless.

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:33.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, in spite of all this,

00:17:34.699 --> 00:17:36.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people still thought

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:39.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could serve Jehovah and Baal.

00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:42.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after becoming king,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.710 line:10% position:50% align:center
Josiah started a campaign against idolatry.

00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:48.087 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen these cheaper.

00:17:49.714 --> 00:17:51.549 line:10% position:50% align:center
Take it or leave it.

00:17:58.431 --> 00:18:00.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
We start here!

00:18:02.477 --> 00:18:03.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:18.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what we will do to every false god in the land.

00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tore down altars used for false worship,

00:18:24.707 --> 00:18:27.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacred poles, images, and statues.

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:30.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was intent 
on cleansing the land of idolatry.

00:18:30.838 --> 00:18:33.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he showed remarkable courage

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:38.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stand up for true worship
at a time when few were doing so.

00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:43.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt this was a difficult task.

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:45.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, he may have even wondered

00:18:45.728 --> 00:18:47.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was doing the right thing.

00:18:47.522 --> 00:18:49.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible Jehovah provided Josiah

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
with assurance from the prophet Jeremiah.

00:18:54.487 --> 00:18:57.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jehovah says: “Look!

00:18:57.991 --> 00:18:59.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A son named Josiah

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:02.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be born to the house of David!

00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:05.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will sacrifice on you

00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:07.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the priests of the high places,

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:10.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those making sacrificial smoke on you,

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:14.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will burn human bones on you.”

00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:17.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
That prophecy

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
made over 300 years earlier confirmed

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:27.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Josiah was the one
prophesied to act against false worship.

00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:31.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may have given Josiah
even greater incentive and courage

00:19:31.232 --> 00:19:32.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue his campaign,

00:19:33.401 --> 00:19:35.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
which now included repairing the temple.

00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:38.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
These actions contributed

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:39.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the peaceful conditions

00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:42.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
that elevated pure worship.

00:19:43.244 --> 00:19:45.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josiah did so much

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:46.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
to restore pure worship.

00:19:46.456 --> 00:19:48.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we love him.

00:19:48.332 --> 00:19:51.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, the peoples’ heart condition
remained polluted,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the nation required severe discipline.

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:56.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah prophesied

00:19:56.758 --> 00:19:58.301 line:10% position:50% align:center
a conquest of the Babylonians

00:19:58.301 --> 00:20:00.344 line:10% position:50% align:center
against Judah.

00:20:00.344 --> 00:20:02.388 line:10% position:50% align:center
All this land

00:20:02.388 --> 00:20:04.140 line:10% position:50% align:center
will be reduced to ruins,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this land and its inhabitants

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:08.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have to serve the king of Babylon

00:20:08.144 --> 00:20:10.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 70 years.

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:12.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel himself may have heard

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah speak those words.

00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:15.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he certainly

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
saw it come true as he and his family
were exiled to Babylon.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about peace being interrupted!

00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:25.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was a young Judean prince taken

00:20:25.745 --> 00:20:27.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his homeland

00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:28.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and separated from his family.

00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:34.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
But being chosen to receive special training

00:20:34.754 --> 00:20:37.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar

00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:39.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
presented another set of challenges.

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:41.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
The entire way

00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:46.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Babylonian life was contrary
to what Daniel knew growing up in Judah.

00:20:46.015 --> 00:20:49.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Daniel was determined
not to pollute himself

00:20:49.102 --> 00:20:51.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
with foods Jehovah would not approve of.

00:20:54.607 --> 00:20:56.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah blessed

00:20:56.442 --> 00:20:57.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel’s determination to be faithful,

00:20:57.902 --> 00:20:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he was selected to serve

00:20:59.695 --> 00:21:02.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of King Nebuchadnezzar’s wise men.

00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:12.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar was a warrior-king

00:21:12.834 --> 00:21:15.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
intent on building a great empire.

00:21:15.878 --> 00:21:17.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
After he officially

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
took the throne
in 624 B.C.E., his domain

00:21:21.134 --> 00:21:23.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
grew with each conquest.

00:21:23.177 --> 00:21:26.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babylon became an epicenter
of trade and commerce.

00:21:29.016 --> 00:21:30.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar undertook

00:21:30.893 --> 00:21:32.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
huge building projects throughout the city,

00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:35.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
which made the city seem impregnable.

00:21:36.774 --> 00:21:41.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the sense of security
the inhabitants of Babylon must have felt,

00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:43.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
locked safely behind the city’s walls.

00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:47.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar

00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:48.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
attributed the prosperity

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:50.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and security all around him

00:21:50.121 --> 00:21:52.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the power of his false gods.

00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:56.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The chief of these false gods
was Marduk, the god of war.

00:21:58.754 --> 00:22:03.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, these false gods and their priests
would prove to be worthless.

00:22:03.968 --> 00:22:06.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
One night,

00:22:06.012 --> 00:22:08.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Nebuchadnezzar had a strange dream.

00:22:17.982 --> 00:22:20.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Call the wise men!

00:22:21.861 --> 00:22:23.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:22:23.154 --> 00:22:24.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Relate the dream to your servants.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will tell the interpretation.

00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t make the dream known to me

00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:31.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the interpretation,

00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:32.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll be dismembered,

00:22:32.705 --> 00:22:35.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your houses will be turned into public latrines.

00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:38.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is not a man on earth

00:22:38.628 --> 00:22:40.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can do what the king demands.

00:22:40.087 --> 00:22:41.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
What the king is asking is difficult.

00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one exists

00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:45.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could tell this to the king except

00:22:45.384 --> 00:22:47.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
—except the gods.

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:54.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seize them!

00:22:55.978 --> 00:22:57.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kill them!

00:22:59.982 --> 00:23:00.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerah.

00:23:00.983 --> 00:23:02.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re in danger.

00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:02.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? What happened?

00:23:02.944 --> 00:23:03.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t hear everything,

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:05.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the wise men angered the king.

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:07.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone is to be executed by dawn.

00:23:07.865 --> 00:23:10.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bring Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah here.

00:23:10.993 --> 00:23:13.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll try to learn more.

00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:15.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
This edict to kill all the wise men

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:18.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
would also include Daniel and his companions.

00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:21.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s look at this
from Daniel’s perspective.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here he is, a young man in a foreign land,

00:23:23.756 --> 00:23:28.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving in the court of one
of the most powerful and violent men alive.

00:23:28.427 --> 00:23:30.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that man is now demanding

00:23:30.888 --> 00:23:33.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
that someone, in effect, read his mind:

00:23:33.683 --> 00:23:35.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Tell me my dream,

00:23:35.726 --> 00:23:37.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tell me what it means.”

00:23:39.855 --> 00:23:41.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
O king,

00:23:41.524 --> 00:23:45.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:48.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:23:50.283 --> 00:23:51.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, where is your God?

00:23:51.867 --> 00:23:52.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where?

00:23:55.579 --> 00:24:00.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
I believe that he—
I know that he will reveal it to me.

00:24:00.584 --> 00:24:02.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, give me time.

00:24:05.464 --> 00:24:07.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel is not acting

00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:09.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
on previous experience.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t received interpretations
of dreams from Jehovah.

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:15.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he is acting on faith

00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:17.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
—faith that he had learned

00:24:17.768 --> 00:24:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
by studying the sacred books of his time.

00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:21.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
These books

00:24:21.814 --> 00:24:24.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely included the inspired writings

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:29.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and other prophets.

00:24:29.113 --> 00:24:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, we can only imagine

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel poring over these scrolls,

00:24:34.994 --> 00:24:37.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
opening up his heart to Jehovah,

00:24:37.163 --> 00:24:39.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
begging Jehovah to give him wisdom and understanding.

00:24:39.623 --> 00:24:41.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved it.

00:24:41.334 --> 00:24:43.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt that

00:24:43.127 --> 00:24:45.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Daniel studied these accounts,

00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:47.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
his faith was strengthened

00:24:47.715 --> 00:24:51.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his bond with Jehovah drew even closer.

00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:55.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though Daniel knew nothing
of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream,

00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was fully convinced

00:24:57.433 --> 00:24:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would reveal the dream

00:24:59.602 --> 00:25:01.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its interpretation

00:25:01.687 --> 00:25:04.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prove to be Daniel’s salvation.

00:25:05.524 --> 00:25:07.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we know exactly which accounts

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:10.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was able to draw from at this time?

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:12.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s impossible to say for a certainty,

00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:16.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know he had access to “the books.”

00:25:16.035 --> 00:25:18.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
He references the prophecies of Jeremiah.

00:25:18.913 --> 00:25:23.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel could see how Jehovah blessed
faithful, obedient men in the past.

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:25.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by asking Nebuchadnezzar for time,

00:25:26.462 --> 00:25:28.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t looking to buy himself

00:25:28.255 --> 00:25:29.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
another day of life;

00:25:29.965 --> 00:25:32.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was allowing Jehovah to reward his faith

00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:34.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
by revealing the dream to him.

00:25:37.223 --> 00:25:40.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel strikes a balance here.

00:25:40.309 --> 00:25:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although he is confident

00:25:42.311 --> 00:25:45.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will reveal the dream to him,

00:25:45.314 --> 00:25:49.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
he isn’t casual in the way
he handled the situation.

00:25:49.402 --> 00:25:52.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did what any God-fearing man

00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:54.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
would do here.

00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:57.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approached Jehovah in prayer.

00:25:57.076 --> 00:25:59.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah,

00:25:59.078 --> 00:26:02.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
surely you didn’t bring us here just to die.

00:26:02.123 --> 00:26:04.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will people say?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
We told them

00:26:06.335 --> 00:26:08.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are the God of the heavens,

00:26:08.546 --> 00:26:11.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
the only God who can reveal secrets.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, vindicate yourself.

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:58.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have found a man from the exiles of Judah

00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:00.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can make known

00:27:00.431 --> 00:27:01.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
the interpretation to the king.

00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:02.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know who he is.

00:27:04.685 --> 00:27:06.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you really make known to me

00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:07.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dream that I saw

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:09.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its interpretation?

00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:23.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a God in the heavens

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:25.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is a Revealer of secrets,

00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:30.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:31.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is to happen

00:27:31.504 --> 00:27:33.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the final part of the days.

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:38.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is your dream:

00:27:46.018 --> 00:27:48.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw an immense image.

00:27:56.612 --> 00:27:58.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
That image

00:27:58.155 --> 00:28:00.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
was standing in front of you.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
You yourself are the head of gold.

00:28:07.623 --> 00:28:10.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after you another kingdom will rise,

00:28:10.626 --> 00:28:12.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
inferior to you.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then another kingdom, a third one, of copper,

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:20.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will rule over the whole earth.

00:28:20.803 --> 00:28:23.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the fourth kingdom,

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will be strong like iron.

00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:30.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
The kingdom will be divided.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the toes of the feet

00:28:32.147 --> 00:28:35.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:38.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the kingdom will be partly strong

00:28:38.946 --> 00:28:40.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and partly fragile.

00:28:43.993 --> 00:28:46.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
This took a tremendous amount of faith

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and courage on the part of Daniel.

00:28:48.998 --> 00:28:51.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we may find our peace threatened,

00:28:51.792 --> 00:28:55.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
our very lives might be on the line.

00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:59.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that moment, we can turn
to Jehovah God in prayer,

00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:04.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
opening up our hearts,
confident that he will support us.

00:29:04.847 --> 00:29:07.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like both Daniel and Jonah,

00:29:07.182 --> 00:29:08.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been given an assignment

00:29:08.642 --> 00:29:09.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proclaim a message.

00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:13.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
This requires courage to speak out boldly

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
concerning Jehovah’s judgments

00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:18.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
against those who oppose his sovereignty.

00:29:18.152 --> 00:29:20.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of these prophets are excellent examples

00:29:20.904 --> 00:29:24.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah backing those who trust in him.

00:29:25.034 --> 00:29:29.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always be with us
as long as we have faith in him.

00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face situations that seem impossible,

00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:35.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
as in the case with Hezekiah,

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:37.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the ability to tap

00:29:37.296 --> 00:29:40.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the most powerful force there is!

00:29:41.383 --> 00:29:44.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this system comes to a close,

00:29:44.011 --> 00:29:46.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will find ourselves in situations

00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:50.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
that test our courage and threaten our peace.

00:29:50.476 --> 00:29:53.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will have to stand up
for pure worship

00:29:53.395 --> 00:29:57.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Josiah, and this will be unpopular.

00:29:57.107 --> 00:29:59.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah on our side,

00:29:59.401 --> 00:30:02.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can face those situations with confidence.

00:30:02.112 --> 00:30:03.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s all-powerful,

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:05.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s going to help us through it.

00:30:05.783 --> 00:30:08.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the interesting thing:

00:30:08.661 --> 00:30:12.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the prophecies that Daniel recorded

00:30:12.206 --> 00:30:16.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
applied not only to the future
of the Babylonian Empire

00:30:16.543 --> 00:30:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also outline world events

00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:23.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our day and beyond.

00:30:23.092 --> 00:30:27.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these events are being fulfilled

00:30:27.137 --> 00:30:29.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
right before our very eyes!

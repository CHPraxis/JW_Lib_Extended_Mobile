The Governing Body
has always felt a keen responsibility

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:07.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live up to Jesus’ command:

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Feed my lambs. . . .
Shepherd my little sheep.”

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s technology

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes the Governing Body feel like family.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did the worldwide brotherhood
in times past

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoy such a strong bond
with the Governing Body?

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:31.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to January of 1945.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:32.970 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Franz

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.097 line:10% position:50% align:center
set out on a tour of Latin America

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ended up
with conventions in North America.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took four months.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose was to visit

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
branches already established,

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
to organize new branches,

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to forward the movement

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Kingdom preaching work.

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:53.866 line:10% position:50% align:center
Service tours often combined

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
supervising operations at a branch,

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving talks at conventions,

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
dedicating new facilities,

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
overnight visits to remote missionary homes,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed by evening meetings
with a local congregation.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
All this was packed into a few days.

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:12.134 line:10% position:50% align:center
They provided instruction

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:13.344 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the field ministry,

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:14.511 line:10% position:50% align:center
how to conduct meetings,

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also on what was taking place
in the worldwide field.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they would take time

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go out into the field ministry with them.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
One such visit included
a stopover in Guatemala,

00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:28.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they visited a very small congregation

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:31.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
of just eight people.

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their heart was in the preaching work.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can speak from my own experience

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:39.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the missionaries
were very close to Brother Knorr’s heart.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:43.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after sending them first to Latin America,

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was eager to see their progress.

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he visited them.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, over the years,
he traveled the world

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he visited as many missionary homes

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:53.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he possibly could.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
He privately met each missionary personally

00:01:57.012 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk over their challenges,

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arrange
for better accommodations if needed,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assess the potential for growth,

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even to establish a new branch

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:08.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
or arrange to purchase new property

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
if needed.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr loved the brotherhood,

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:14.780 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially missionaries

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
and branch personnel.

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he would take the opportunity

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a 15- or 20-minute stopover

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a train station or an airport

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give encouragement

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to help them
to advance the preaching work.

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:34.174 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr had deep concern

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.176 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the welfare of the brothers

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the war-torn countries of Europe.

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.098 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Henschel

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled to Britain, France,

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Switzerland, Belgium,

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Netherlands, and Scandinavia

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
in November 1945.

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine, just a few months

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
after World War II ended,

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
the railroad track was destroyed
and bridges were destroyed.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were no good connections

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:02.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the cities.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not tourist travel;

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was really hard work.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:12.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even this they did

00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:14.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of loving the brothers

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helping and encouraging

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:19.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers in these countries.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:27.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
After visiting the friends
in war-torn Europe,

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Brothers Knorr and Henschel embarked

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a very ambitious and extensive

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
47,000-mile (76,000 km) tour.

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:36.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
They visited some lands

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there were few or even no Witnesses.

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
If no branch operated
in a country they visited,

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
they connected with the local congregations

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
in private homes,

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
they attended their meetings,

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they accompanied the local publishers

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the homes of interested ones
for group meetings.

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:55.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they often rented venues
for public meetings.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:59.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Henschel
went on the streets to advertise the talk

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
that evening.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Brother Knorr himself
even rode with bicycle parades

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
to advertise his talks.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:09.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these meetings attracted
hundreds of interested ones,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though in one city,

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a threatening note
that was received.

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:19.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, things don’t always turn out
as planned.

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:23.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a service tour of countries in Africa.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those was Nigeria,

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were to give talks
at two conventions.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those conventions
was 400 miles (640 km) away

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and involved a road trip.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they got off to an early start
at 3:30 in the morning.

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
On into the trip,
they started to have car problems.

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:42.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those car problems
turned into a grueling 18-hour delay,

00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:45.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they realized
they weren’t going to make the convention.

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:48.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they decided
to go back to the branch in Lagos.

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the return trip took 24 hours

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
through jungle roads
and additional car problems.

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:56.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got back to the branch,

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:58.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
they took a very brief rest,

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:01.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were on to the next branch.

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:03.240 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr loved the brothers,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he enjoyed being with them.

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:06.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember very well

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
how after his concluding talk,

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:11.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
he waved to the brothers

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we in the audience took out handkerchiefs

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:17.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waved back for many minutes.

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:19.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that was not all.

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:22.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and Brother Henschel
then went to the railroad station

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:26.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say farewell to the brothers
leaving in special trains.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:30.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
They called out
<i>“Auf Wiedersehen! Gute Reise!”</i>

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they stayed there
till 10:30 at night doing that.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
They thought not of their comfort,

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:39.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they thought of the brothers.

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:41.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
A request to hold a large special meeting

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:44.364 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Athens in 1952

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:47.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not granted by the authorities
because of religious interference.

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:52.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not wanting to miss an opportunity
to encourage the Greek brothers,

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:55.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr came up with an alternate plan.

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:58.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and Brother Henschel would take taxis

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:00.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the homes of local brothers,

00:06:00.088 --> 00:06:03.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they would give a talk
for approximately 20 minutes.

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they would go on to another home,

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they risked arrest
because of meeting together.

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:13.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were able to meet
with 905 of our Greek brothers.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
In describing that day, Brother Knorr wrote,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was one of the most blessed experiences

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our lives.”

00:06:22.027 --> 00:06:23.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz visited Spain many times,

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:24.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
but during the 1950’s,

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:26.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
our work was under ban.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz wanted to encourage
the local brothers,

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:32.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was especially concerned
for their safety.

00:06:32.037 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
On this one event,

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:36.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz and his driver
decided to park their car

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
near the home of their host,

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
a certain Brother Garcia, who was a mechanic.

00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:43.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with the hood of the car open,

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:46.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
they asked a neighbor,
“Is there a mechanic in the area?”

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:50.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, he was referred to Brother Garcia.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:52.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Garcia
then looked at the car and said,

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your car needs to come into my shop.”

00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:56.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the opportunity

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Brother Franz to meet
some local brothers and sisters.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was time to walk
to the meeting later that day,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz decided to wear the beret

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a sheepskin coat typical for the area

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he would safely blend in
with his brothers.

00:07:10.492 --> 00:07:11.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, these brothers were

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:14.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
very loving and courageous men.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:15.914 line:10% position:50% align:center
They worked very hard

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:19.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep the brothers
in countries under ban fired up with zeal,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
even risking their own safety.

00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:24.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz actually was arrested

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
while meeting with the brothers

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:30.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these schedules that they kept

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
must have been exhausting.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a country under ban was on the itinerary,

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:38.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might pay a visit
to government officials

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:41.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote legalization of our work.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr visited all of the branches

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:47.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage the brothers,
and he talked with the missionaries.

00:07:47.821 --> 00:07:50.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the 1950’s, there was much growth,

00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:53.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that proved to be too much for him alone.

00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:56.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he decided that it would be appropriate

00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to train some of us brothers

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could assist in that work

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see that the shepherding was done

00:08:05.213 --> 00:08:07.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the work in the branches

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:09.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
was done in unity.

00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:14.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the service tour of Africa in 1963,

00:08:14.014 --> 00:08:16.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Henschel attended the convention

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:18.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Gbarnga, Liberia.

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:22.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, soldiers invaded the convention.

00:08:22.147 --> 00:08:24.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
They arrested Brother Henschel and others.

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:26.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was mistreated

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:29.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
—beaten with a rifle butt to the point

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:31.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he thought he was going to die.

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he remained on the scene to encourage

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assist the brothers to be faithful,

00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:41.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
to avoid compromise.

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:44.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when finally he was released,

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:46.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of going home,

00:08:46.004 --> 00:08:48.006 line:10% position:50% align:center
he completed his assignment

00:08:48.006 --> 00:08:50.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
to visit other branches

00:08:50.092 --> 00:08:51.802 line:10% position:50% align:center
and upon return

00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:55.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
never acted the part of a hero or martyr.

00:08:55.722 --> 00:08:59.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just the cost
of doing the Lord’s business.

00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:02.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the headquarters representatives

00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:03.355 line:10% position:50% align:center
wanted the best

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:05.607 line:10% position:50% align:center
for delegates to a convention.

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:07.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Henschel were known

00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:09.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
to personally inspect venues

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:11.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even negotiate contracts.

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:13.865 line:10% position:50% align:center
In more recent times,

00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:16.701 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Jaracz personally visited hotels

00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:18.787 line:10% position:50% align:center
to make sure that there was a proper standard

00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:20.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
of comfort and cleanliness.

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:22.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even tested out the beds.

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.545 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr was well-aware of the situation

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:27.754 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the brothers were facing

00:09:27.754 --> 00:09:29.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Soviet Union.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote many letters

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:34.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which he called on the brothers
to live in harmony

00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:36.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction of the organization.

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:41.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
One such letter
fell into the hands of the KGB.

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:43.728 line:10% position:50% align:center
They altered it.

00:09:43.728 --> 00:09:45.730 line:10% position:50% align:center
But when Brother Knorr was told about it,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.732 line:10% position:50% align:center
he drew the brothers’ attention

00:09:47.732 --> 00:09:49.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the spirit of the letter

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
because from the spirit of the letter

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:53.488 line:10% position:50% align:center
it would be evident immediately

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:55.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
whether it was a letter from the organization

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:57.993 line:10% position:50% align:center
or a forged letter.

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:00.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is because the spirit
of the organization

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
serves to unite the brothers,
not divide them.

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
All this attention
to the international activity

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:10.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
was taking place
while simultaneously directing

00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:13.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work and expansion at world headquarters,

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:15.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
handling various legal issues,

00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:17.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
organizing and speaking at conventions

00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:19.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the United States,

00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:22.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead School lectures and graduations,

00:10:22.142 --> 00:10:24.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
annual meeting programs,

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:26.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the while taking care

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
of their own spiritual well-being

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:30.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that of their wife if married.

00:10:30.984 --> 00:10:34.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next few decades
would see even greater growth

00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:37.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also greater challenges.

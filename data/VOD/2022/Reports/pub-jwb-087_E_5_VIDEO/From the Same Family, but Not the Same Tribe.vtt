On September 18, 2020,

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Medicane Ianos,

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a rare Mediterranean cyclone, struck Greece

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and flooded a Roma settlement in Mavrika,

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just outside the city of Karditsa.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Local authorities worked
alongside emergency services to evacuate

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:27.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
over 1,000 Roma who lived there.

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:29.508 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But a family of seven

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:31.594 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who are studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.596 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were left behind.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:36.724 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was raining hard,

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:39.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the floodwaters were rising quickly.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:40.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I took my wife by the hand

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and carried my child on my back.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With great difficulty, we managed
to make it to a neighboring house.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were unable to contact the authorities.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were terrified
and had no option but to stay there.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know what to do.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:58.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were so scared and worried.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.205 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We had never experienced

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:01.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
anything like this before.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.585 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The floodwaters had risen a lot,

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:07.296 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we stood waiting for hours.

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.924 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I asked my father to pray for us.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did many times.

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were lots of people in the house,
both young and old.

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were afraid, and they were crying.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Video messages from the family
started to come through, asking for help.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could see their fear.

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to help them,

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was no way for us to go there
because access was impossible.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we could do was pray to Jehovah for them

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send messages of encouragement.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very distressed.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children were crying.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,
begging him for peace of mind.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I threw all of my burdens
and anxiety of my heart on Jehovah.

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, I felt calm and had no anxiety.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt his spirit giving me strength
during the hours that followed until dawn.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The situation was very difficult.

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had suffered a lot,

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.253 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their clothes were dirty.

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:30.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There was no way

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I could leave them there.

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were given a house to stay in.

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to calm down and sleep.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers gave us food.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:47.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah for teaching us
and taking care of us.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is our Savior.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I attended the first meeting
after the flood, I felt calm again.

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to keep my routine as normal:

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
study, meetings, preparing comments.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt joy and contentment.

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:11.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My legal documents, such as my ID,
were saved from the flood.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our neighbors were not prepared.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we, thanks to Jehovah’s direction,

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had packed emergency bags.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About a week later,
we were able to return to Mavrika.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The houses were in terrible condition,
full of mud.

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Disaster Relief Committee
helped us immediately.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers from 300 kilometers (190 mi) away
sent emergency supplies.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brotherhood showed us love in practice.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They worked hard
and helped us because they love us.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was deeply touched and found myself in awe.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are united.

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:54.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this brought
glory and praise to Jehovah.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we went there to help,
the Roma neighbors were very surprised.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked if we could help them too.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:06.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We replied that we have to help
our family first, our brothers.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were very puzzled
that we called our Roma brothers family

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since we were not from their tribe.

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:19.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 4:16 finds a good application
in this story.

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:22.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as every joint in the body offers help,

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:25.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so did the brothers.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:28.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all worked together

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide help to our brothers in need.

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is teaching me and helping me.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:38.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really trust in him.

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:41.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has blessed me personally.

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:44.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen how good he is to me.

00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a miserable world, Jehovah brings me joy.

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that he chooses
according to a person’s heart.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory belongs to Jehovah!

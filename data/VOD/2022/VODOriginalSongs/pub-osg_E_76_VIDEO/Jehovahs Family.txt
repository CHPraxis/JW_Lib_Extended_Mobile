00:00:18 In this world, it’s hard to find a friend—
00:00:25 Someone you can turn to who’s with you till the end.
00:00:32 I used to dream I’d find a people who could be
00:00:39 More than just some friends and more like family.
00:00:55 My search is over. I’ve come to know
00:01:02 I’ve finally found God’s people; I feel the love they show.
00:01:10 Now I live that dream that meant so much to me.
00:01:17 I found more than friends; I found Jehovah’s family.
00:01:26 Now I have brothers; I have sisters, mothers, fathers too,
00:01:36 Little boys and little girls, older brothers who
00:01:43 Come from ev’ry tribe and race and nationality.
00:01:52 We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.
00:02:02 We love each other; our bond is strong.
00:02:08 We love to have the honor of knowing we belong
00:02:16 To the greatest brotherhood we’ll ever see. We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.
00:02:49 Yes, we come from ev’ry race and nationality. We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.
00:03:08 Our God invites us to be more than a friend.
00:03:15 He wants us in his fam’ly; his love will never end.
00:03:23 Just to think that we will live eternally,
00:03:29 Then we’ll all be part of Jehovah’s family— A part of Jehovah’s family,
00:03:52 Family, Family.

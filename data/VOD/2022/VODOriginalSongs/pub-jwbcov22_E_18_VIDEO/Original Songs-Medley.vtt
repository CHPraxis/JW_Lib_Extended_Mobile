00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doubt and fear surround me—

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way ahead not clear.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through uncertainty you guide me;

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:36.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re always near.

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life may not be easy,

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this I know is true:

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:51.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re the God who’s ever loyal;

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:56.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life is safe with you.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me eyes of faith

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And help me always see

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:11.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are more with us than against us.

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courageous let me be.

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage, give me courage;

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:27.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
With courage, I’ll endure.

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:32.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me courage;

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your victory is sure.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feeling fear is human.

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my own strength, I’m frail.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:54.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have been my rock and refuge;

00:01:54.843 --> 00:02:00.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your power never fails.

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:04.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help me be courageous,

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let my heart be brave.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lasting harm can never hold me—

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:20.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
No prison, gate, or grave.

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:25.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me eyes of faith

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
And help me always see

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:35.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are more with us than against us.

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:40.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courageous let me be.

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:45.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage, give me courage;

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
With courage, I’ll endure.

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me courage;

00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your victory is sure.

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look around us now;

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
See the love on each face—

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out there in the world, hard to find.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these faithful friends

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the love they all show,

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Glad to leave that old world behind.

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love never fails; that’s promised.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
It always will endure.

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:59.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:04.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Jehovah gives.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he is.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:18.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we need to live.

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:21.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the love here today,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:30.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our heart may it stay—

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Jehovah gives.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he is.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:49.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:54.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we need to live.

00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:58.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the love here today,

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:05.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our heart may it stay—

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love,

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love,

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:24.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should I fear the lion?

00:05:35.355 --> 00:05:41.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should I fear any foe?

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:45.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah by my side,

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not run and hide.

00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:54.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
My God is with me; this I know.

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:12.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:16.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Determined to go on,

00:06:16.563 --> 00:06:22.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:26.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith.

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:44.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see the wondrous future

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:50.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has in store for me.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:53.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to be strong.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:56.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know it won’t be long

00:06:56.937 --> 00:07:03.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Till Jehovah claims his victory.

00:07:03.277 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:10.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

00:07:10.242 --> 00:07:12.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:17.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:21.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:25.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Determined to go on,

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:39.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:56.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith.

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:07.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stars that fill the summer night

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:10.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look down from above.

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:14.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beauty of the day and night

00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:17.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
You fashioned with love.

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:21.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your hands prepared the land and sea,

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ev’rything that came to be

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:29.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brought joy to your heart.

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:34.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is joy in your creation,

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the message of salvation,

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:45.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Paradise to come.

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:48.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to have your love forever

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is a real and lasting treasure.

00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:59.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
You alone will prove to be

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:03.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our joy eternally.

00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
This joy could not be ours

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:21.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the gift of your Son.

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:24.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
His sacrifice has paid the price

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:31.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
So joy could be ours for all time.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:34.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is joy in your creation,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the message of salvation,

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Paradise to come.

00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:48.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to have your love forever

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is a real and lasting treasure.

00:09:52.237 --> 00:09:59.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
You alone will prove to be

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:04.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our joy eternally.

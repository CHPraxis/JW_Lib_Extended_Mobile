00:00:13 Like an island of calm In dark stormy seas,
00:00:20 God’s people are living in peace.
00:00:26 With our eyes of faith, We see beyond the clouds
00:00:33 And know that the storm soon will cease.
00:00:39 To the ends of the earth, There’ll be peace at last
00:00:46 For all eternity.
00:00:52 From the valleys below To the mountaintops,
00:00:59 All creation will see Peace at last.
00:01:12 When the new world is here, All will be one
00:01:19 On earth and in heaven above.
00:01:25 And the peace we’ll know We’ve never known before—
00:01:32 A world ruled by justice and love.
00:01:38 To the ends of the earth, There’ll be peace at last
00:01:45 For all eternity.
00:01:51 From the valleys below To the mountaintops,
00:01:58 All creation will see Peace at last.
00:02:23 To the ends of the earth, There’ll be peace at last
00:02:30 For all eternity.
00:02:36 From the valleys below To the mountaintops,
00:02:43 All creation will see.
00:02:48 To the ends of the earth, There’ll be peace at last
00:02:56 For all eternity.
00:03:01 From the valleys below To the mountaintops,
00:03:09 All creation will see Peace at last,
00:03:20 Peace at last!

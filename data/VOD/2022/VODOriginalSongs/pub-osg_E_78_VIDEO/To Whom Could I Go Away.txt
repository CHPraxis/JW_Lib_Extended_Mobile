00:00:23 I have listened to Jesus In these troublesome days.
00:00:29 He lights up my path As I hear and obey.
00:00:34 He is the Fine Shepherd, And he shows me the way.
00:00:40 He guides ev’ry step, Never leads me astray.
00:00:49 Why should I ever listen To voices in opposition,
00:01:01 Those who would make me stray From the path I’m on today?
00:01:14 To whom could I go away?
00:01:21 Where could I turn in times of trouble?
00:01:27 To whom could I go away?
00:01:32 The voice of the stranger Leads only to danger.
00:01:38 It’s Jesus’ words I hear and obey.
00:02:01 I’m secure and contented With my place in his care,
00:02:07 Surrounded by love In the faith that we share.
00:02:13 I look to the future That Jehovah provides.
00:02:19 His Son is my Savior With sayings of life.
00:02:27 I will never listen To voices in opposition.
00:02:39 Why would I ever stray From the path I’m on today?
00:02:53 To whom could I go away?
00:03:00 Where could I turn in times of trouble?
00:03:05 To whom could I go away?
00:03:10 The voice of the stranger Leads only to danger.
00:03:16 It’s Jesus’ words I hear and obey.
00:03:28 To whom could I go away?
00:03:34 Where could I turn in times of trouble?
00:03:40 To whom could I go away?
00:03:45 The voice of the stranger Leads only to danger.
00:03:51 It’s Jesus’ words I hear and obey.
00:04:02 To whom could I go away?
00:04:09 Never, never ever will I stray.

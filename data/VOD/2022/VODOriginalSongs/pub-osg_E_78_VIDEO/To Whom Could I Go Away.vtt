I have listened to Jesus
In these troublesome days.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lights up my path
As I hear and obey.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the Fine Shepherd,
And he shows me the way.

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:48.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
He guides ev’ry step,
Never leads me astray.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:01:01.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should I ever listen
To voices in opposition,

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who would make me stray
From the path I’m on today?

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where could I turn
in times of trouble?

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:38.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
The voice of the stranger
Leads only to danger.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jesus’ words I hear
and obey.

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m secure and contented
With my place in his care,

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surrounded by love
In the faith that we share.

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:19.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look to the future
That Jehovah provides.

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
His Son is my Savior
With sayings of life.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will never listen
To voices in opposition.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would I ever stray
From the path I’m on today?

00:02:53.152 --> 00:03:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center

could I go away?

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where could I turn
in times of trouble?

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:10.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:16.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
The voice of the stranger
Leads only to danger.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:26.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jesus’ words I hear
and obey.

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:34.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90% position:50% align:center

I hear and obey.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never, never ever will I stray.

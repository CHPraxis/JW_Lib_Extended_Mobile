My husband contracted COVID-19.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was brought to the ICU,

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:10.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and two days later, he passed away.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t able to say goodbye.

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.201 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t able to see each other.

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.536 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t able to have our

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.121 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
last conversation.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I got sick

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:24.962 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the month of March 2020,

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:29.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then my husband fell asleep in death.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isolation can make you depressed.

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say that was
the worst time of my life.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband contracted COVID,

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.150 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and he was breathing heavily.

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I called 911.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ambulance took him,

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:58.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the way to the hospital,
his heart stopped.

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:03.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My bank account was blocked,

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:05.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had debts,

00:01:06.212 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had COVID,

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:11.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the landlord gave me
a week to leave the house.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband used to do everything,
and now it’s

00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my responsibility to be
the spiritual head of the family.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed help.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:26.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders helped me prepare
for our family worship.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s exactly what we needed at that moment.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:34.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times I felt dejected

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weak.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters really helped me

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing personal interest.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:47.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, not a day went by
without them calling me.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was feeling tired, without strength.

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt helpless.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the friends took care

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:57.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the entire move,
helped to clean the house,

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped me out financially.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like my arms and legs.

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:05.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They supported me.

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like my spiritual family
was carrying me in their arms.

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:12.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything that my brothers and sisters

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did for me during that difficult time

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:19.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the messages, the postcards, the flowers—

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that shows me the kind of family that I have.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what the kids really needed to see

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:30.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we were not alone,
that our friends were there, even though 

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:32.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they couldn’t be here physically with us.

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers have encouraged me

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many ways,

00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:43.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from letters from pioneers

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread all over Italy

00:02:47.272 --> 00:02:51.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to video calls, phone calls, and messages.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:57.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there will always be someone

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:01.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who Jehovah uses to comfort me.

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:03.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before, I felt weak and powerless.

00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:05.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave me strength;

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped me by means of the brothers.

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:13.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day after my husband died, I was

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:17.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so surprised when I opened the door
and our friends started singing for us.

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:38.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, I realized,

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:40.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We’re not going to be alone.

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:42.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have our spiritual family.’

00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:46.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to speak to Jehovah more intensely.

00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:50.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before, I would talk to my husband

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about everything.

00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I share my problems

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anxieties with Jehovah.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been keeping a little journal

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:04.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everything that Jehovah has done for us,
and I write it down

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:08.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I want to be able to tell my husband
when I see him again.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel alone at any time.

00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:11.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I felt that I belonged to a family

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.943 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that was caring for me and supporting me.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really saw Jehovah’s love

00:04:19.614 --> 00:04:21.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the help he gives.

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:26.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can do anything
to help you feel better

00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:28.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you are going through trials.

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:31.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing Jehovah’s support for me
by means of the brothers

00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:34.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes me feel secure when thinking about how

00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:36.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will support me in the future.

00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:39.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say that in the future,

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am absolutely certain

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will be with me.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no pandemic

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s no bad situation

00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:53.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will prevent Jehovah
from reaching anyone

00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they’re going through trials.

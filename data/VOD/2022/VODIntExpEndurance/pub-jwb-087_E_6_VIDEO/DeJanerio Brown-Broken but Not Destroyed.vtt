LaQuita worked
for the City of Virginia Beach.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the city, she was able to get a schedule

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that allowed her to focus on her ministry.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:31.927 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I came home on a Friday.

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:34.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both my mother and I had

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.348 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doctors’ appointments that day.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we came home and sat down,

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting ready to fix us a bite of lunch,

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got a phone call.

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:47.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a family member,

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were asking me
if I had seen the news.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I immediately

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tried to call my daughter’s phone,

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it went straight to voice mail.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said, “Well, let me try texting her.”

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I tried texting her,

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:08.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t get any response.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was about 10:00 or 10:30

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that night when we just finally
got the confirmation

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had indeed lost her in that shooting.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I will say,
that was the worst day of my life.

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting at seven o’clock in the morning,

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friends started pouring in,

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:42.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people in our home

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support us and encourage us

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:50.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from morning till night.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it meant so much.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped us to focus

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on something else at that time.

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:13.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love that they showed to us
—it was just astounding.

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just so amazing.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what helped us to get through,

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get through it all

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was our family, our spiritual family.

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The City of Virginia Beach, they volunteered

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take care of all
of the victims’ arrangements.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the amount of people,

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:48.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the venue that they decided upon

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the opera house in Norfolk.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers, they got everything together.

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city didn’t really have to do anything;
they just gave us the venue.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what really impressed them,

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the city, was that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the whole memorial, everything,

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took place within an hour.

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city officials were there in attendance.

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had the local newspapers

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who covered it, reporters.

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:21.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reporters

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:25.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were persistent in wanting to talk,

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:29.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so actually two of my brothers,

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they handled all of that information,

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the guidance
from those two brothers who came down.

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It kept us from having
to even worry about that, you know, 

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:43.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it was very helpful.

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I continue to get cards;

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:48.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get texts from people,

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just encourages me.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 41:10

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that has become my favorite scripture.

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:06.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going through this,

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could really feel Jehovah’s hand.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if he was rubbing my shoulders

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:20.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying: ‘It’s going to be all right.

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’ll be all right.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to get you through this.’

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:25.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has.

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day he gets me through this.

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:34.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it can happen to someone else,
it can happen to me.

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this instance, it did.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps me to keep a perspective,

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I reflect on how Jehovah

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:49.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to reverse it.

00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my biggest hope

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see Jehovah reverse

00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the damage that has been done.

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:01.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s promised it, and my faith

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the fulfillment of his promises.

00:05:05.492 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I look forward to being reunited
with my daughter.

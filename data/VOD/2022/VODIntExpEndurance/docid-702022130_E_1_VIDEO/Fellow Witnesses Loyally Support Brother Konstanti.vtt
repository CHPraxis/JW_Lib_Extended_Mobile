Konstantin Bazhenov is one of the first
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:09.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Russia to serve out a prison sentence
since the Supreme Court banned

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:11.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization’s activity in 2017.

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:16.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was released from a prison colony
on May 5, 2021.

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:18.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon release, he was immediately transferred

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:22.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a deportation holding center
and then deported to Ukraine.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was deported
because Russia had annulled his

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
citizenship as a consequence
of his criminal prosecution.

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:33.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Criminal charges were first initiated
against Konstantin

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:36.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Russian officers raided seven homes
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:39.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
including his, on June 12, 2018.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:42.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, he was charged with extremism.

00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:44.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, Konstantin and five of his 

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:48.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
fellow worshippers were sent
to a pretrial detention center.

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:50.579 line:10% position:50% align:center
The FSB, the investigator,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.123 line:10% position:50% align:center
and other operatives

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:54.125 line:10% position:50% align:center
promised me that if I pleaded guilty

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began cooperating with them,

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would guarantee me a suspended sentence

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would not go to prison.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Konstantin refused to cooperate
with the authorities,

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
which would have meant
compromising his faith.

00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:09.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
In total, Konstantin spent almost a year

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:13.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
in pretrial detention followed
by several months of restrictions

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
of certain activities
while awaiting the court sentence.

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:19.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was accused of organizing the activity

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:21.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an extremist organization.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
The main accusation was based on the fact

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:29.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we held a religious meeting
in the winter, in January 2018.

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
People there read the Bible,
sang spiritual songs,

00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:36.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
discussed how to live by Bible principles.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
The investigator interpreted
this religious meeting

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a meeting of a legal entity
that was banned in Russia.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:47.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 19, 2019,

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:50.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge announced the verdict:
three and a half years

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a general regime prison colony.

00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:56.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three months later, the Court of Appeal
upheld the sentence,

00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on February 4, 2020,

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Konstantin was sent to the prison colony.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:08.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
On February 8, 2020, I was taken
to the colony, to Correctional Colony 3,

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:11.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Dimitrovgrad,
Ulyanovsk Region.

00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worked in the colony store.

00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:16.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received a lot of letters in prison.

00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
An officer summoned me
and said to me: “Bazhenov,

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:23.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we receive 300 letters
for the whole colony in a year,

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but you alone have received
over 300 letters in a month!

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:29.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who do you think you are?

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:32.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want our inspector
to drown in these letters?”

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:34.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I explained that people want

00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:38.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support me, encourage me,
and comfort me in some way.

00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:40.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Konstantin spent a year and three months

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:43.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a prison colony
and was granted early conditional release

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:46.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
on May 5, 2021.

00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:48.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a happy moment.

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw Irina, my wife, and we hugged.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
The head of the prison division said:

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Kostya, I didn’t expect so many people!

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:58.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I knew you had brothers and sisters

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that letters were being written to you.

00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it still amazes me that so many people
would come to meet you.”

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:07.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
He concluded, “You must be a happy person!”

00:03:07.198 --> 00:03:09.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the day arrived for him to be deported,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Konstantin received further support

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:13.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his fellow believers.

00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:15.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the 19th of May, we arrived at the border.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:19.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
They checked my documents
and issued everything.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
My brothers and sisters were there
to meet me with a poster and flowers,

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:25.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my dear wife, Irina, was there.

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:28.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such an unforgettable moment

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:31.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we saw and hugged each other.

00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:33.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Jehovah promised

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide a way out of trials,
so he did for me.

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:39.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, he pushed all the barriers

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:43.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
aside and made it happen
so that my wife and I were able

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reunite on our wedding anniversary!

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:48.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brought us immeasurable joy.

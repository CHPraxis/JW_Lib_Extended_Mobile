00:00:01 Konstantin Bazhenov is one of the first of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:04 in Russia to serve out a prison sentence since the Supreme Court banned
00:00:09 the organization’s activity in 2017.
00:00:11 He was released from a prison colony on May 5, 2021.
00:00:16 Upon release, he was immediately transferred
00:00:18 to a deportation holding center and then deported to Ukraine.
00:00:22 He was deported because Russia had annulled his
00:00:25 citizenship as a consequence of his criminal prosecution.
00:00:29 Criminal charges were first initiated against Konstantin
00:00:33 after Russian officers raided seven homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:36 including his, on June 12, 2018.
00:00:39 After that, he was charged with extremism.
00:00:43 Eventually, Konstantin and five of his
00:00:44 fellow worshippers were sent to a pretrial detention center.
00:00:48 The FSB, the investigator,
00:00:50 and other operatives
00:00:52 promised me that if I pleaded guilty
00:00:54 and began cooperating with them,
00:00:56 they would guarantee me a suspended sentence
00:00:58 and I would not go to prison.
00:01:00 Konstantin refused to cooperate with the authorities,
00:01:04 which would have meant compromising his faith.
00:01:06 In total, Konstantin spent almost a year
00:01:09 in pretrial detention followed by several months of restrictions
00:01:13 of certain activities while awaiting the court sentence.
00:01:16 He was accused of organizing the activity
00:01:19 of an extremist organization.
00:01:21 The main accusation was based on the fact
00:01:24 that we held a religious meeting in the winter, in January 2018.
00:01:29 People there read the Bible, sang spiritual songs,
00:01:32 discussed how to live by Bible principles.
00:01:36 The investigator interpreted this religious meeting
00:01:39 as a meeting of a legal entity that was banned in Russia.
00:01:43 On September 19, 2019,
00:01:47 the judge announced the verdict: three and a half years
00:01:50 in a general regime prison colony.
00:01:52 Three months later, the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence,
00:01:56 and on February 4, 2020,
00:01:58 Konstantin was sent to the prison colony.
00:02:03 On February 8, 2020, I was taken to the colony, to Correctional Colony 3,
00:02:08 in the city of Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Region.
00:02:11 I worked in the colony store.
00:02:14 I received a lot of letters in prison.
00:02:16 An officer summoned me and said to me: “Bazhenov,
00:02:19 “we receive 300 letters for the whole colony in a year,
00:02:23 “but you alone have received over 300 letters in a month!
00:02:27 “Who do you think you are?
00:02:29 Do you want our inspector to drown in these letters?”
00:02:32 Well, I explained that people want
00:02:34 to support me, encourage me, and comfort me in some way.
00:02:38 Konstantin spent a year and three months
00:02:40 in a prison colony and was granted early conditional release
00:02:43 on May 5, 2021.
00:02:46 It was a happy moment.
00:02:48 I saw Irina, my wife, and we hugged.
00:02:50 The head of the prison division said:
00:02:52 “Kostya, I didn’t expect so many people!
00:02:55 “I knew you had brothers and sisters
00:02:58 “and that letters were being written to you.
00:03:00 But it still amazes me that so many people would come to meet you.”
00:03:04 He concluded, “You must be a happy person!”
00:03:07 When the day arrived for him to be deported,
00:03:09 Konstantin received further support
00:03:11 from his fellow believers.
00:03:13 On the 19th of May, we arrived at the border.
00:03:15 They checked my documents and issued everything.
00:03:19 My brothers and sisters were there to meet me with a poster and flowers,
00:03:22 and my dear wife, Irina, was there.
00:03:26 It was such an unforgettable moment
00:03:28 when we saw and hugged each other.
00:03:31 Just as Jehovah promised
00:03:33 to provide a way out of trials, so he did for me.
00:03:37 Indeed, he pushed all the barriers
00:03:39 aside and made it happen so that my wife and I were able
00:03:43 to reunite on our wedding anniversary!
00:03:45 It brought us immeasurable joy.

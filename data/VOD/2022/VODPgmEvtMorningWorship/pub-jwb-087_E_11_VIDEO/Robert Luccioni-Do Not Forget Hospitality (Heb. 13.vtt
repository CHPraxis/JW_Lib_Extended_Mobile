00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:05.622 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our text today is discussing hospitality.

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
And as we know, hospitality includes

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.360 line:10% position:50% align:center
generously giving to others.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.662 line:10% position:50% align:center
But you may have noted that our comments

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:14.764 line:10% position:50% align:center
make a very profound statement.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that “hospitality is

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:21.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the finest antidotes to loneliness.”

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:25.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever been lonely, really lonely?

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loneliness can be quite painful.

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:32.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know, it’s possible to be lonely
even when we’re surrounded by people.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
One writer stated: “Solitude is pleasant.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loneliness is not.”

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another described loneliness
as “like being in the rain,

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sky holds nothing
but the promise of more clouds.”

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister described
the feeling of loneliness

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “slipping down a deep well.”

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:55.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
The further she slipped,
the darker things became.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:01:00.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us to deal with loneliness
before we sink too deep?

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us start climbing
back out of that well

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
or pushing those clouds out into the sky?

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:10.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as our text says, hospitality
—generosity, giving—

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:14.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is that?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider
three Scriptural principles

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to why that is the case,
and we’ll see why this is true.

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:25.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look first at Acts 20:35.

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:29.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together—Acts 20:35—

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see our first promise.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here it says:
“I have shown you in all things

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that by working hard in this way,
you must assist those who are weak

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:42.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and must keep in mind the words
of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said:

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There is more happiness in giving
than there is in receiving.’”

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our first point is very simply

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
that giving makes us happy.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the apostle Paul here is quoting Jesus.

00:01:55.331 --> 00:02:00.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you notice Jesus was not saying
that we give when we are happy

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we give because we are happy.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says that we are happy because we give.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s significant because that tells us
that even when we force ourselves to give,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we don’t feel like it,

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:15.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will experience happiness.

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:18.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Researchers today have confirmed
what Jesus knew all along.

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:23.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
They even state that giving
possibly releases endorphins in the brain

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help us with serenity
and with contentment.

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:31.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our first point is
that giving makes us happy.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:35.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a second promise, look at Hebrews 13:16.

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:16 says:

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:44.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, do not forget to do good

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to share what you have with others,

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:51.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:54.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our second point is that giving

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
puts us in a special relationship
with Jehovah.

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:02.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is well-pleased when we are
hospitable—when we give to others.

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that cause Him to do?

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we may think of Paul’s words
at Philippians 4:18, 19.

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:12.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
There the apostle Paul was commending
the Philippian congregation

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they generously helped him
—helped Paul.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:20.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Paul said in response
that ‘Jehovah would fully supply

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:23.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to their need.’

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
So giving puts us
in a special relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re precious to Jehovah, and he promises

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will fill all of our needs,
including our emotional needs.

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we may hear that, and we say:
“Well, now wait a minute.

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:40.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is true that when I give,
when I’m hospitable, I am happy for a time,

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:43.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but then later loneliness comes back again.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:46.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean that this scripture,
this principle, does not apply to me?”

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:47.343 --> 00:03:49.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think about what Jesus said

00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 6:25, 33.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember there, Jesus said:
‘Do not be anxious

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘about what we’re going to eat
or what we’re going to drink

00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah will give us
what we need when we need it.’

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we trust that statement.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do we take that to mean

00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:07.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we’re hungry
or we’re going through a difficult time

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah gives us something
—takes care of our needs—

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll never feel hungry again?

00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:14.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. Later that day and the next day,
we’re hungry again.

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:16.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jehovah will make sure

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:21.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have what we need when we need it.

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s the same with our emotional needs.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not say
that we will never feel lonely

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that we’ll never feel down or depressed,

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:32.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he assures us that if we give to others,
if we are hospitable,

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will make sure that we have what we need

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:38.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can be happy
and fulfilled in life.

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s our second promise.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Giving puts us in a special relationship
with Jehovah,

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will supply our needs.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:50.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a third one, let’s look at Luke 6:38

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:54.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 6:38.

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:57.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
This principle or this promise is
that Jehovah makes sure

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:01.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we always receive much more
than we give.

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:04.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 6:38 says: “Practice giving,

00:05:04.754 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and people will give to you.

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:08.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will pour into your laps
a fine measure,

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pressed down, shaken together,
and overflowing.

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:13.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For with the measure
that you are measuring out,

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:17.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will measure out to you in return.”

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:21.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah always makes sure
that we receive much more than we give.

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:23.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we believe that scripture.

00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all of us have hit points in our time
when we feel like we are just giving

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:31.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
—giving maybe to the congregation,
to the family, or to a situation in our life.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re giving, and we’re just
not getting anything back.

00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:36.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what then?

00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean the scripture is not true?

00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:39.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, no.
Jesus understood that would happen.

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the way it’s worded.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:43.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Practice giving,

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people will give to you”

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:49.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
—people, not necessarily the ones
that we’re giving to.

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:52.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, with the measure that you measure out,

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:56.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
they (people) will give to you in return.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:02.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jehovah promises
if we practice giving,

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:05.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we practice strengthening our brothers,
if we practice hospitality,

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:09.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will ensure
through one way or another

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:14.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we receive the blessings, the strength,
and the encouragement to continue.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, does this formula work?

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it does,
and we’ll tell you an experience.

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll tell you an experience of a sister
who we’ll call Lydia.

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:24.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Lydia was a single sister
and a regular pioneer.

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:28.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
And though she had her normal down days
as everybody does,

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:32.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lydia was known
as a generous and hospitable sister

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:34.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as she always had gatherings at her home.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would invite the whole
field service group to her home for breakfast

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we’d go out in service.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or she would do other outings
—special outings—for older ones.

00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:47.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then Lydia was diagnosed with cancer,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this hit her very, very hard.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she later had to have surgery.

00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:56.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Lydia sank
into a very, very deep depression,

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
such that the elders, the congregation,
even her friends wondered

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:03.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
if she would ever be able to pull out of it.

00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:07.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, finally, on one shepherding call,
two elders went to visit her

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:11.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they read with her Luke 6:38,
the scripture that we just considered.

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:14.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they reminded her of how generous,

00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:16.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
how hospitable, she used to be in the past

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how this brought her such happiness.

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she acknowledged it was true.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she said: “I just don’t want to be
around people anymore.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t be around people.”

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these two brothers challenged her
in a kind way

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:33.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prayerfully try to force herself to give

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
just for a few months
and see how things worked out.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to everybody’s surprise, she did.

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was like the clouds parted
and the old Lydia came back again.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was many years ago,

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:49.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Lydia still has her down days,
just like everybody does.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:53.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she is again a happy
and productive servant of Jehovah.

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, hospitality
—generosity, giving—

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:02.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
is one of the finest antidotes
to loneliness and depression.

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:07.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we give, Jehovah promises
that we will get back in return.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s a beautiful account
that reminds us

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:13.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we cannot “outgive” Jehovah.

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:17.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know this one
in 2 Chronicles chapter 25.

00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:20.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at that together
—2 Chronicles chapter 25,

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting there in verse 5.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is speaking about Amaziah the king.

00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s 25 years old, king of Judah,
and this is at a time

00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he’s facing a conflict
with the Edomites.

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 5 says that he gathers in Judah,

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he identifies “300,000 [skilled] warriors

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve in the army.”

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he feels that that’s not enough.

00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you look at verse 6,
and he goes out and he hires

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
100,000 soldiers from Israel

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for 100 silver talents.”

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:53.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in verse 7,
the “man of the true God” comes and says

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:58.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send the 100,000 soldiers of Israel back
because “Jehovah is not with Israel.”

00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:02.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go with the 300,000 you have,
and I’ll be with you.

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:06.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you look at the beginning of verse 9
—2 Chronicles 25:9—

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:10.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king says:
‘But what about the money I paid out?’

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was no small change.

00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:16.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Appendix B14
in the back of our Bible,

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
those 100 silver talents

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:23.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be worth about $1.5 million
in today’s money in silver.

00:09:23.512 --> 00:09:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the king put out a lot of money
to hire those soldiers.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the prophet just says to send them away.

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s the next words
that are so reassuring

00:09:31.354 --> 00:09:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the context
of what we’re talking about today.

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:37.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that verse 9,
the latter part of it, says:

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:40.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The man of the true God replied:

00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah has the means
to give you much more than that.’”

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry about it.

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:49.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has the means
to give you much more than that.

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:52.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot “outgive” Jehovah.

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the context of our discussion,

00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:59.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises that if we are hospitable,
if we are generous, if we are giving,

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be happy;

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:07.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
he guarantees that he’ll supply
all of our needs, even our emotional needs;

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will move others to give back to us

00:10:10.092 --> 00:10:12.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
much more than we ever could give.

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:16.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we be determined to practice giving,

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:19.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
practice hospitality,
and practice generosity.

00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:22.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every time we do, we will push the clouds

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
farther back into the sky

00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:27.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will always receive
much more than we give.

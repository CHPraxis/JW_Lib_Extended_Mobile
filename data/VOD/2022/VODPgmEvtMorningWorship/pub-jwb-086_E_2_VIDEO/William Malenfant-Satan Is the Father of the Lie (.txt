00:00:02 The Scriptures do not say specifically
00:00:06 that the Devil fathered any of the Nephilim.
00:00:10 But Jesus’ words at John 8:44 reveal the fact
00:00:14 that the Devil does indeed have children,
00:00:17 figuratively speaking.
00:00:20 He can’t create humans,
00:00:22 but he can influence people
00:00:25 to reflect his characteristics.
00:00:28 And that is what makes them his children.
00:00:33 Turn with me to John 8:44.
00:00:36 We’ll read the entire text of Jesus’ words.
00:00:41 Knowing that the religious leaders were out to kill him,
00:00:46 Jesus’ words point out who their father is.
00:00:50 At John 8:44, Jesus said:
00:00:54 “You are from your father the Devil,
00:00:58 “and you wish to do the desires of your father.
00:01:02 “That one was a murderer when he began,
00:01:05 “and he did not stand fast in the truth,
00:01:08 “because truth is not in him.
00:01:12 “When he speaks the lie,
00:01:14 “he speaks according to his own disposition,
00:01:18 because he is a liar and the father of the lie.”
00:01:23 So according to the text, at one time he was in the truth.
00:01:28 But he had free will,
00:01:30 and he toyed with wrong thinking
00:01:33 to such a degree that it eroded anything that was good,
00:01:36 and nothing good was left within him.
00:01:39 And he made himself into “the father of the lie”
00:01:43 —Satan the Devil.
00:01:46 Now, if we add Jesus’ words
00:01:48 with what John wrote at 1 John 3:10,
00:01:53 we can identify specific characteristics
00:01:57 of “the children of the Devil”
00:01:59 and “the children of [Jehovah] God.”
00:02:03 Let’s read that together at 1 John 3:10.
00:02:08 It states: “The children of God
00:02:11 “and the children of the Devil
00:02:13 “are evident by this fact:
00:02:17 “Whoever does not practice righteousness
00:02:20 “does not originate with God,
00:02:24 nor does the one who does not love his brother.”
00:02:29 We must “practice righteousness,” but it’s not self-righteousness.
00:02:34 We don’t establish what is righteous for ourselves.
00:02:37 It’s Jehovah’s righteousness.
00:02:39 Isn’t that what Jesus said at Matthew 6:33:
00:02:41 ‘Keep on seeking the Kingdom and his righteousness’?
00:02:45 The standards that Jehovah God has set for us
00:02:49 —that is what righteousness is.
00:02:51 And one of the points about being righteous and serving God
00:02:56 is that we are “no part of the world.”
00:02:59 And what’s interesting about that idea
00:03:01 is that there are many people in the world who think they are righteous.
00:03:05 They set their own standards.
00:03:08 There are people who believe they’re practicing righteousness
00:03:11 as they set about to bring about social justice
00:03:16 or remove injustices
00:03:18 in the political, the commercial, the economics of this world.
00:03:23 They want to see justice for all.
00:03:25 No more racial inequality
00:03:27 and so many other items they follow through on
00:03:30 to remove them from this world scene today.
00:03:34 And they feel that they truly are being righteous.
00:03:40 When it appears, though, that one injustice is removed,
00:03:45 and it only appears that way in many cases,
00:03:48 isn’t there always another one that comes up?
00:03:50 Aren’t there a multitude of injustices in this world?
00:03:55 It makes me think about a longtime faithful servant of Jehovah
00:03:58 who was approached by a group of men
00:04:01 who criticized Jehovah’s Witnesses because we don’t get involved
00:04:05 in working against the social injustices of this world.
00:04:11 Our brother, who was known for being straightforward and outspoken,
00:04:16 said that what these men were doing
00:04:19 in their fight against injustices in the world
00:04:22 was battling against spiderwebs.
00:04:26 Injustices were like spiderwebs, and they would fight and battle,
00:04:31 and they would demonstrate to bring down a spiderweb.
00:04:34 But another spiderweb was being woven, being spun,
00:04:39 or maybe the same one in many cases just came up again.
00:04:44 And it just continues on and on that way.
00:04:47 And then he looked at the men, and he said:
00:04:48 “But we are going to get
00:04:52 “the spider, Satan the Devil.
00:04:54 “You’re after the webs, what he produces.
00:04:57 “You’ve got to go to the source and see that the spider is eliminated.
00:05:01 “And it’s Jesus Christ who is going to abyss Satan the Devil,
00:05:06 “the spider who’s spinning all of these things to distract people
00:05:11 “from the real issue about God’s Kingdom
00:05:14 “and serving Jehovah wholeheartedly.
00:05:17 “That spider will be thrown into the abyss.
00:05:21 No more spiderwebs.”
00:05:24 Truly, the Devil’s lie to Eve
00:05:26 about becoming like God, knowing good and evil,
00:05:30 has had far-reaching consequences
00:05:32 that affect people more than ever right down to this day.
00:05:36 We see it —the world’s attitude.
00:05:40 They’re independent.
00:05:41 ‘You don’t need God.
00:05:42 ‘We don’t need to be guided by Scriptural principles—what the Bible says.
00:05:46 ‘You decide for yourself how you want to live.
00:05:49 ‘There are no moral standards.
00:05:51 You fix your own standards.’
00:05:53 Isn’t that precisely what Satan told Eve?
00:05:56 ‘You can be like God.
00:05:57 ‘You decide what’s good, what’s bad,
00:05:59 and what’s right for you and not right.’
00:06:02 And they feel so sophisticated and so wise.
00:06:06 ‘We can fix our problems.’
00:06:08 Oh, really?
00:06:09 We look at the world scene today.
00:06:11 Are they really fixing the problems?
00:06:13 What do we really see happening?
00:06:16 It’s out of control.
00:06:17 The entire world scene is out of control.
00:06:22 The world in its wisdom prefers the lie.
00:06:27 Even though they don’t recognize the liar,
00:06:30 they still prefer the lie
00:06:33 instead of recognizing their need for Jehovah God.
00:06:37 And the outcome for the world
00:06:39 is stated for us at Jeremiah 8:9:
00:06:43 “The wise have been put to shame.
00:06:45 “They have become terrified and [they] will be caught.
00:06:48 “Look! They have rejected the word of Jehovah,
00:06:52 and what wisdom do they have?”
00:06:55 But, you know, you might ask the question:
00:06:58 ‘Why?
00:06:59 ‘Why are people so determined to go their own way?
00:07:03 What’s wrong with their thinking?’
00:07:06 There are various reasons, but there is one that truly stands out.
00:07:10 And the apostle Paul spoke about it
00:07:12 at 2 Thessalonians 2:10.
00:07:15 And this is what Paul said in part.
00:07:18 He tells us that people will perish
00:07:21 “because they did not accept
00:07:24 “the love of the truth
00:07:27 in order that they might be saved.”
00:07:29 Yes, “the love of the truth.”
00:07:32 People really don’t love truth.
00:07:34 They want to make up their own truths, which are lies.
00:07:37 They’re not truths.
00:07:39 We must accept the love of the truth.
00:07:42 And it’s really quite wonderful that Jehovah has made the truth in such a way
00:07:46 that it appeals to our heart
00:07:49 as well as to our head.
00:07:51 Think about the time when Jesus taught the truth
00:07:54 to his disciples who were walking on their way to Emmaus.
00:07:57 Remember how they responded?
00:07:59 It’s at Luke 24:32.
00:08:03 They said: “Were not our hearts burning
00:08:06 “. . . as he was speaking to us on the road,
00:08:09 as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us.”
00:08:12 And I found a very interesting comment
00:08:16 in The Watchtower  on this verse.
00:08:19 It’s The Watchtower  of 1962, April 15, page 227.
00:08:24 This is what it said:
00:08:26 “Only when we have real love for the truth
00:08:30 will we go through the experience of burning hearts.”
00:08:35 Isn’t that fascinating?
00:08:38 Think about when your heart has burned
00:08:42 —when you’ve observed a drama,
00:08:44 when you’ve heard an encouraging talk,
00:08:48 when you sang a wonderful Kingdom song.
00:08:53 Think about the Hezekiah drama.
00:08:56 When we saw the angel spread his wings
00:09:00 while facing the Assyrian troops
00:09:03 and then devastation came,
00:09:05 didn’t your heart burn?
00:09:08 Or we think about when armed troops
00:09:10 were stealthily advancing on our brothers in an open field,
00:09:14 and then in the opened-up heavens
00:09:16 we see Jesus on a white horse with bow in hand
00:09:19 ready to take vengeance on those who hate Jehovah.
00:09:23 That’s a reality foretold in Scripture.
00:09:27 That fires the heart.
00:09:29 And there are other things that fire our heart
00:09:32 —when we hear beautiful songs that are meaningful,
00:09:35 such as “Never Alone”
00:09:38 and “Give Me Courage”
00:09:41 and many others.
00:09:43 The heart that loves Jehovah does indeed burn.
00:09:47 And this is not just emotion.
00:09:50 Our thinking ability and our emotions work together
00:09:53 and motivate us to know and to feel
00:09:56 the power of the truth.
00:09:58 As The Watchtower  I quoted from declares:
00:10:02 ‘Our life depends on whether we have love for the truth.’
00:10:07 So love Jehovah.
00:10:08 Love our neighbor.
00:10:10 And, yes, we must love the truth.

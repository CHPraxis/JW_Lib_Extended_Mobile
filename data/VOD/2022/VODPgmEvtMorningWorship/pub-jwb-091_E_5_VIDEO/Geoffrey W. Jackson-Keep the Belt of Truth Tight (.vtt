00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:04.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
This morning, we’re going
to discuss the thought

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.556 line:10% position:50% align:center
of keeping “the belt of truth”

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:09.659 line:10% position:50% align:center
tight around our waists.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.795 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, why is that so important?

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:13.797 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we see in the world today

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.700 line:10% position:50% align:center
there’s just no end to the misinformation,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lies, the falsehoods
that are being spread.

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:24.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in addition to that, as Jehovah’s people

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
we face all sorts
of verbal attacks, don’t we?

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
People accuse us of horrific things,

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this can be very discouraging.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:36.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s why we need to make sure

00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve got “the belt of truth”

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
firmly around our waist—tight.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we tighten it?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course,
there are many different ways

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can reassure ourselves of the truth.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this morning, I thought we might talk
about just one thing that may help us,

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is to go back to the basics.

00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
From time to time, think about this question,

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it that convinced me or my family

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:08.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is the truth?

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we meditate on that,

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can help to strengthen our resolve

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue in the truth.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this way, figuratively speaking,
it’s as if we tighten the belt.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all know, those of us who wear belts,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:26.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need a tight belt for it to be effective.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with that in mind,
if you ever visit me in my office,

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:32.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll notice that I have two things

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:35.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
that from time to time I’ll look at.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
One is this publication.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you look at it, you might say
the same as my wife did a few days ago:

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t you have
a better copy of that edition?

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not really looking so good.”

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:53.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why is this in my collection of books
in the office?

00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, because this is the book,
<i>“Let God Be True,”</i>

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my mother started studying in 1956

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she was contacted
in the door-to-door work.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I have a connection to this
because at that time I was 18 months old.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you can see in the front,

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:14.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had no potential whatsoever

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being in the Writing Department
or the Art Department.

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:19.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess it did prove
that at an early age,

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was interested in books.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:25.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyway, this book is close to my heart

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it helped my mother

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a time when she faced some opposition.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:33.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’d just started using this book

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a minister from the Methodist Church
and a missionary

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:40.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
came along to her house to try to force her

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stop studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what did they do?

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they berated the Witnesses.

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:50.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said all sorts of falsehoods.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:52.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they said everything they could

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was negative about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once they left, my mother said that she felt

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:01.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
very discouraged and disheartened

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:05.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
after being the victim of this verbal abuse.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:07.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did she do?

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
She took her King James Bible

00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:12.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and turned to a scripture

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she had just studied in paragraph 5

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this book in the first chapter.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’d like to read it with me,
if you would.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have an electronic device,

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have an advantage this morning
because I’d like you to turn

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:30.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the book of Isaiah 8:20.

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:35.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’d like you to read it
from the <i>King James Version.</i>

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:38.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Isaiah 8:20

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and if you tap on verse 20,

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:44.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see that the <i>King James Version </i>
may come up.

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “To the law and to the testimony:

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if they speak not according to this word,

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>it is </i> because <i>there is</i>  no light in them.”

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:57.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that touched her heart

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:02.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped her to make the decision
to continue studying.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you’re like me,
you are probably trying to work out:

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What is “the testimony”?
What’s this all about?’

00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:11.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you look at the revised text

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:14.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>  in verse 20,
it helps us, doesn’t it?

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
There, it says: “Instead,
they should inquire of the law

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of the written confirmation!

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they do not speak according
to this word, they have no light.”

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:32.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she realized that these two
who had come to visit her

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:35.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not show her anything
from the Scriptures.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:38.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, they just said what they felt

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that helped her because she realized,

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:46.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the <i>“Let God Be True”</i>  book
says in chapter 1,

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everything we believe about God

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs to be based
on the Word of God, the Bible

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in other words, written confirmation.

00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:02.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the first lesson—the first point
that is a good reminder to me personally.

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what people say about us,

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:09.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what negative comments are made,

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:12.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can always take comfort in the thought

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:17.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our beliefs are solidly based
on the Bible.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:22.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second thing
that you might notice in my office

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
is this <i>Watchtower</i>  magazine.

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:29.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s from February 15, 1955.

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:31.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if I’m not in my office
and you see it, you may think,

00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Ah, he’s got that there because he was born

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
just a couple of weeks after this.’

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that’s not the reason it’s there.

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:45.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reason is that this was the second thing
that helped my mother

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take a stand for the truth.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were two beautiful articles
in this <i>Watchtower.</i>

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one was entitled

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Only One Right Religion.”

00:05:57.373 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice how it starts off:

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:04.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you pay for wheat
will you settle for straw?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you buy wine will you accept water?

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:12.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or if you thirst for water
will you be satisfied with mud?

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:14.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What if someone came to prove

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you were being defrauded
in these ways?

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:22.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you be angry with him
or with the one who was cheating you?”

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great start to the article!

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:28.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it went on to show
how the truth of God’s Word

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being taught by Jehovah’s people today.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a second scripture

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was in this magazine
that really helped my mother.

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:41.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’d like, turn with me
to the book of Jeremiah

00:06:41.017 --> 00:06:44.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jeremiah chapter 23.

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the context of this,

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:50.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to read verses 28 and 29.

00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:54.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the previous verses,
it mentions false prophets

00:06:54.897 --> 00:06:59.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those who tell lies, who are dreaming,

00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who try to explain their dreams.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:06.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 27 says that these are
the same ones who teach people

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:10.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ‘intend to make them forget my name.’

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do verses 28 and 29 say?

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:18.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let the prophet who has a dream
relate the dream,

00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:22.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the one who has my word

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should speak my word truthfully.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:29.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What does the straw have in common
with the grain?’ declares Jehovah.”

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:34.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see how the <i>Watchtower</i>  article
was tied in there about grain and straw?

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the point is that we need
to speak God’s Word truthfully.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second article in this magazine,
which is equally good,

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:49.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps persons to see the need
to select the true religion;

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is “Choosing the One Right Religion.”

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this article, it raises the point
that sometimes people will say:

00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, I just don’t have time to investigate
all the religions in the world.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can I find the truth?

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.’

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this magazine,
building on what was said in Jeremiah, said,

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:18.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, if you go to a haystack
looking for a needle,

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:22.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
you don’t have to look
at every straw in the haystack.’

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:24.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, they recommend
quite a radical move,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Burn the haystack, and then with a magnet,
you can find the needle.’

00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:30.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as it goes on to say, you see,
as Jeremiah said,

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:36.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘God’s Word is like a fire.’

00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:40.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, in verse 29, it says
it’s like a fire that consumes the rubbish.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we don’t have to go around investigating

00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:46.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the various teachings
of different religions.

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:49.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be like a huge haystack.

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:51.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather, when we study the Bible

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we see the pure truth in the Scriptures,

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we can identify anything

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s virtually rubbish or straw.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have the real thing.

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:07.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, that helps to really convince us
that we have the truth.

00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:11.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if people don’t even know
Jehovah’s name,

00:09:11.234 --> 00:09:13.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would we believe them?

00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:17.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if they believe
that people are going to hellfire,

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would we believe everything that they say

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:23.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
—particularly if they’re criticizing
Jehovah’s people?

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what about you?

00:09:26.349 --> 00:09:29.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it that convinced you

00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you found the truth?

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s good from time to time
to think about that question.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:40.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my case, I think of those things
that my mother taught me.

00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one from the book of Isaiah:

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:47.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that what we believe
is based on the Bible.

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:50.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the second thing:
We don’t have to investigate

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
every story that’s told to us.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:55.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once we have the truth from the Bible,

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:59.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can recognize
what’s right and what’s wrong.

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:03.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we don’t need to listen
to the “father of the lie,”

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:06.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we certainly believe
in “the God of truth.”

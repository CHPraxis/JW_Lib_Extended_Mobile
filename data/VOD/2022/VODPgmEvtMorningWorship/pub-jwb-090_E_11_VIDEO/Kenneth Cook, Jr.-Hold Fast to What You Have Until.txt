00:00:01 Well, throughout his earthly ministry,
00:00:03 Jesus expressed and showed gratitude.
00:00:07 Let’s look at what we can learn
00:00:08 from what he said and what he did
00:00:11 as a thankful person.
00:00:13 First, Jesus’ heartfelt prayers of thanks
00:00:16 had an effect on others.
00:00:18 Consider what happened the day after Jesus
00:00:21 miraculously fed thousands
00:00:23 near Bethsaida along the Sea of Galilee.
00:00:27 At John 6:23, we read
00:00:29 that “boats from Tiberias . . . arrived near the place where they ate the bread
00:00:33 after the Lord had given thanks.”
00:00:37 That added comment, “after the Lord had given thanks,”
00:00:41 must be in there for a reason.
00:00:44 For one thing, this tells us that the boats arrived
00:00:48 not just near the place where a miracle had occurred the day before,
00:00:52 but it also tells us that the boats arrived near the place
00:00:56 where the Lord had given thanks.
00:00:59 That fact was recorded under inspiration many years later by the apostle John.
00:01:05 And this shows us that Jesus’ true disciples
00:01:08 saw and remembered more
00:01:11 than the miracle itself.
00:01:13 They also witnessed and remembered
00:01:15 Jesus’ heartfelt prayer of thanks.
00:01:19 No doubt Jesus’ disciples followed his good example.
00:01:24 Let’s look at two of the many fine qualities
00:01:27 that Christians who imitate Jesus’ good example display,
00:01:31 namely, courage and humility.
00:01:35 We begin with courage.
00:01:37 Jesus was moved by a deep sense of gratitude
00:01:40 to be courageous.
00:01:42 Why can we say this?
00:01:44 For one thing, because of something that he said
00:01:47 during a very critical time for him.
00:01:50 You’ll recall that in the garden of Gethsemane,
00:01:53 Jesus prayed out of great concern
00:01:56 over the reproach that his death
00:01:59 as one being charged with blasphemy and sedition
00:02:02 would bring to his heavenly Father.
00:02:05 In fact, Jesus implored Jehovah
00:02:07 that a death of this sort might pass away from him.
00:02:11 Yet, despite such intense feelings, he said:
00:02:14 “Not as I will, but as you will.”
00:02:18 What helped Jesus to make that courageous statement,
00:02:21 knowing what it would lead to?
00:02:24 We find the answer in Hebrews 12:2,
00:02:27 where it says in part of Jesus
00:02:30 that “for the joy that was set before him
00:02:33 he endured a torture stake, despising shame.”
00:02:39 So, what helped Jesus to accept God’s will for him?
00:02:43 “The joy that was set before him.”
00:02:45 That joy included his hope, yes,
00:02:48 but above all his privilege to honor Jehovah
00:02:52 by keeping his integrity.
00:02:55 No matter how much his enemies opposed him, mocked him,
00:02:59 or tried to heap shame on him and his heavenly Father,
00:03:03 Jesus put that out of his mind,
00:03:06 despising shame and finding joy.
00:03:10 “For the joy that was set before him” he gratefully and courageously
00:03:15 accepted the privilege of putting God’s will ahead of his own.
00:03:19 “Not as I will, but as you will,” he said.
00:03:24 Do God’s people today imitate Jesus’ grateful and courageous example?
00:03:29 Absolutely!
00:03:31 Jesus’ true followers today strive to do God’s will
00:03:34 despite threats of imprisonment, actual imprisonment,
00:03:38 torture, verbal abuse, loss of livelihood, and so forth.
00:03:43 And when our brothers are unjustly imprisoned,
00:03:47 we do all that we can for them,
00:03:49 including speaking up in their behalf
00:03:52 and, of course, praying for them.
00:03:55 Like Jesus, gratitude for the privilege
00:03:58 to know and worship Jehovah
00:04:00 and for the blessing of serving in this marvelous brotherhood that we have
00:04:04 should move us to have and show courage
00:04:07 in doing God’s will today.
00:04:10 And we allow gratitude, not shame,
00:04:14 to take root and grow within us.
00:04:17 The second quality that we want to look at is this:
00:04:20 Grateful Christians are humble people.
00:04:23 Again, we’ll consider Jesus’ example.
00:04:26 Every miracle that he performed
00:04:29 and every teaching that he passed on to his disciples
00:04:33 was carried out in humility.
00:04:36 Jesus never sought to draw attention to himself, did he?
00:04:40 Instead, what do we see?
00:04:42 We see that he was grateful for the privilege to serve others
00:04:46 and grateful for every positive response
00:04:49 that he saw in others.
00:04:51 And what he saw went beneath the surface.
00:04:55 With that in mind, think about what happened
00:04:58 during Jesus’ last evening with his faithful apostles
00:05:02 when their imperfections were on full display, you could say.
00:05:06 For instance, out of all of them,
00:05:08 only Jesus would wash the feet of the others.
00:05:12 Yet, despite this, Jesus saw what?
00:05:15 He saw the good in them,
00:05:17 and he was motivated to do something extraordinary for them.
00:05:22 Take note of what Jesus saw in them
00:05:24 as we read Luke chapter 22,
00:05:27 and verses 28 and 29,
00:05:30 where Jesus said this to them:
00:05:34 “However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials;
00:05:38 “and I make a covenant with you,
00:05:41 “just as my Father has made a covenant with me,
00:05:44 for a kingdom.”
00:05:46 What moved Jesus to do this for them?
00:05:50 Gratitude.
00:05:51 You see, Jesus saw the good in them —didn’t he?—and he remembered it.
00:05:56 “You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials,” he said.
00:06:00 What a wonderful gift he was offering to them
00:06:03 by inviting them to share in his Kingdom,
00:06:07 and what outstanding humility he displayed in doing this!
00:06:10 Jesus did not view himself as so great in his own eyes
00:06:15 that he could overlook the good that was in his disciples.
00:06:19 He was humble, he appreciated the good,
00:06:23 and he truly “loved them to the end.”
00:06:26 Do we likewise show humility and gratitude
00:06:29 though faced with the imperfections of our brothers?
00:06:33 We must remember that Jesus never overreacted
00:06:37 to the obvious faults of his disciples.
00:06:40 Instead, he was grateful for their support.
00:06:43 And he always looked for and found
00:06:46 —and found—the good in them.
00:06:49 We should want to do the same for one another
00:06:52 —all of us need it.
00:06:54 In fact, we need one another now more than ever, don’t we?
00:06:58 The gratitude that we feel for being in pure worship
00:07:02 should move us to seek the good in one another always.
00:07:06 Along with this, we should be moved to reach out
00:07:09 and encourage one another in any way that we can.
00:07:14 This includes giving sincere commendation that stems from gratitude.
00:07:19 As Jesus said: “You are the ones
00:07:22 who have stuck with me in my trials.”
00:07:25 He was commending them, acknowledging the good in them.
00:07:28 He was thankful for it.
00:07:30 We too should give sincere commendation
00:07:34 to others when appropriate and do it out of gratitude.
00:07:37 We really mean it from the heart.
00:07:40 So, what have we considered this morning?
00:07:43 We looked at how Jesus’ sincere prayers of thanks
00:07:46 were long remembered by his disciples.
00:07:49 In fact, his prayers were remembered as much as his miracles.
00:07:54 As another example, think of what we read at John 11:41,
00:07:58 where—when resurrecting Lazarus— Jesus offered a prayer
00:08:02 and started off by saying: “Father,
00:08:04 I thank you that you have heard me.”
00:08:07 That resurrection was astounding!
00:08:11 But Jesus’ prayer of thanks was also remembered.
00:08:16 We also reviewed how Christlike qualities, such as courage and humility,
00:08:20 grow out of a grateful heart.
00:08:23 And we considered ways in which we can show such qualities.
00:08:27 And Jehovah’s people are definitely doing this.
00:08:31 The numbers that we hear about of those now attending our meetings
00:08:35 are proof of the grateful spirit found in God’s people
00:08:40 and in those who see the wisdom of returning
00:08:44 while there’s still time.
00:08:47 We don’t yet know when this present world situation will end,
00:08:52 but we do know this: Jehovah’s purpose will not fail.
00:08:57 Jehovah and his Son will make certain
00:08:59 that all causes for harm disappear forever.
00:09:03 And aren’t we grateful for that?
00:09:06 Our job is this:
00:09:09 We need to make certain that we are ready to accept the opportunities
00:09:13 that may yet present themselves in doing Jehovah’s will
00:09:17 before the complete end arrives.
00:09:21 This includes giving everything we’ve got
00:09:23 to help others come over to Jehovah’s side.
00:09:27 The gratitude and humility and the courage
00:09:31 that result from a thankful spirit
00:09:33 will help us to do this.

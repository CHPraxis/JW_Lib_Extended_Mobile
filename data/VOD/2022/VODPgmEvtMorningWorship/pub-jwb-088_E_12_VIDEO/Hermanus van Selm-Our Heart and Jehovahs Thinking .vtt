00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:04.320 line:10% position:50% align:center
Two expressions

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.257 line:10% position:50% align:center
in today’s <i>Watchtower</i> comments

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:12.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
are “our heart” and “Jehovah’s thinking.”

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:15.231 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, based on these key expressions,

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
let us consider these questions:

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is our heart?

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
How deep should
Jehovah’s thoughts enter into it?

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what steps
can we take to absorb God’s thinking?

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is our heart?

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:35.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in the Bible, the word “heart”

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:38.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
is mentioned some 1,000 times.

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:41.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of that large number of occurrences,

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
only a few verses refer
to the literal heart.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
All other verses refer
to the figurative heart.

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:52.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is our figurative heart?

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our inner person.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it refer to our emotions?

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:01.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our emotions are part of our heart.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it refer
to our thinking abilities, our mind?

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the mind is part of it.

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:11.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it refer to our motivations?

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, motivations are part of it.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, how do these different parts

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
all relate to one another?

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to answer that,

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:28.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s compare our heart with a book.

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
A book is made up of several chapters.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, our heart is made up

00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
of several qualities and capabilities.

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just as all chapters
together form a book,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
so all qualities
of our inner person together

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
form our heart.

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:54.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how many chapters,
so to speak, are there in our heart?

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:57.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, numerous.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
They include not only our emotions,

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:03.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
motivations, and thoughts

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also our attitude,

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
desire, disposition,

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
goals, and other aspects.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:16.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as all chapters
together form the heart,

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:21.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
how many chapters,
so to speak, are there in our heart?

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our heart stands

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the qualities of the inner person

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make each of us

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:33.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unique individual that we are.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how deep
should Jehovah’s thoughts

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
enter into our heart?

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:42.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible answers that question

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of a comparison,
and we find that comparison

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 7:1, 3.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you would like to read along

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 7:1, 3.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will start in verse 1:

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My son, keep my sayings,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and treasure up my commandments.”

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the last part of verse 3 says:

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Write them on the tablet of your heart.”

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:15.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why did Solomon
use the word “tablet”

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:17.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
when speaking about the heart?

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, today when we hear
the word “tablet,”

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:21.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we think of ?

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, likely we think
of a handheld electronic device.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
But back in Bible times,
when the Israelites heard the phrase

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:32.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘write my commandments upon the tablet,’

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
it must have reminded them
of the two stone tablets

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
on which Jehovah
wrote the Ten Commandments.

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
And come to think of it, in a way,

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:45.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
those tablets were also handheld devices

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:47.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
but very heavy ones.

00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in Exodus chapter 24,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find the first mention
in the Bible of the word “tablets.”

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
There Jehovah told Moses

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He would write His commandments
on stone tablets.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at Exodus 32:16,

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:09.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible describes the method of writing

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had used:

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tablets were the workmanship of God,

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:17.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the writing was the writing

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:22.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God engraved on the tablets.”

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did the Israelites know

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:28.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the method of writing
that Jehovah had used?

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they knew that God’s laws

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
were not written on the surface
of the tablet with a piece of chalk.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that had been the case,
the laws could have been easily erased.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:44.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that God’s commandments
were engraved on stone tablets.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
They understood that the laws of God

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
were so deeply impressed into the tablets

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had become part of the stones.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could not be washed away or erased.

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were indelible.

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:01.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, why did Solomon

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
compare the heart with a tablet?

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
To teach an important truth
about the connection

00:05:07.924 --> 00:05:11.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Jehovah’s thoughts and our heart.

00:05:11.027 --> 00:05:13.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as God’s laws
were engraved in the tablets,

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:20.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
so God’s instructions should be engraved

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:23.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our heart—in our inner person.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should become
a permanent part of us.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what steps can we take

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ensure that our heart
absorbs God’s thinking?

00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:37.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the psalmist David helps us

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:42.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
to answer that question at Psalm 19:14.

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s read it together and note

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
with what activity David connects the heart.

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 19:14 says:

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the words of my mouth

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the meditation of my heart

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:59.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be pleasing to you, O Jehovah,

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
my Rock and my Redeemer.”

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this psalm
connects the heart with meditation.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:10.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, indeed,
when we meditate on God’s Word,

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
we let our heart absorb God’s thinking.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to meditate in the proper way.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What way is that?

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think of this comparison:

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:29.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying God’s Word
and taking time to meditate on it

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a bit like making a cup of tea.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
A cup of tea?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the connection?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to make a cup of tea,

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:42.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need a cup,

00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:44.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
water,

00:06:44.287 --> 00:06:46.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a tea bag.

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s compare the cup
with our outer person,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s compare the water in the cup

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:56.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our inner person, or our heart.

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we have the tea bag.

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:02.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this is not just a common,
average tea bag.

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:06.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this bag is filled
with the finest tea that can be found.

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:11.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
The contents of the bag
are not only tasty but also nutritious.

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
It even has health benefits.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s compare
this precious tea bag

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a Bible passage.

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:22.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we need to do first

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we put the tea bag in the water?

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we need to prepare the water

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it will have the right temperature,

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:36.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
or condition, to receive the tea bag.

00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:39.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, before reading the Bible,

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
first we need to prepare
our inner person

00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it will be in the right condition

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive God’s words and thoughts.

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:50.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prepare our heart

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:52.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we warm the water, so to speak—

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:55.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
by praying to Jehovah,

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking him to open our heart
to receive his words.

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:03.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, we are ready
to take the next step.

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
We put the tea bag in the water.

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, after prayer,

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are ready to take the next step.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
We start reading the Bible.

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:16.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what will we do next

00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:18.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the tea bag?

00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:21.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now comes the crucial question:

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long will we let
the tea bag steep in the water?

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we are in a hurry,

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may leave the tea bag
for a few seconds in the water,

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we move it a couple of times
up and down, and we pull it out.

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:37.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:41.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
We end up with a weak cup of tea.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:44.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, if we read the Bible hastily,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we think about what we read
just for a few seconds,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we hurry off
to do our daily activities,

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will be the result?

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:56.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not give our heart the time needed

00:08:56.852 --> 00:08:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
to absorb God’s thoughts.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we leave the tea bag

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:05.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
to steep much longer in the water,

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we allow the water to absorb the tea.

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:11.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tea becomes part of the water,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we end up with a strong cup of tea.

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:19.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, after carefully reading

00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:20.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Bible passage,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
we pause and take our time

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:25.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meditate on what we read.

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, we will give

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
our heart the opportunity

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
to absorb the precious truth

00:09:31.354 --> 00:09:33.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
from God’s Word.

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will be the result?

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s thoughts
will become an indelible part

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our heart.

00:09:41.764 --> 00:09:46.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in summary, what are the three points
that we considered?

00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, our heart
encompasses all the qualities

00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the inner person that make each of us

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unique individual that we are.

00:09:57.747 --> 00:10:00.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, Jehovah’s thoughts

00:10:00.383 --> 00:10:04.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
should enter so deep into our heart

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:07.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they become a permanent part of it.

00:10:07.423 --> 00:10:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, to absorb
Jehovah’s thoughts in our heart,

00:10:12.428 --> 00:10:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to meditate calmly

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what we read in God’s Word.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to meditation,
what is our goal?

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:27.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to be a strong cup of tea.

00:00:00 The Watchtower  comment for today
00:00:02 makes a very bold statement when it says:
00:00:06 “Satan uses movies and television shows
00:00:10 to spread his way of thinking.”
00:00:15 And so that thought alone should cause anyone that loves Jehovah
00:00:19 to think twice before turning on a television
00:00:23 or a monitor.
00:00:26 Concerning this method that Satan uses to spread his thinking,
00:00:30 the Watchtower  comment further says:
00:00:32 “He understands that storytelling
00:00:35 “does much more than entertain us;
00:00:38 it teaches us how to think, feel, and act.”
00:00:44 So when choosing our entertainment,
00:00:48 we need to remember that Satan’s storytelling
00:00:52 has had a detrimental effect
00:00:54 upon people for generations.
00:00:57 If you look at Isaiah 55:7,
00:01:05 the results can be seen.
00:01:09 It says: “Let the wicked man leave his way
00:01:12 and the evil man his thoughts.”
00:01:16 So the person that is taught by Satan
00:01:20 will have his thinking corrupted
00:01:22 and in time will end up
00:01:25 as an evil and wicked individual.
00:01:29 Now, verses 8 and 9
00:01:31 show us that imperfect thinking
00:01:34 is separate from Jehovah God’s thinking.
00:01:39 Now notice what it says at verse 8:
00:01:43 “‘For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
00:01:46 “and your ways are not my ways,’ declares Jehovah.
00:01:49 “‘For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
00:01:52 “‘so my ways are higher than your ways
00:01:55 and my thoughts than your thoughts.’”
00:01:59 So while the verse is talking about an evil and wicked individual,
00:02:03 somewhere along the way that individual was
00:02:06 an imperfect individual only.
00:02:10 So something happened to push them
00:02:12 into the evil and the wicked category.
00:02:15 Well, it was being taught by Satan the Devil.
00:02:18 That’s what happened.
00:02:20 So today, we’re all imperfect individuals.
00:02:23 So how can we maintain Jehovah’s thinking
00:02:27 so that we don’t get pushed into the category
00:02:30 of evil and wicked?
00:02:34 Well, it is a fact that Jehovah also uses storytelling
00:02:38 to help us to adapt our thinking to Jehovah’s thinking.
00:02:42 In fact, the Bible is filled with the experiences of individuals
00:02:46 —both good and bad.
00:02:48 The Bible gives us many illustrations and many stories that touch the heart
00:02:53 that help us to understand timeless principles
00:02:56 and Bible laws
00:02:58 that will help us in our decision process
00:03:01 so that our ways can become
00:03:04 like Jehovah’s ways.
00:03:06 Let’s take an example.
00:03:08 Now, throughout the Bible, it really highlights
00:03:11 Jehovah’s forgiving nature.
00:03:13 And let’s talk about that.
00:03:15 Let’s go to Exodus (first of all)
00:03:17 —Exodus chapter 34 and we’ll read verse 7.
00:03:22 Now, remember we’re being taught
00:03:24 Jehovah’s way of forgiveness.
00:03:26 So it says this:
00:03:29 “Showing loyal love to thousands,
00:03:32 pardoning error and transgression and sin.”
00:03:36 Well, that’s Jehovah’s forgiving nature.
00:03:40 And then if you turn to Isaiah 1:18,
00:03:45 notice how he paints a picture about this for us
00:03:49 —Isaiah 1:18.
00:03:55 He says: “‘Come, now,
00:03:57 “and let us set matters straight between us,’ says Jehovah.
00:04:01 “‘Though your sins are like scarlet,
00:04:04 “‘they will be made as white as snow;
00:04:07 “‘though they are as red as crimson cloth,
00:04:11 they will become like wool.’”
00:04:13 And so, there again, it’s identifying that this is Jehovah’s way.
00:04:18 Now, to touch our heart and really go to the core of the matter,
00:04:21 he has a story told.
00:04:24 And in fact, Jesus did that.
00:04:26 It’s found in Luke chapter 15
00:04:29 (about the prodigal, or the lost son),
00:04:32 chapter 15, verse 11.
00:04:34 Now, we’re not going to read it,
00:04:36 but I’ll start to tell the story in just a few sentences.
00:04:39 If you look at verse 11, there was ‘a man that had two sons.’
00:04:43 And in verse 12, the younger son took his inheritance.
00:04:48 In verse 13, “he traveled to a distant country
00:04:52 and . . . squandered” his inheritance.
00:04:55 And then, in verses 15 and 16, he became destitute.
00:04:58 In verse 17, ‘he finally came to his senses’
00:05:02 and returned to his father.
00:05:04 And verse 20 shows that “his father caught sight of him
00:05:08 “and was moved with pity,
00:05:10 and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him.”
00:05:16 Now, what are some of the lessons that Jehovah is teaching us
00:05:20 by means of this story?
00:05:23 Well, first of all, Jehovah yearns to extend forgiveness.
00:05:27 It’s his forgiving nature.
00:05:30 And just like that father,
00:05:33 we recognize that sinners may waste resources given to them.
00:05:39 We never lose hope that a sinner will return,
00:05:44 and we’ll give a warm reception
00:05:46 when they do return to Jehovah God.
00:05:49 Sinners can be restored completely
00:05:51 and regain a place in the family of Jehovah.
00:05:55 And finally, we learn that sinners may have to hit rock bottom
00:06:00 before they return to their senses.
00:06:02 Don’t you agree?
00:06:03 These are valuable lessons
00:06:05 that help us to understand Jehovah’s thinking
00:06:09 and to adapt our imperfect thinking to his.
00:06:13 Now, as a part of using this as an illustration,
00:06:17 the New World Translation  takes a little over 500 words
00:06:20 to tell this story,
00:06:23 but less than 10 words are used
00:06:25 to describe the wrongdoing of the prodigal son.
00:06:29 If you look at verse 13, it says
00:06:32 he was “living a debauched life.”
00:06:35 And then in verse 30, (a few more details) it says
00:06:38 that he ‘squandered his belongings with prostitutes.’
00:06:43 So here is an example of a story that contains some wrongdoing,
00:06:48 but in no way does it spotlight it,
00:06:50 glorify it, or make it attractive.
00:06:54 Rather, it draws us closer to Jehovah God,
00:06:57 helping us to understand his forgiving nature.
00:07:01 That’s just why the story was written.
00:07:05 Now, we can only imagine how Satan would twist the story line
00:07:10 of the prodigal son.
00:07:13 Would he portray the father as restrictive and intolerant?
00:07:19 Would he show the rebellious son’s home life
00:07:22 as oppressive, stifling his independence?
00:07:28 Would he insert some disrespectful or obscene language in the script?
00:07:35 How much time do you imagine that he would devote
00:07:38 to the immoral aspects of the story?
00:07:42 And when the son returns home, would he be repentant?
00:07:46 Or would the father be portrayed as mellowing
00:07:50 and becoming tolerant?
00:07:54 Might the son even return home with one of the women that he was with?
00:08:00 You see, with Satan’s stories, when we read between the lines,
00:08:05 there’s always filth and untruth.
00:08:08 The story content is a repeating plot
00:08:13 —a plot of rebellion, of violence, and of immorality.
00:08:18 See, it’s the same basic story
00:08:21 told over and over again
00:08:24 with different characters.
00:08:27 But with Jehovah’s stories, when we read them,
00:08:30 we discover something every time.
00:08:34 In fact, when we meditatively read between the lines,
00:08:39 the story blossoms, doesn’t it?
00:08:41 It seems that no matter how often we read the story,
00:08:45 we learn something about Jehovah
00:08:48 that we can adapt to our own thinking.
00:08:51 So in making decisions regarding entertainment,
00:08:55 we need to reason on the matter:
00:08:59 Who is teaching me?
00:09:02 Will the entertainment refresh me
00:09:05 and accomplish something good for me?
00:09:08 Or is there a chance that it will undermine my faith in Jehovah God?
00:09:13 If in doubt, wouldn’t it be wise to simply refrain?
00:09:19 So while in this system, we need to be careful
00:09:22 about our entertainment choices.
00:09:25 Let’s be taught by Jehovah
00:09:27 so that we can think and feel
00:09:30 and reason on matters as he does
00:09:33 as we look forward to the time
00:09:35 when the only option available to us
00:09:38 will be safe and wholesome entertainment.

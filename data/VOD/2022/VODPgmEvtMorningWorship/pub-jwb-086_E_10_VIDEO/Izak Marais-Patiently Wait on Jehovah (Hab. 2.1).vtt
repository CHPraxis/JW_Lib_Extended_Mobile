00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:05.555 line:10% position:50% align:center
The world is in chaos.

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:08.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
This system of things is disintegrating

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.628 line:10% position:50% align:center
—the world economy, health systems,

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:16.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
security, governments—
and we know where this all is leading.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s leading to the great tribulation.

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked yourself,

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do I have enough faith

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:32.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to face these fear-inspiring events

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
with “the joy of Jehovah”?’

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:42.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can learn much
from the example of Habakkuk.

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lived in a similar time.

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:46.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah inspired him to give

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
this prophecy about 20 years before

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:54.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
the destruction
of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.

00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:01.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our daily text comments highlight

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
three lessons we can learn

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:06.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the book of Habakkuk.

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says there: “Never stop praying,

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . listen to what Jehovah tells us
through his Word and organization . . . ,

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and patiently wait on Jehovah.”

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us take those three points
and discuss them briefly.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:28.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one: “Never stop praying.”

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:33.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habakkuk, in chapters 1 and 2,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
is engaged in a dialogue with Jehovah God.

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you look here in chapter 1,

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 1-4,

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s asking Jehovah very intensely,

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:52.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why do you allow violence,

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrongdoing, oppression, injustice?’

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
It concerned him very much.

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jehovah answered Habakkuk
from verses 5-11,

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:09.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah says something
very interesting in verse 5.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:
“Something will happen in your days

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you will not believe
even if it is told to you.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:23.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
For here I am raising up the Chaldeans,”
the Babylonians.

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:28.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah was going to bring Babylon

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:33.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring judgment and punishment
on the evildoers.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah answered his prayer.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:43.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also are affected by injustice,
are we not?

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother here at Bethel recently told me

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was watching a news program,

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reporter was explaining

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:57.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the obvious and terrible
injustices that were happening.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:01.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “It got me very tense.

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to shut the television off.”

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he said: “I talked to Jehovah.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Afterward,” he said,

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:16.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I calmed right down,
and my confidence returned.”

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
So prayer is very important.

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:23.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
It puts us in the right frame of mind,
but it doesn’t end there.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to go to the next step,

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of listening to what Jehovah tells us

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:33.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his Word and his organization.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we can take the example
from Habakkuk here in chapter 2.

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:43.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helps us to see a procedure,

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
a process, or an approach that he took.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, in Habakkuk 2:1,

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says: “At my guardpost
I will keep standing,

00:03:55.852 --> 00:04:00.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will station myself on the rampart.”

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:02.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he says:

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:06.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will keep watch to see
what he will speak by means of me

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what I will reply
when I am reproved.”

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see the two things he was doing?

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:16.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was keeping standing

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, the next thing, he was keeping watching.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
So “keep standing.”

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:27.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this particular case, he says he
“will station [himself] on the rampart.”

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:30.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a rampart, in those days,

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
could often have been a wall around the city

00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a huge, strong wall.

00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:37.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in other words,
he was keeping himself

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:41.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a position of safety, first of all.

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then secondly, he “[watched] to see.”

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:49.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
He listened to what Jehovah was telling him.

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:53.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you know,
listening has two components.

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:57.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
The one part is hearing,
getting the sense of it.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the second part is acting upon it.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here Jehovah was speaking to Habakkuk.

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:07.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 2, Jehovah answered him,

00:05:07.924 --> 00:05:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah said: “Write down the vision,

00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:16.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and inscribe it clearly on tablets,

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:20.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the one reading aloud from it
might do so easily.”

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very interesting
that Jehovah gives him

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:25.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
an assignment
to write this down.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:29.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah also reveals
that he had in mind for someone

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read it aloud,

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:36.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
to spread his message to others.

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:42.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can follow that example of Habakkuk.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, place ourselves

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Jehovah’s protection,

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on [our] rampart,” as it were,
under the mighty hand of God.

00:05:52.135 --> 00:05:54.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t leave that safe place.

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:57.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then secondly, listen.

00:05:57.373 --> 00:06:01.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be ready to respond
to whatever Jehovah tells us to do.

00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we stay in our place?

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:05.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we stay focused on our assignment.

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:07.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have work to do.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must preach and teach and do our part
in the Christian congregation.

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we listen by being

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:19.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
very carefully attuned to God’s organization,

00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
the leading we receive
from God’s organization.

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot anticipate
what is going to happen next.

00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:31.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, for instance, with this pandemic,
who of us expected that?

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:35.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look how beautifully Jehovah’s people
—his organization—

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:39.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
led us through these very difficult times.

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:44.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
This now brings us to the third aspect,
patiently wait.

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:49.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is that matters are going
to get far worse than they are now.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we shouldn’t be surprised
if our reaction is the same

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:59.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
as that of Habakkuk when he
started anticipating what was coming.

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:03.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us read Habakkuk 3:16.

00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:08.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:
“I heard and I trembled within;

00:07:08.244 --> 00:07:10.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the sound my lips quivered . . .

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:13.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
My legs beneath me were shaking.”

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:19.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he says
(the second part of verse 16):

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:23.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I quietly wait for the day of distress.”

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:28.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
That reaction is not a lack of faith,
“but . . . quietly wait”

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s evidence of true faith.

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:33.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Habakkuk was not naive.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew what was coming.

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:40.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He describes here in verse 17:
“The fig tree may not blossom, . . .

00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no fruit on the vines;
the olive crop may fail, . . .

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:47.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fields may produce no food.”

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:50.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
So food may run short.

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Property may be lost.

00:07:53.322 --> 00:07:56.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Standards of living may go down.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question is, How will we respond?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will be our reaction?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we quietly wait

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:09.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and patiently, calmly
accept whatever happens,

00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:11.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if the sequence of events

00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:15.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not exactly what we expect them to be?

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:17.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson is at Habakkuk 2:3;

00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:25.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has an appointed time.

00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:28.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says the vision is
“for [the] appointed time, . . .

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in expectation of it! . . .

00:08:31.294 --> 00:08:33.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will not be late!”

00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what matters is not

00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:43.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the end will come
or how the end will come

00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:47.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that we live a life of faith

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing Jehovah’s will.

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
So back to the question,

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:53.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do I have enough faith
to go through

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
the upcoming fear-inspiring events
and keep my joy?

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Habakkuk 3:18, he ends the chapter.

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “As for me,

00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:07.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will exult in Jehovah;

00:09:07.597 --> 00:09:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.”

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the bottom line?

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:19.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray, listen, and wait patiently.

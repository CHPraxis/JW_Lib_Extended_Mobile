00:00:01 I think all of us have had
00:00:03 very interesting experiences with young ones,
00:00:06 and we could go on quite a while
00:00:08 speaking about them.
00:00:10 But there is a story
00:00:12 about a “child psychologist
00:00:15 “who began his practice with four theories
00:00:20 “and no children. . . .
00:00:23 “Some years later he found that he had four children
00:00:27 and no theories!”
00:00:30 He learned that there was quite a bit to do.
00:00:34 There was a lot to do to raise a child.
00:00:37 It was far more than just a few theories.
00:00:40 And this was a comment that was reported by psychologist Bruce Narramore
00:00:45 and published in the Awake! of April 8, 1981.
00:00:50 So theories about child raising come and go,
00:00:53 and the best counsel on raising a child, of course, is found in the Bible.
00:00:58 We know that, because it’s been there for thousands of years,
00:01:02 and it’s consistent.
00:01:04 It’s consistently successful.
00:01:07 There’s another interesting point
00:01:09 that there is four times as much counsel
00:01:12 given to children in the book of Proverbs
00:01:15 as given to adults.
00:01:17 That might surprise you, but that’s what I read, so I believe it.
00:01:22 Proverbs 22:6 is a familiar scripture for all of us.
00:01:27 Proverbs 22:6, and here it says:
00:01:31 “Train a boy in the way he should go;
00:01:35 even when he grows old he will not depart from it.”
00:01:41 Is that true?
00:01:43 Yes, it’s true.
00:01:45 Does it mean that in every case
00:01:47 a boy that’s well-trained by his parents won’t depart from it?
00:01:51 No. It does not mean that.
00:01:53 It’s giving a general, overall view
00:01:56 of what will take place
00:01:58 if a child is trained properly by his parents.
00:02:02 And what it is, this is an interesting brief statement
00:02:06 from The Watchtower  of 2008, April 1st
00:02:10 that if a child is trained according to the Bible’s counsel,
00:02:14 the parent or parents “are creating
00:02:17 “the most favorable circumstances
00:02:19 to bring about a marvelous result.”
00:02:23 That marvelous result is
00:02:25 a faithful servant of Jehovah God.
00:02:28 And we can turn to Proverbs 23:24
00:02:31 where reference is made to that
00:02:34 —Proverbs 23:24.
00:02:36 And how many parents are so delighted with their children,
00:02:40 especially in the case of so many who are serving at Bethel!
00:02:44 There at Proverbs 23:24, it says:
00:02:47 “The father of a righteous one will surely be joyful;
00:02:52 whoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him.”
00:02:56 And it does; it brings great pleasure to parents when that happens.
00:03:00 But there’s another side to the coin.
00:03:02 Despite the most earnest efforts of parents,
00:03:06 some children do become unfaithful.
00:03:10 Think about Solomon.
00:03:12 He wasn’t a child, but actually,
00:03:15 it’s very difficult to understand
00:03:17 how that man turned away from Jehovah in his old age, but he did.
00:03:21 And then even Jehovah had sons who proved unfaithful.
00:03:25 That’s what the June 1, 2007, Watchtower
00:03:28 showed clearly, and we’re all familiar with it
00:03:30 —the angels who turned away from their Father, their Creator.
00:03:34 And something to keep in mind
00:03:36 for parents, particularly, who have really tried hard
00:03:39 to raise their children properly,
00:03:42 we don’t want to see them beat themselves figuratively speaking,
00:03:46 on and on for years and years
00:03:48 because they feel like they’re failures.
00:03:50 They should not do that.
00:03:52 How do you account —if it seems to some parents
00:03:55 that know somehow they failed—
00:03:57 Well then, how do you account for children
00:03:59 who receive no help whatsoever from their parents
00:04:02 and they love Jehovah and they come into the truth?
00:04:06 It’s heart—heart condition.
00:04:09 So parents would be wise to focus on the future and what they can do,
00:04:14 not to look back and beat themselves
00:04:16 over problems of the past.
00:04:19 And even when children do turn aside from serving Jehovah,
00:04:23 parents who have conscientiously trained their children
00:04:27 in the way to walk,
00:04:29 they can still entertain the hope
00:04:31 that those young ones will come back some day.
00:04:34 We never give up on our kids.
00:04:37 We don’t give up on our close friends or siblings
00:04:40 who may have walked away from the truth.
00:04:42 We always hope that they’ll come back.
00:04:45 Psalm 19:7 is interesting
00:04:49 —Psalm 19:7—
00:04:53 speaking of the reminders of Jehovah.
00:04:58 There it reads: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength.”
00:05:03 And then it says: “The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,
00:05:07 making the inexperienced one wise.”
00:05:10 Well, for those who leave the truth,
00:05:13 many times it’s reminders that come back to them
00:05:16 —the way it was at home, the counsel they received from their parents,
00:05:20 the loving congregation that they attended.
00:05:24 And who comes to mind when you think about the reminders coming to mind
00:05:29 after living a life of debauchery?
00:05:32 The prodigal son.
00:05:34 He was at his lowest, and then who did he remember?
00:05:38 His father —his father, who undoubtedly had shown
00:05:42 kindness and love to him.
00:05:44 So we don’t want to overlook
00:05:46 the power there is in parental training.
00:05:49 Even though they may not respond
00:05:51 —children may not respond— immediately,
00:05:54 they do many times later on.
00:05:56 And they go through experiences in life, sometimes,
00:05:59 that wake them up to the facts of life and reality.
00:06:04 The truth is there are thousands upon thousands
00:06:06 of children of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:06:08 who are being raised in the truth and whose way “is pure and right.”
00:06:12 It really is thrilling to see young ones who are able to think.
00:06:16 They don’t just parrot what their parents tell them.
00:06:18 They’re not just memorizing things.
00:06:20 They’ve learned to have thinking ability, and they can speak about the truth.
00:06:24 They defend the truth in a very interesting way.
00:06:28 In Britain, Tim and Sam, both 11 years old and unbaptized publishers,
00:06:33 were engaging in field service with Tim’s mother.
00:06:37 The boys needed new bags to carry their Bibles and literature,
00:06:41 but money was a problem.
00:06:43 Earlier, before starting in the field service that day,
00:06:46 the mothers of the two publishers made this a subject of prayer.
00:06:51 At the last house to be visited that morning,
00:06:54 Tim spoke to the householder and read a Bible verse to her.
00:06:58 She interrupted him to ask what his religion was.
00:07:02 When Tim replied that he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:07:05 the woman scolded him
00:07:07 and said to his mother that she could not understand
00:07:10 why Jehovah’s Witnesses let their children die
00:07:12 rather than allow them to accept blood transfusions.
00:07:16 Now, that would be a difficult thing to have thrown in your face
00:07:19 for a young man there at the door with his mother.
00:07:22 Tim’s mother suggested that the woman ask the boys
00:07:26 how they felt about this.
00:07:29 She did.
00:07:30 Tim explained that he would always choose alternative treatment
00:07:34 rather than go against his Bible-trained conscience.
00:07:38 This was from this young boy himself.
00:07:41 Sam then said, the other young boy,
00:07:45 that his own sister had received alternative treatment
00:07:48 and had fared better than patients who had received blood.
00:07:54 Then the householder again turned to Tim’s mother,
00:07:56 and this time she expressed disapproval
00:07:59 of taking young children from door to door.
00:08:02 We’ve heard that many times, I’m sure.
00:08:05 Both of the boys responded to the woman on this occasion
00:08:08 that they enjoyed preaching, adding that they preferred this
00:08:12 to roaming the streets like others of their age.
00:08:16 Well, this slowed the householder down a bit.
00:08:18 She was impressed by their reply.
00:08:21 The householder asked the boys to wait a moment
00:08:23 while she went into her house.
00:08:25 What a surprise they had when she returned and presented each of them
00:08:30 with a smart, new, leather bag
00:08:32 ideal for their ministry!
00:08:35 She sold these items for a living.
00:08:37 Her changed attitude also allowed the boys to arrange for a return visit.
00:08:42 And as they were leaving,
00:08:44 the householder’s 94-year-old mother, who had been listening,
00:08:48 came to the door and asked Tim’s mother
00:08:51 to visit her at her home.
00:08:54 Truly, we are proud of our young ones.
00:08:57 And it’s a delight when you hear them
00:08:59 make comments at the meetings in their own words
00:09:03 and when you are out in the field ministry with them
00:09:06 and you see them make expressions of faith.
00:09:09 We have thousands upon thousands of good children
00:09:13 who really are showing that they’re mature and that they love Jehovah God.

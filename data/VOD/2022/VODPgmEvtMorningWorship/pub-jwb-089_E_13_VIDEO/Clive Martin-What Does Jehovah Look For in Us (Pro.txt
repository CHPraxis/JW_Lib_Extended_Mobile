00:00:02 Our sacred service is our sacrifice,
00:00:05 our gift to Jehovah.
00:00:08 But here’s a key point:
00:00:10 Before Jehovah looks at our gift,
00:00:13 he looks at us.
00:00:15 He must accept us first if he’s to accept our gift.
00:00:20 So here’s the key question, then:
00:00:22 What does Jehovah look for in us?
00:00:26 We’re going to use three Bible examples to explore that question.
00:00:31 Let’s begin in the Most Holy of the tabernacle
00:00:34 on the Day of Atonement.
00:00:37 The high priest’s mission is to offer a sin offering
00:00:40 for himself and for the nation.
00:00:43 But before he can do that, Jehovah tells him to do something very specific,
00:00:48 as depicted here.
00:00:50 It’s recorded at Leviticus chapter 16,
00:00:54 verses 12 and 13.
00:00:57 So please turn with me to that —Leviticus chapter 16—
00:01:01 the first time he enters the Most Holy on that day.
00:01:05 “He will then take the fire holder
00:01:07 “full of burning coals from the altar before Jehovah
00:01:10 “and two handfuls of fine perfumed incense,
00:01:13 “and he will bring them inside the curtain.
00:01:16 “He will also put the incense on the fire before Jehovah,
00:01:19 “and the cloud of the incense will envelop the Ark cover, which is on the Testimony,
00:01:24 so that he may not die.”
00:01:28 Clearly, from that last phrase,
00:01:31 Jehovah needed to approve of the high priest and what he did
00:01:35 if he was to accept the sin offering.
00:01:39 He had to bring in incense.
00:01:44 In the Bible, incense is associated with prayer.
00:01:48 So clearly, the high priest had to come in
00:01:50 with a humble, prayerful attitude.
00:01:55 Imagine, though, if he decided to bring his own incense recipe
00:01:59 because he preferred that smell.
00:02:02 Was Jehovah likely to accept that?
00:02:06 Or what if he followed the procedure perfectly
00:02:10 but yesterday he was leading the nation in worship to Molech?
00:02:15 Would Jehovah approve of what he did on this day?
00:02:19 So, what qualities was Jehovah looking for in the high priest?
00:02:28 A humble, prayerful attitude;
00:02:31 strict obedience to direction;
00:02:34 moral and spiritual integrity.
00:02:39 Everything on that day, the high priest and his sin offering,
00:02:44 pictured Jesus Christ.
00:02:47 So, what can we learn from Jesus while he was on earth?
00:02:51 There’s a beautiful description at Hebrews 5:7, 8.
00:02:56 So let’s read that verse together,
00:02:59 and pick out what this tells us about Jesus.
00:03:02 Hebrews 5:7, 8:
00:03:05 “During his life on earth, Christ offered up
00:03:09 “supplications and also petitions,
00:03:11 “with strong outcries and tears,
00:03:14 “to the One who was able to save him out of death,
00:03:17 “and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.
00:03:21 “Although he was a son, he learned obedience
00:03:25 from the things he suffered.”
00:03:28 Supplications and petitions—
00:03:32 Although he was the perfect son of God,
00:03:35 Jesus humbly recognized his total dependence on his Father.
00:03:41 From verse 8, it’s easy to pick up that key quality.
00:03:46 He was perfectly obedient
00:03:49 in carrying out Jehovah’s will for him.
00:03:52 And what about this phrase at the end of verse 7:
00:03:55 “He was favorably heard for his godly fear”?
00:04:00 Yes, Jesus’ fervent desire to please Jehovah in everything
00:04:05 —that was the source of his perfect integrity.
00:04:10 The question, though, is why?
00:04:12 What moved Jesus to do these things?
00:04:16 Well, in his own words, John 14:31:
00:04:19 “In order for the world to know that I love the Father.”
00:04:25 What did Jehovah see in Jesus?
00:04:29 He saw remarkable humility;
00:04:32 total dependence on his Father;
00:04:34 perfect obedience;
00:04:36 flawless integrity;
00:04:39 and the purest of motives —love for his Father.
00:04:46 It’s no wonder that Jehovah looked down and said:
00:04:50 “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”
00:04:54 Jehovah approved of Jesus,
00:04:56 and he approved of the ransom sacrifice.
00:05:00 So now it’s down to us.
00:05:02 What is Jehovah looking for in you and me?
00:05:05 Well, as with Jesus, he’s looking
00:05:07 for the right qualities and the right motive
00:05:11 —so qualities and motive.
00:05:14 That’s familiar to us, even in human relationships.
00:05:18 We’ve all seen the picture of a sheepish husband who comes home
00:05:22 carrying a big bouquet of flowers.
00:05:25 Well, he’s done something that’s going to make his wife angry when she finds out,
00:05:30 and he wants to appease her to make her less angry.
00:05:35 Is she going to be happy with that?
00:05:37 She may accept the flowers,
00:05:39 but she does not want to be appeased.
00:05:42 What she wants is a loyal husband
00:05:46 to give her a gift because he loves her
00:05:50 —qualities and motive.
00:05:53 With this in mind, let’s learn one further lesson
00:05:57 from the example of King David.
00:05:59 Jehovah had told David that he would not be the one
00:06:03 that would build the temple,
00:06:05 and David obeyed Jehovah’s direction.
00:06:07 But he loved pure worship.
00:06:09 He wanted to do something.
00:06:12 So David carefully studied the temple plan that Jehovah gave him,
00:06:16 and then he brought Jehovah a gift,
00:06:20 and what a gift it was, from his personal fortune
00:06:23 —gold, silver, and so many other things!
00:06:26 You know, just the gold and silver from his personal fortune
00:06:31 was worth almost six billion dollars.
00:06:36 Now, when David was ready to present that gift to Jehovah,
00:06:40 he said a special prayer.
00:06:42 And we’re going to look at it in 1 Chronicles chapter 29.
00:06:48 Verses 10-17 is the prayer.
00:06:50 It’s worth its own study project.
00:06:53 But we’ll look at just a few key points.
00:06:55 Please look to see what each of these reveals
00:06:58 about David as the giver of the gift.
00:07:02 So 1 Chronicles 29:14:
00:07:08 “Who am I and who are my people
00:07:10 “that we should be in a position to make voluntary offerings like this?
00:07:15 “For everything is from you,
00:07:17 and we have given to you what comes from your own hand.”
00:07:22 Wow!
00:07:23 Despite his rank, his seniority,
00:07:26 David humbly recognized what a privilege it was
00:07:30 to be able to do anything for Jehovah.
00:07:34 Now glance down at verse 17.
00:07:37 What would make Jehovah approve of this gift?
00:07:42 “I well know, O my God, that you examine the heart
00:07:46 “and that you take pleasure in integrity.
00:07:51 “In the uprightness of my heart,
00:07:53 I have voluntarily offered all these things.”
00:07:57 That’s why Jehovah would approve the gift.
00:08:00 Now, bear in mind, David has just presented to Jehovah
00:08:05 billions of dollars worth of gifts.
00:08:09 And yet look at verse 13,
00:08:13 this is his motive:
00:08:15 “And now, O our God, we thank you
00:08:19 and praise your beautiful name.”
00:08:23 His gratitude moved David to give
00:08:26 everything that he possibly could to Jehovah.
00:08:32 So how are we like David when we give gifts to Jehovah?
00:08:37 We humbly recognize what a privilege it is
00:08:40 to be able to do anything for Jehovah.
00:08:43 We keep strict obedience to direction.
00:08:47 We fight to maintain our integrity,
00:08:49 and it’s our love and our gratitude
00:08:51 that moves us to give Jehovah
00:08:54 everything that we can
00:08:56 —our very best.
00:08:59 When Jehovah sees these qualities and these motives in us,
00:09:04 then he’s very pleased,
00:09:06 and he will be pleased to accept our gift,
00:09:08 whether we give him the fortune of David or the widow’s mite.
00:09:14 So, what gifts will you bring to Jehovah today?
00:09:19 May Jehovah smile when he sees you,
00:09:23 and may he approve of your good qualities and your good motive,
00:09:28 and may he turn your gift into a blessing for you and for many others.

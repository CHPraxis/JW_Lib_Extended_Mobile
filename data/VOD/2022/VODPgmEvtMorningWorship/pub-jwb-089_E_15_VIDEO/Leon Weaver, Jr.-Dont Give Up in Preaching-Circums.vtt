00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our text this morning
is taken from the article

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Why We ‘Keep Bearing Much Fruit.’”

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.463 line:10% position:50% align:center
And the article offered four major reasons

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:18.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
why you and I preach today.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:22.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first reason given was to glorify Jehovah

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to sanctify his name before mankind.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:29.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second reason given was

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show our heartfelt love

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah and for Jesus.

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the third reason given was

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:42.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we preach to give a warning.

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was none of those three

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was going to emphasize
in my discussion today.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to talk about the fourth reason.

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:57.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
We preach because we love our neighbor

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we love our neighbor.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Watchtower</i>  study article
made a very powerful point

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:08.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows what’s involved

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:13.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
in showing our love
for our neighbor this way.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what it stated:

00:01:16.092 --> 00:01:21.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are moved by such love
to endure in this work,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“recognizing that people

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may have a change of heart

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
when their circumstances change.”

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does this thought register in us?

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to see why
we should always be positive and enthusiastic

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to sharing
in the preaching work.

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know what the person

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
to whom we are going to speak

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:50.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
is thinking at that particular visit.

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:56.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study article used an example

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a jailer at the time

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Paul and Silas
were arrested in Philippi.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened while they were there in jail?

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was an earthquake and things shook.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the jailer thought that all the prisoners

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been shaken out of their shackles

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:17.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they were able to get out of there.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:22.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the account at Acts chapter 16,

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:27.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 27 says

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:32.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the jailer feared
that the prisoners had fled

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and was about to kill himself.”

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Paul called out . . . :
‘Do not hurt yourself.’”

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:46.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
The distressed jailer asked:

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What must I do to get saved?”

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:52.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul and Silas told him:

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:55.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Believe in the Lord Jesus,
and you will get saved.”

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we learn something from this.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we can meet people

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of their current circumstance,

00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t get a listening ear.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look at what happened to this jailer.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was making sure everybody

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
was soundly bound in the jail.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then when this earthquake came,

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:21.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had a change of thought

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his change of circumstance.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should we learn from this?

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can happen when it comes
to our preaching activity too.

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:37.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why in our midweek meetings,

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have all of these demonstrations

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how we can go about in our preaching work

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:46.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to touch the hearts of people.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some individuals did not respond

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Bible’s message before

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:56.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we called on them before.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they may have a change of heart
and look for help

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
when their world is suddenly shaken

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:06.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
like this jailer’s world was shaken

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
when that earthquake took place.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:12.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we never know when something like this

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:15.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
has happened in the lives of people.

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why when we go,

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should always have
that positive state of mind.

00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:24.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m reminded of an experience

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I heard some time ago:

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister had been to a house
in her territory a number of times.

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:33.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every time she returned,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
this woman at the house was very rude.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this day, she knocked on the woman’s door

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the same woman answered.

00:04:46.502 --> 00:04:50.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what the woman said to our sister,

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve been waiting for you to return.”

00:04:52.842 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister was shocked

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear this woman
who’d always been so rude

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
make such an expression.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what she said.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:08.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
The woman said: “I had a relative
in another part of the country call me.

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And that relative told me

00:05:11.494 --> 00:05:15.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that if I would invite you in when you came,

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:19.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you would take my Bible
and show me in my own Bible

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:23.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that hell is not a place
of fire and torment.

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to show me that.”

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it resulted not only in showing

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also in a productive Bible study
for this woman.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what else could change

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:41.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
a person’s whole attitude toward us

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:43.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our preaching work?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could have been diagnosed
with a very serious illness.

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:52.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or they may be heartbroken over losing

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:57.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
a loved relative, or family member, in death.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
When such events take place,

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:03.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
some distressed individuals

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:07.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
may ask us questions
about the meaning of life.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at one time,
those were questions they ignored.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might call at their door

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:17.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even be working on a job with them

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:21.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they have
this negative experience in their life

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like the earthquake
that the jailer experienced.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:29.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s our love for people that moves us

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take advantage of the opportunities

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:35.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have to help people

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they’re in the proper mood and attitude

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:41.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
for receiving the message.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
This particular article
that we’re studying today

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned a pioneer brother.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:52.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had been a pioneer for some 34 years.

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what the article
quoted him as saying,

00:06:56.232 --> 00:07:00.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
capturing this point
that we’re making here this morning.

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:04.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:
“Today, more than ever,

00:07:04.407 --> 00:07:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people feel emotionally low.”

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:13.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our objective is to keep preaching.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:16.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah brings forth the fruitage.

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are His and the angels’ fellow workers.

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:26.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
I put a little more emphasis on that point
because we should always think of that.

00:07:26.762 --> 00:07:29.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not ever in this service by ourselves.

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:32.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is interested in those people;

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angels are interested in those people.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they know things about those people
that we don’t know

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:42.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of their invisible presence

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:45.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their personal interest in mankind.

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Jehovah brings forth the fruitage.

00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are His and the angels’ fellow workers.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:03.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another pioneer who has been pioneering
over 30 years, Robert,

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:07.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
was quoted as saying,
“To work along with angels who know

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:12.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is going on in the householders’ lives
is exciting.”

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:16.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought of that
as you go forth into the preaching work,

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:20.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have angelic company?

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:23.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those angels know what’s going on.

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 2008, we had an <i>Awake!</i>  article,

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the article was entitled

00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:35.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can the Problem of Crime Be Solved?”

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was February 2008.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the book 

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:48.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Inside the Criminal Mind </i>

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
was written by Dr. Stanton E. Samenow.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the article,

00:08:56.352 --> 00:09:00.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
it told us to consider
the example of a woman

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:03.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had been molested as a child.

00:09:03.593 --> 00:09:05.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
She took up drugs;

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
she abused alcohol and used tobacco.

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:12.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the time that the article was written,

00:09:12.902 --> 00:09:17.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was serving a life sentence in prison.

00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
But while in prison,
she began to study with us.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that prison circumstance

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:30.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
changed her vantage point and her viewpoint.

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:33.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, anyhow, she studied with us,

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:38.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she took to heart what she was learning.

00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:42.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the article says:
“Now she is no longer a slave

00:09:42.898 --> 00:09:46.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to destructive thinking and vices.

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One of her favorite Bible texts

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:53.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is 2 Corinthians 3:17, which states:

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now Jehovah is the Spirit;

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:59.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and where the spirit of Jehovah is,

00:09:59.749 --> 00:10:02.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is freedom.’”

00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:06.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we love the people out there.

00:10:06.622 --> 00:10:10.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we don’t give up
in our efforts to help them

00:10:10.393 --> 00:10:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why we keep getting
at our midweek meeting

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
this encouragement to keep preaching

00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to have a positive attitude.

00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we don’t know

00:10:22.405 --> 00:10:26.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
who or what kind of individual

00:10:26.776 --> 00:10:30.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to be talking to at each door.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we should always have
that positive attitude.

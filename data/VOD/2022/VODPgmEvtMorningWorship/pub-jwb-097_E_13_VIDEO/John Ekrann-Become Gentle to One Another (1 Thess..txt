00:00:01 Our text for today,
00:00:02 1 Thessalonians 2:7,
00:00:04 is part of a very warm,
00:00:07 comforting, and encouraging letter
00:00:09 —1 Thessalonians.
00:00:11 It’s clear from the tone and message
00:00:13 that the apostle Paul
00:00:14 really loved the brothers and sisters in Thessalonica.
00:00:18 He was there at the founding of the congregation,
00:00:20 and he saw the persecution  that they endured with the Jews
00:00:25 when they tried to come into the truth,
00:00:27 and he knew the persecution they were still going through.
00:00:30 He was concerned about them, and he wanted to come see them in person.
00:00:35 If you look at 1 Thessalonians 2:17,
00:00:40 he says: “But when we were separated from you, brothers,
00:00:43 “for just a short time (in person, not in our hearts),
00:00:48 “because of our [very] strong desire,
00:00:51 we made every effort to see you in person.”
00:00:56 He was concerned about them; he really wanted to know how they were doing.
00:01:00 But isn’t that a nice expression that Paul uses
00:01:03 that while he couldn’t be there “in person,”
00:01:05 he was with them ‘in his heart’?
00:01:08 We feel the same way today when we’re separated from our families,
00:01:12 our congregations, and our close friends.
00:01:15 We are with them, not “in person,”
00:01:18 but we’re with them “in our hearts.”
00:01:21 Since he couldn’t be there in person, Paul sent Timothy.
00:01:25 And Timothy came back with a very good report
00:01:27 about how the brothers and sisters were doing.
00:01:30 And then Paul writes this inspired letter of 1 Thessalonians to them.
00:01:34 Now, 1 Thessalonians is an excellent example
00:01:38 of a well-written and encouraging letter.
00:01:41 If you’re looking for ideas on how to write an encouraging letter to others,
00:01:45 1 Thessalonians is a good example to study and look at.
00:01:50 It’s a very heartfelt and meaningful letter.
00:01:54 If you read or listen to the whole letter (it only takes about 15 minutes),
00:01:58 you can easily imagine that Paul was alive today
00:02:02 and wrote that letter to you and your congregation.
00:02:05 It’s so warm and encouraging that you may want to listen to it several times.
00:02:10 It feels really appropriate to the trials and challenges
00:02:14 that we, many of us, are facing today.
00:02:17 Let’s take a look at a few verses from 1 Thessalonians
00:02:21 that can help us to endure our current trials.
00:02:23 And we’re going to cover four basic themes:
00:02:26 commendation, gentleness,
00:02:29 friendship, and consolation.
00:02:32 First, let’s talk about commendation.
00:02:34 If we look at 1 Thessalonians 1:3
00:02:38 —so all these verses are from 1 Thessalonians—verse 3, chapter 1:
00:02:43 “For we continually remember your faithful work, your loving labor,
00:02:47 “and your endurance because of your hope
00:02:50 in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father.”
00:02:54 Yes, look for occasions to commend others
00:02:58 and be as specific as possible.
00:03:02 One sister got a text message recently
00:03:06 from another sister thanking her and her husband for something
00:03:09 they had done over ten years ago for that couple.
00:03:12 Well, how do you feel when you receive a well-written card,
00:03:16 text message, or email that commends you for something that you have done
00:03:21 or recalls something that you did for someone?
00:03:24 You feel encouraged and strengthened; you feel happy.
00:03:29 See, commendation helps all of us to know
00:03:31 that others see the good that we’re doing, and they appreciate it.
00:03:36 The apostle Paul described his reaction
00:03:39 when he got the good report from Timothy about how they were doing.
00:03:43 He used a phrase in chapter 3 and verse 8
00:03:45 —he said: “We are revitalized.”
00:03:48 And isn’t that a good way to put it?
00:03:50 When we get commendation and we hear a good report, we’re revitalized.
00:03:56 Now next, after commendation,
00:03:58 let’s consider our text for today, chapter 2 and verse 7.
00:04:03 He said: “On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst,
00:04:07 as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.”
00:04:11 Yes, gentleness.
00:04:14 When you get a cut on your hand
00:04:16 and someone else wants to help you take care of it,
00:04:19 how do you want that cut to be handled?
00:04:22 Gently. It hurts.
00:04:24 Well, emotionally, many people today are really hurt,
00:04:29 and we need to care for them gently.
00:04:32 Are our conversations,
00:04:34 our text messages, emails, letters—
00:04:38 Are we gentle?
00:04:41 With the stress and pressures of life in this old system,
00:04:45 it can be easy to be abrupt, or curt,
00:04:47 or short, in our dealings with others.
00:04:50 When we’re going to send an email,
00:04:52 do we read it over and think for a moment before we press Send?
00:04:57 If you receive an email that’s very strong
00:05:00 or a bit biting, are we gentle in our response,
00:05:04 realizing that others are also feeling the emotional strain of things?
00:05:09 Do we take time to express our tender heart and care?
00:05:14 For example, we may send a card or a text message
00:05:18 with a couple of scriptures cited, and this is always appreciated.
00:05:22 But one sister said that what she appreciated even more
00:05:25 was when someone sent a card and they
00:05:27 actually wrote out the phrase in the scripture
00:05:30 that they appreciated and said why
00:05:32 that scripture or phrase meant something to them.
00:05:38 After gentleness, he mentions friendship.
00:05:42 Let’s look at chapter 2 and verse 8:
00:05:48 “So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you,
00:05:52 “not only the good news of God but also our very selves,
00:05:56 because you became so beloved to us.”
00:06:00 Well, that expression ‘impart to you our very selves’ is powerful.
00:06:05 Paul was not just their Bible teacher, but he was a close friend.
00:06:11 All of us need close friends
00:06:13 —especially these days— ones that you can talk to,
00:06:17 express your feelings to, and be confident that they’re going to listen
00:06:21 and respect your thoughts and privacy.
00:06:25 Paul came to really love the brothers and sisters in Thessalonica.
00:06:28 He did not treat them as a to-do list, checking off things or say,
00:06:32 “This is my job to teach them the Bible” and move on.
00:06:36 The relationship went deeper than that.
00:06:39 Now, we may work together; we may be in the same congregation;
00:06:43 we may have a meal together,
00:06:45 but that does not automatically make us friends.
00:06:49 The old saying ‘to have a friend, you have to be a friend’
00:06:52 illustrates that being a friend really takes
00:06:55 a lot of effort and work on our part.
00:06:58 Are we true friends with others?
00:07:01 Are we taking the initiative to make close friends?
00:07:06 As Paul says, it really means giving
00:07:09 of “our very selves.”
00:07:13 Now, after friendship, he mentions consoling.
00:07:15 If we look at chapter 2 and verse 11,
00:07:20 he says: “You well know that we kept exhorting and consoling you
00:07:25 “and bearing witness to each one of you,
00:07:27 just as a father does his children.”
00:07:31 Well, earlier, the apostle Paul had used a mother
00:07:34 to illustrate gentleness.
00:07:37 Now he uses a father to illustrate consoling.
00:07:41 We can see that the apostle Paul really felt like he was family
00:07:45 with the congregation there in Thessalonica.
00:07:51 Now, life has some very sad and tragic events.
00:07:56 And a good father knows how to console and comfort his children
00:08:00 when things go wrong and bad things happen.
00:08:03 Paul knew that the Thessalonians
00:08:08 were actually going through a tough time,
00:08:10 and many of them had suffered
00:08:12 the loss in death of friends or family.
00:08:15 Notice his very consoling reasoning in chapter 5
00:08:21 in which we’ll just read one verse about the hope of the resurrection.
00:08:26 Let’s look at verse 10:
00:08:28 “He died for us,
00:08:30 “so that whether we stay awake or are asleep,
00:08:34 we should live together with him.”
00:08:38 Well, that’s so consoling, isn’t it?
00:08:41 Death does not break that person’s relationship with Jehovah.
00:08:47 Alive or dead, Jehovah loves all of us.
00:08:53 So if we review,
00:08:55 the inspired advice
00:08:57 in Paul’s warm and loving letter
00:09:00 to his friends in Thessalonica can encourage all of us to commend,
00:09:05 to be gentle, to show true friendship,
00:09:08 and to console one another.
00:09:12 And as we head deeper into this old system,
00:09:15 it’s kind of like watching the chaos on a ship
00:09:18 when the passengers realize that the ship is sinking.
00:09:23 We, though, on the other hand, are in the lifeboats, and we’re together.
00:09:27 We’re trying to help one another
00:09:30 make it through this situation until we can be rescued.
00:09:34 We’re comforting, consoling, and helping one another
00:09:37 and waiting to be rescued.
00:09:40 So to all of you, we can say the words of chapter 5 and verse 11:
00:09:45 “Therefore, keep encouraging one another
00:09:48 “and building one another up,
00:09:51 just as you are in fact doing.”

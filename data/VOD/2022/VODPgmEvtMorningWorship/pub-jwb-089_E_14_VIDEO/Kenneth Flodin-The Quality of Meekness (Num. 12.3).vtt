00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:02.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Numbers 12:3:

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:06.022 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Moses was by far

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:08.091 line:10% position:50% align:center
the meekest of all the men.”

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.796 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, when we analyze our own personality,

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:16.466 line:10% position:50% align:center
how many of us zero in on meekness?

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
That might not be the first quality
that comes to mind.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:23.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may think that it’s rather benign,

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
innocent, maybe even inconsequential.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think: ‘You know, I have other

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘bigger issues I need to deal with first.

00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I need to work on being more courageous,

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
impartial, loving, forgiving, discerning.’

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a whole list
of other qualities might come to mind.

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, meekness might sound
benign and inconsequential.

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
In reality,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:54.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a very complex quality
and quite diverse.

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please find Exodus chapter 2.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Moses born meek,

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
sweet, and complete?

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, there’s no indication
that meekness is an innate quality.

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true that at Exodus 2:2

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
it does say that when he was born,
Moses was beautiful.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:22.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it does not say he was meek.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:29.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses was raised in the arrogant,
haughty family of Pharaoh

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:33.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the world-renowned leader at that time.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was not taught to be meek
during his adolescent years.

00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:41.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned thus far?

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s actually encouraging.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not have to be born with meek genes

00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
or with a predisposition to meekness
in order to attain that quality.

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t have to have
the perfect upbringing to cultivate meekness.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:56.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
With time and patience,

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us can attain that quality.

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Moses can be described

00:02:02.438 --> 00:02:06.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “by far [by far]
the meekest of all the men.”

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was in a category all by himself.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did that happen?

00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he was actually coached

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trained personally by Jehovah.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah obviously saw the potential in Moses

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of those qualities
he might have developed

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his upbringing in Pharaoh’s house

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:28.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
—dignity, confidence

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
(sometimes overconfidence), poise.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
But of all those acquired gifts,

00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:37.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could not use him
to his maximum potential

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
until—until— he cultivated meekness.

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was not a 40-day curriculum.

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:48.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a 40-year lesson

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:53.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
of contemplation and cultivating humility.

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:56.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was just a shepherd
and not even of his own sheep.

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:58.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was his father-in-law’s sheep.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:02.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with his changed situation
and having some time on his hands,

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was now able to contemplate
the type of man he was

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the type of God he served.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he changed.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
He developed this quality of meekness.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Insight </i> book
describes meekness this way,

00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:22.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ll see it is a complex quality.

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “[It’s] a mildness of temper,
without haughtiness or vanity.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The mental disposition that enables one

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:34.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to endure injury with patience

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and without irritation, resentment,

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
or vindictive retaliation.”

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a tall order, isn’t it?

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, one <i>Watchtower</i>
described meekness

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a ‘piece of artwork

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
painted by a skilled artist.’

00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, look at the artwork there;

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s beautiful.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses, in the development of meekness,

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:01.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
was so beautiful to Jehovah

00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:05.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He made sure
it was put under the spotlight

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:09.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“by far the meekest of all the men.”

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:11.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the point of similarity

00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
between a piece of artwork and meekness?

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the artist

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to blend colors
together deftly and skillfully,

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a variety of colors comes together.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:28.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those three primary colors
on a color wheel,

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:31.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s red, yellow, and blue.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by mixing these colors together,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
an artist can paint
a beautiful, tranquil painting.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you see in the image

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:40.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the secondary colors,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you mix red and yellow together,

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:45.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
what color do you see between them?

00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s orange.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you mix yellow and blue together,
what color do you see then?

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see green.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you mix red and blue together,
it produces violet or purple.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the artist
further mixes colors together,

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he can get all the hues necessary

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:07.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
to paint a beautiful, tranquil scene.

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point of similarity?

00:05:11.127 --> 00:05:13.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meekness is not one color.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not just one quality.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s blending many
different qualities together

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a skilled fashion.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
To achieve meekness,

00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:26.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
it requires that we
mix together various virtues

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:29.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
like humility,

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:32.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
lowliness of mind, gentleness,

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:37.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
patience, mildness of temper, long-suffering.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like an artist, if we work
on all those qualities simultaneously,

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
the result is this beautiful masterpiece

00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:46.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we call meekness.

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:49.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn now to Numbers chapter 12.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to reason on verse 3
from a different aspect.

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so there it is again, verse 3:
“Now the man Moses was by far

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
the meekest of all the men
on the face of the earth.”

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
So leave your Bible open there for a moment.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:08.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Question: Who wrote those words?

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:11.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those were Moses’ own words.

00:06:11.354 --> 00:06:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so some commentators
have criticized this,

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that this was unjustified self-praise,

00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:22.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
somewhat like a person who says of himself,

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m humble and I’m proud of it.”

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at the context first here.

00:06:30.673 --> 00:06:34.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
The situation is described
at Numbers 12:1, 2.

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:37.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses’ sister and brother
challenged his authority

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the official spokesman for Jehovah.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Miriam was listed first in this mutiny.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was the oldest of the three siblings.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses was the youngest.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:53.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s apparent that Miriam
was the instigator,

00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you glance down there in verse 10,

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:59.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the two, she was the only one
struck with leprosy.

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember meekness,
the definition, part of it, was:

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:07.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Endures injury
with patience without irritation,

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
resentment, or retaliation.”

00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:12.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Moses absorbed

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:17.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
this withering,
blistering provocation meekly.

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:19.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now look at the end of verse 2;

00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:22.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Jehovah was listening.”

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah was right there.

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:28.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw and heard the level of vehemence.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what was Moses’ relationship
with Jehovah?

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Face-to-face I speak to him,
openly, not by riddles;

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the appearance
of Jehovah is what he sees.”

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:46.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we understand, of course,
that this was through an angel.

00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:49.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Moses had this two-way communication

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
directly with Jehovah.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, <i>Insight</i>  had
a significant statement, I thought.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said that “Moses . . . had a more direct,

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“constant, [and] intimate
relationship with Jehovah

00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
than did any [other] prophet
prior to Jesus Christ.”

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s quite a statement, isn’t it?

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about it.

00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:14.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus came,
he superseded Moses’ status

00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:19.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at that point,
Jesus became ‘by far the meekest man’

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:21.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ever walked the earth.

00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus say
about himself at Matthew 11:29?

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I am mild-tempered
and lowly [of] heart.”

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meekness.

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:37.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was that unjustified
self-praise on his part?

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it was unvarnished truth.

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:45.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s similar with Moses
and the way he described himself.

00:08:45.308 --> 00:08:48.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true, he penned the words,

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:51.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we must never forget
those were not his words.

00:08:51.514 --> 00:08:53.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was inspired by God.

00:08:53.549 --> 00:08:56.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the meekest of all men.

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, was he perfect in this quality?

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:00.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all recall the rash action on his part

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he struck the rock to bring forth water

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the credit for the miracle he took away

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah and applied to himself.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:14.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was a huge mistake

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Moses regretted
for the rest of his life.

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:19.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah took the insult seriously;

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:22.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did not allow him
to enter the Promised Land.

00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did Jehovah view Moses after that?

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:29.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Find Deuteronomy 34:10.

00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:34.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses was still viewed by Jehovah

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the finest example of all men.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Deuteronomy 34:10 says:
“But there has never again

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses,
whom Jehovah knew face-to-face.”

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:48.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a complimentary line about Moses.

00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who wrote Deuteronomy?

00:09:50.606 --> 00:09:52.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses.

00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:56.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in this case, these
were not his words penned down.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:59.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had already died,
you see, in verse 5 there.

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:04.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so <i>Insight</i>  attributes
these final inspired words of the book

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Joshua, the writer
of the next book of the Bible.

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:13.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So meekness, it’s a complex
and beautiful quality

00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:17.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can strive to more fully achieve.

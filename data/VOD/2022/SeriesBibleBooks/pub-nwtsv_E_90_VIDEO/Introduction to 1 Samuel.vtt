In the original Hebrew canon,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First and Second Samuel were one volume.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The writing is attributed to the prophets

Samuel penning the first 24 chapters.

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.254 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First Samuel covers a period

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.548 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of just over 100 years,

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from about 1180 to 1078 B.C.E.,

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.054 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
roughly when the writing was completed.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book is largely
about four leaders in Israel

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—High Priest Eli, the prophet Samuel,

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Saul, and David.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 1, a barren woman named Hannah

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begs Jehovah for a son,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
promising to devote him to God’s service.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God answers her prayer.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her child, Samuel, is weaned,

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she places him in the care of High Priest Eli

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Shiloh.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 3,

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells young Samuel

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver a judgment message
against Eli’s house

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he has failed
to rebuke his wicked sons.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4, Philistines
capture the ark of the covenant

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Israel’s army camp

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and slay Eli’s two sons,

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hophni and Phinehas.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When 98-year-old Eli hears the news,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he falls backward and dies.

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:42.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 5 through 7,

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Philistines return the ark to Israel

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after suffering a series
of heavy punishments from Jehovah.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the next chapter,
the Israelites faithlessly demand a king.

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 9, Jehovah tells Samuel

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to anoint Saul of the tribe
of Benjamin as leader of Israel.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 11 shows that Saul starts out well.

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before long, he becomes disobedient.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 13,

00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he presumptuously
offers up a burnt sacrifice.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 15, he defeats the Amalekites

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but disobediently spares King Agag

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the best of the herd and the flock.

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To obey is better
than a sacrifice,” Samuel says.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then tells Saul that God

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has rejected him from being king.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 16, Samuel anoints David,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a son of Jesse, to be the next king.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the next chapter, David,
with just a sling and a stone,

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kills the giant Goliath,
a champion of the Philistines.

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 18 records
the start of a lifelong friendship

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between David and Saul’s son Jonathan.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing David’s courage,

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:13.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul puts him in charge of the fighting men.

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s campaigns are so successful

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he receives more praise than Saul,

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who becomes filled with murderous envy.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 19, David flees for his life,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remaining a fugitive until Saul’s death.

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:35.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know?

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Samuel has valuable lessons

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about faith and obedience.

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eli and Saul disobeyed Jehovah
and came to a tragic end.

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel and David, however,

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served God faithfully from their youth,

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:55.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus enjoying his blessing
throughout their lives.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 24 and 26,

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:04.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David has opportunities to kill Saul,

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he refuses to harm Jehovah’s anointed.

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 25,

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:15.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel dies and all Israel mourns.

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David, now in the wilderness of Paran,

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sends ten of his young men

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a wealthy sheep owner called Nabal

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask for provisions.

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Nabal insolently refuses to help,

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:35.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David prepares to take revenge.

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Nabal’s wife, Abigail,

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quickly goes to David
with provisions and averts tragedy.

00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:46.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 31, First Samuel closes

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:49.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the death of Saul and three of his sons,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are buried under a tamarisk tree

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:54.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jabesh-Gilead.

00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you read First Samuel,

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Eli and Saul
brought disgrace upon themselves,

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see why Jehovah loved Samuel and David,

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:12.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read how God built
for David a lasting house,

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:14.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which eventually led to the Messiah

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the King of God’s Kingdom.

00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:05.568 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to 2 Samuel.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the original Hebrew canon,

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 and 2 Samuel were one volume.

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:15.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophets Gad and Nathan,

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
who completed the writing of 1 Samuel,

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrote all of 2 Samuel.

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.960 line:10% position:50% align:center
The narrative covers a period

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.087 line:10% position:50% align:center
of some 37 years

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:29.133 line:10% position:50% align:center
from 1077 to about 1040 B.C.E.,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.135 line:10% position:50% align:center
when the writing was completed.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.971 line:10% position:50% align:center
Second Samuel begins

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:36.348 line:10% position:50% align:center
shortly after the death of King Saul

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:38.517 line:10% position:50% align:center
and concludes just before the death

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:40.603 line:10% position:50% align:center
of King David.

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:45.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book is an intimate and honest account
of David’s life,

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he sought to follow Jehovah
with all his heart.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 1,

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:55.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
David receives tragic news

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Saul and his son Jonathan
have died in battle.

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deeply grieved,

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
David composes a dirge
and calls it “The Bow.”

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rest of 2 Samuel
can be divided into two sections.

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:14.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
Chapters 2 to 4

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.972 line:10% position:50% align:center
cover David’s kingship over Judah;

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:19.266 line:10% position:50% align:center
chapters 5 to 24

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.936 line:10% position:50% align:center
cover his rule over all Israel.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 2,
David goes to Hebron,

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he is made king
over the tribe of Judah.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Saul’s army chief, Abner,

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes Saul’s son Ish-bosheth
king over the other tribes.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 3 and 4, however,

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abner and Ish-bosheth are put to death,

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the following chapter,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people make David king over all Israel.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
David then captures
the Jebusite stronghold of Zion

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and moves his capital there from Hebron.

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:01.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zion becomes known also
as the City of David.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 6,

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
David has the ark of the covenant
brought to Jerusalem.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:10.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 7,

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
David tells Nathan that he would like

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a house,
or temple, for Jehovah.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
But God gives this privilege
to a future son of the king.

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, out of love for David,

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah makes a covenant
with him for an everlasting kingdom.

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 8 and 10
tell about David’s victories

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the Amalekites, Moabites,

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philistines, and other enemies.

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapter 11 brings us to one
of the darkest periods in David’s life.

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
He commits adultery with Bath-sheba,

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
she becomes pregnant,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David has her husband, Uriah,
killed in battle.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 12,

00:02:55.362 --> 00:03:00.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nathan, at Jehovah’s direction,
reproves David.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also says that calamity
will befall David’s house

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Bath-sheba’s newborn son will die.

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bath-sheba, who is now David’s wife,

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:15.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
becomes pregnant again
and gives birth to Solomon.

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:18.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 13 to 18,

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:22.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
the foretold calamities
on David’s house begin.

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:28.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
David’s son Absalom conspires
to usurp the throne,

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:30.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David is forced to flee Jerusalem.

00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:33.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 18,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
David’s men defeat Absalom’s

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:39.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Joab puts Absalom to death.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Samuel powerfully illustrates
the Bible’s honesty.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:51.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even the failings of Israel’s great leaders

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
are openly exposed.

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:57.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also see that truly repentant sinners,

00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
while reaping what they have sown,
can be forgiven.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 23,

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
David humbly acknowledges:

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spirit of Jehovah spoke through me;

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:15.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
his word was on my tongue.”

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:18.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 24,

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is incited to register the nation.

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
This bad act angers Jehovah,

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
who brings a scourge on the people.

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the prophet Gad’s direction,

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
David buys the threshing floor
of Araunah the Jebusite,

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:35.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
builds an altar there,

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:38.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and offers up sacrifices to God.

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Jehovah’s command,

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:44.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scourge against Israel is halted.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read 2 Samuel,

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how honestly God’s prophets recorded

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:53.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel’s history,

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:57.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
observe how sin can have tragic consequences,

00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note God’s promise

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:02.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give David a lasting kingdom

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a promise fulfilled in Jesus Christ,

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:08.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Son of David” and King of God’s Kingdom.

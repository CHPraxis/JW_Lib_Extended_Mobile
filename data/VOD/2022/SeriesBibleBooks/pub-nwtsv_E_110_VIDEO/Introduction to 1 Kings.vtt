00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:05.150 line:10% position:50% align:center
An introduction to 1 Kings.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
First and Second Kings
were originally one volume,

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was later made into two.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah is believed to be the writer.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
First Kings continues

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.250 line:10% position:50% align:center
where Second Samuel leaves off.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.043 line:10% position:50% align:center
The account covers a period

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.671 line:10% position:50% align:center
of some 129 years,

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.382 line:10% position:50% align:center
beginning about 1040 B.C.E.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
with King David’s final days

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.554 line:10% position:50% align:center
and ending in about 911 B.C.E.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:35.890 line:10% position:50% align:center
when King Jehoshaphat dies.

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:40.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first part of the book,
after the death of King David,

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel enjoys peace and prosperity

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Solomon’s rule.

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the second part, false worship takes root

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Israel is split into two kingdoms.

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 1, Solomon is anointed as king.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 3, Jehovah blesses King Solomon

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
with extraordinary wisdom,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with riches and glory.

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:11.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 4, God’s people prosper

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Solomon’s rule.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chapters 5 through 8 discuss

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
the construction of the temple,

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
the making of its utensils,

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Solomon’s dedication prayer.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 10, the queen of Sheba

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
hears a report about Solomon

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then travels to Jerusalem to see him.

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
After observing the king’s wisdom

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prosperity, she says:

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! I had not been told the half.”

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 11, Solomon,

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
in disobedience to Jehovah,

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:46.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“loved many foreign women.”

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
These pagan wives
gradually incline Solomon’s heart

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worship other gods,

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Ashtoreth and Milcom.

00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reigning for 40 years, Solomon dies

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his son Rehoboam takes the throne.

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 12, Rehoboam promises

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
to add to the already heavy burden
on the people.

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:14.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ten tribes revolt
and make Jeroboam their king.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rehoboam is left with the tribes

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Judah and Benjamin.

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeroboam sets up the worship
of golden calves

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discourage his subjects
from worshipping in Jerusalem.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Idolatry becomes entrenched
in the northern kingdom,

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:32.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this leads to oppression,

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
power struggles, and assassinations.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapters 14 and 15,

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.807 line:10% position:50% align:center
Rehoboam and Abijam after him

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:43.392 line:10% position:50% align:center
allow false worship

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:45.602 line:10% position:50% align:center
to take root in the southern kingdom.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.523 line:10% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.150 line:10% position:50% align:center
About 33 years

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.610 line:10% position:50% align:center
after Solomon inaugurated the temple,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah allowed Pharaoh Shishak

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
to plunder its treasures.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.784 line:10% position:50% align:center
This shows that Jehovah is pleased,

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:03.203 line:10% position:50% align:center
not by impressive buildings,

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.622 line:10% position:50% align:center
but by pure worship.

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:09.376 line:10% position:50% align:center
In chapter 15,

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
Asa becomes king in Jerusalem

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:15.132 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he does what is right in God’s eyes.

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:17.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
He is succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat,

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.054 line:10% position:50% align:center
who imitates his good example.

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:22.056 line:10% position:50% align:center
The next chapter mentions

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:23.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
a number of wicked kings

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.684 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the northern kingdom.

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:27.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
These include Ahab,

00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:30.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
who marries the pagan princess Jezebel.

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:34.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
She and her husband
bring Baal worship into the kingdom.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 18, the prophet Elijah

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:40.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
proposes a test on Mount Carmel

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show who is the true God—Jehovah or Baal.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah demonstrates that he is the true God.

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 19, Elijah flees for his life

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:56.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he receives a death threat from Jezebel.

00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah appears to Elijah at Mount Horeb

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and comforts him in “a calm, low voice.”

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives Elijah further assignments.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the final chapter, Ahab disregards

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:13.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Micaiah’s warning
against fighting Syria.

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:17.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, Ahab is killed in battle.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
His son Ahaziah takes the throne in Israel.

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Jehoshaphat also dies,

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:27.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his son Jehoram becomes king in Judah.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.209 line:10% position:50% align:center
As you read 1 Kings,

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
note how false worship

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:36.463 line:10% position:50% align:center
leads to great suffering,

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:38.882 line:10% position:50% align:center
see how true worship promotes

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.135 line:10% position:50% align:center
peace and happiness,

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.929 line:10% position:50% align:center
and take comfort that Solomon’s wisdom

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.683 line:10% position:50% align:center
pales in comparison to that of Jesus Christ,

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:50.894 line:10% position:50% align:center
the incorruptible King of God’s Kingdom.

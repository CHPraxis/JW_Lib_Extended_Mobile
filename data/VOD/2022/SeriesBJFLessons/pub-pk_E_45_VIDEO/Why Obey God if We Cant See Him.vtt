Hey, Sophia. Want the answer?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s OK.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what happened after the math test?

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tried to give her the answer but—

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, why didn’t you take the answer?

00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:35.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, you could be the best in the class.

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:39.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some things are just more important.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like being honest.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia, if you did take the answers,
who would know?

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah.

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why obey God
if we can’t even see him?

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, umm.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad,

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can I show Zoe that Jehovah sees us?

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:21.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:25.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t see Jehovah,
but how do you know he’s there?

00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the Bible.

00:01:28.604 --> 00:01:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Zoe just started learning.

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:33.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
True.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of something from Jehovah
she’s already seen?

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:38.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Creation!

00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:48.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the last paragraph here.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is the one who made all these things.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God made the heavens and the earth.

00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:56.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made people too.”

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:01.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are your favorite things that God made?

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love sunsets,

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
fruit,

00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
playing with my dog,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my mom!

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:14.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww,

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:16.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made those things
because he loves you.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I can’t see him,

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
my favorite things remind me
that Jehovah sees me

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:28.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and that you always want
to listen to him.

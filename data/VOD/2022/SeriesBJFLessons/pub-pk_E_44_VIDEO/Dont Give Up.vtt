Hi, I’m Sophia.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a great video
about God’s promise for the earth.

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, sweetheart, thank you.

00:00:12.437 --> 00:00:14.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not interested.

00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:21.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can read the Bible and watch videos.

00:00:21.812 --> 00:00:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really busy, kid.

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:34.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we take a break?

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:38.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
A break already?

00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:46.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
A break might be nice.

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:49.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before we go, do you 

00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember when Jesus preached?

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:53.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did everybody listen to him?

00:00:55.437 --> 00:00:56.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:00.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why didn’t Jesus give up?

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he wanted everyone
to hear the good news.

00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:07.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:11.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how about we each try another house?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh!
Hi, Chuck!

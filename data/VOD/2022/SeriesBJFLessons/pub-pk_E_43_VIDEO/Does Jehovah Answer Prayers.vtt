Hey, Sophia, we know you’re in there.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Jehovah, make it stop!

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:10.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heh, heh, heh.

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:11.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a loser!

00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:13.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loser.

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:14.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go.

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:15.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, let’s get out of here.

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, class,

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
today we’re going to discuss—

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:45.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia? You’re late.

00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:49.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry. Uh, I was—

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll talk about this later.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oooooooooo.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, OK. That’s enough.

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:58.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia, take your seat.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re going to discuss the difference

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between division and long division.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, class.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the results from yesterday’s test.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good work, Sophia.

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Angela.

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you get?

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:24.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t care.

00:01:25.937 --> 00:01:26.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:28.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
D plus?

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at least there’s a plus.

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you looking at?

00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:39.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, hehe.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia.

00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:10.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhhh!

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhhh!

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oops! I didn’t see you there.

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like you’re invisible.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, what’s this?

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:35.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you tomorrow.

00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:37.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loser.

00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:52.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you OK?

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:55.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me help.

00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:59.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they pick on me too.

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:11.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing!

00:03:11.146 --> 00:03:13.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Ms. Wilson said I could hold the bunny,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I had to be very gentle.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:17.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I named him Fred.

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:22.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t get to hold him for very long.

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m pretty much a bunny expert now.

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! Is everything all right, Honey?

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:33.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um . . .

00:03:35.312 --> 00:03:37.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you tomorrow.

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:41.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m fine.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:53.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about something very important:

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:54.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayer.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:56.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb,

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what are some things that you can pray for?

00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:02.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can pray for things

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:04.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make me happy

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a helicopter

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a mountain of ice cream

00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:20.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—uh, without the bellyache—

00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Fred!

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But tell me: When we pray before bedtime,

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:32.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we pray for?

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:36.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jehovah for the good things he made

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, like, animals,

00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stars, and the ocean

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:45.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and God’s Kingdom

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help our brothers and sisters!

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:49.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right!

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:52.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can pray for your brothers and sisters.

00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember,

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are praying for you too.

00:04:55.604 --> 00:04:58.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that when we pray for the right things,

00:04:58.396 --> 00:04:59.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hears us!

00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why doesn’t he answer <i>my</i>  prayers?

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:06.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! What’s wrong, Sophia?

00:05:06.396 --> 00:05:07.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can tell us.

00:05:09.563 --> 00:05:11.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a girl at school.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so mean to me.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:05:19.063 --> 00:05:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Honey, it’s OK.

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:25.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for it to stop,

00:05:25.063 --> 00:05:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nothing’s happened.

00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:30.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah mad at me?

00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:32.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, my dear.

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah isn’t mad at you.

00:05:35.688 --> 00:05:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe Jehovah can’t see me!

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:05:43.813 --> 00:05:45.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is someone in the Bible

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who felt the same way you do.

00:05:48.771 --> 00:05:53.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her name was Hannah.

00:05:56.688 --> 00:06:00.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah loved Jehovah very much.

00:06:00.146 --> 00:06:02.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, wait for me!

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:06.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But someone named Peninnah

00:06:06.104 --> 00:06:08.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was very mean to her.

00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so nice to see the children play,

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it?

00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:15.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had a bully too?

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:06:21.688 --> 00:06:23.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re ready to eat.

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s your portion, Hannah.

00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:27.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Peninnah, here’s yours.

00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very jealous of Hannah.

00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I’ll get some water.

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think you’re so special, Hannah?

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why hasn’t Jehovah given <i>you</i>

00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any children?

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you OK, Hannah?

00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you so sad?

00:06:59.563 --> 00:07:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others could not understand

00:07:01.063 --> 00:07:03.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why Hannah was so upset

00:07:03.354 --> 00:07:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the pain was in her heart.

00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:09.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she talked to the One

00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:11.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who <i>would</i>  understand.

00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah, please, see me.

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:32.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember me.

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:35.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do not forget me.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:39.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give me a child.

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:41.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do,

00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:44.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will give him to you all his life

00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:46.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve you.

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:54.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing?

00:07:54.813 --> 00:07:56.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you drunk?

00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:00.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not drunk.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m under great stress.

00:08:04.021 --> 00:08:05.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.

00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been praying for Jehovah to help me.

00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:13.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go in peace,

00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:14.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may Jehovah give you

00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:16.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you’ve asked for.

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know why Hannah felt better

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though her prayer wasn’t answered yet?

00:08:26.188 --> 00:08:27.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:08:28.146 --> 00:08:30.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Hannah knew Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah listens to your prayers,

00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:37.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he really listens.

00:08:37.938 --> 00:08:39.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he knows just what we need

00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even better than we do.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does he answer them?

00:08:45.938 --> 00:08:48.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lots of different ways.

00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:51.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, we just have to wait and see.

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s busy?

00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:54.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:08:54.646 --> 00:08:56.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it can be hard for us

00:08:56.438 --> 00:08:58.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the answer.

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:01.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about what you can pray for . . .

00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and what you can do tomorrow at school

00:09:04.313 --> 00:09:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work along with those prayers.

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that Angela and the other girls

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to be mean to me.

00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:18.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But please help me

to be like Hannah tomorrow.

00:09:22.105 --> 00:09:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help me to be strong like her.

00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:33.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she went to the tabernacle,

00:09:33.355 --> 00:09:34.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Eli was there.

00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:36.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the high priest.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s them! Run!

00:10:01.563 --> 00:10:03.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look who it is.

00:10:03.563 --> 00:10:05.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look over there. It’s them!

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think she did?

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:07.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did she say?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there about to be a fight?

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:14.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angela would win.

00:10:14.688 --> 00:10:16.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you want, Angela?

00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:18.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I was just wondering

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:20.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you had a pen that I can borrow.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Agh!

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do I do?

00:10:31.105 --> 00:10:33.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:10:36.146 --> 00:10:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, it’s me, Caleb.

00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:40.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please help Sophia.

00:10:43.813 --> 00:10:46.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help Sophia be strong at school today.

00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:50.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watch over the children in our congregation

00:10:50.896 --> 00:10:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Caleb and Sophia.

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:55.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch over our children.

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help our children make you proud, Jehovah.

00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:00.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Jehovah, give our children

00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:01.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the strength they need to face pressures.

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, please!

00:11:03.813 --> 00:11:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need your help!

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask you this prayer in Jesus’ name.

00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:13.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:17.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen.

00:11:18.272 --> 00:11:20.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What? Are you gonna cry?

00:11:21.563 --> 00:11:23.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, Angela.

00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:24.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re being mean.

00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:26.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you keep being mean,

00:11:26.563 --> 00:11:28.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to tell.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you won’t.

00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:31.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I will.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t tell me what to do.

00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:36.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go, Zoe.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my sister!

00:11:46.938 --> 00:11:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re so brave.

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:50.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you do that?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for courage, and Jehovah helped me.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:05.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah gave birth to a son

00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and named him Samuel

00:12:07.147 --> 00:12:09.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as she said, . . .

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is from Jehovah that I have asked him.

00:12:16.147 --> 00:12:19.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no one holy like Jehovah.

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:22.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no one but you.

00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:30.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:00:01 So to answer the question,
00:00:04 Why keep on the watch?
00:00:07 there is a simple, direct answer.
00:00:09 But we have a second reason as well
00:00:12 to share during this talk.
00:00:15 Find Mark,
00:00:20 and we’re going to read
00:00:22 chapter 13.
00:00:25 And it leads to our main reason why,
00:00:29 but the context will really help us
00:00:33 in verse 32.
00:00:36 Let’s read that: “Concerning that day or the hour
00:00:41 “nobody knows,
00:00:43 “neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father.
00:00:48 “Keep looking, keep awake,
00:00:51 “for you do not know when the appointed time is.
00:00:55 “It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house
00:00:58 “and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work,
00:01:02 “and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch.
00:01:06 “Keep on the watch, therefore,
00:01:09 “for you do not know when the master of the house is coming,
00:01:14 “whether late in the day or at midnight
00:01:16 “or [at] dawn or early in the morning,
00:01:20 “in order that when he comes suddenly,
00:01:24 he does not find you sleeping.”
00:01:28 Now, that’s our Lord and Master
00:01:32 —very direct.
00:01:34 He’s compassionate (true) but direct.
00:01:37 And then the main reason why—verse 37:
00:01:42 “What I say to you, I say to all
00:01:46 “[so it’s being repeated to all of us listening]:
00:01:51 Keep on the watch.”
00:01:54 Very simple, very direct.
00:01:58 That’s what is expected.
00:02:00 However, and I appreciated—
00:02:02 I hadn’t heard Brother Cook’s talk
00:02:06 (knew about the details and such),
00:02:08 but he emphasized for all of us, and it’s connected here,
00:02:13 Jehovah as a God of comfort.
00:02:17 So while it’s true that we want to sometimes address directly
00:02:22 the things that Jesus has taught us,
00:02:25 it doesn’t mean that Jehovah is
00:02:28 no longer a God of comfort.
00:02:31 He wants to comfort us.
00:02:34 So this is the second reason.
00:02:36 If you’ll find Isaiah,
00:02:39 we’re going to read in chapter 48.
00:02:43 And it’s a very fine thought
00:02:46 about why keep on the watch.
00:02:50 In verse 17—very familiar to us—
00:02:52 you’ll see the point:
00:02:56 “This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,
00:02:59 “the Holy One of Israel:
00:03:01 “‘I, Jehovah, am your God,
00:03:05 “‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,
00:03:09 the One guiding you in the way you should walk.’”
00:03:14 Now, how we appreciate the footnote
00:03:18 that adds depth to what Jehovah is saying here:
00:03:23 “Or ‘for your own good’”!
00:03:27 Isn’t that priceless?
00:03:29 Why keep on the watch?
00:03:34 It’s for our own good.
00:03:36 It really is.
00:03:38 And that’s the point Jesus and Jehovah want us to take away.
00:03:43 We’re trying to address that with this talk
00:03:46 because some of you have been serving Jehovah
00:03:50 for a long time.
00:03:53 And I’m not going to stare at anybody
00:03:55 because I know different ones,
00:03:57 and it’s just amazing how Jehovah
00:04:01 has been there for you all these years.
00:04:06 But you’re only human.
00:04:08 And we’ll address some concerns that some raise.
00:04:11 And I just want to have you think about this here
00:04:16 —a personal experience.
00:04:18 Many years ago, my sons, Jesse and Paul,
00:04:22 were in the early years of school
00:04:26 —elementary school.
00:04:28 And back at the time— I haven’t heard it a lot lately,
00:04:32 but from time to time, this would come up at a social gathering.
00:04:36 Now, mind you, they’re
00:04:38 in second grade and first grade,
00:04:41 but these boys were thinkers.
00:04:45 So they’d listen, and they appreciated all these older ones.
00:04:49 We had a number of them in Rhode Island
00:04:52 —longtime servants of Jehovah God.
00:04:55 However, from time to time—this statement—
00:04:58 they’d be looking at my sons and say:
00:05:00 “Oh, you’ll never graduate in this system.
00:05:05 It’s not going to happen.”
00:05:08 So, you know, I’m at their house; they just fed us.
00:05:14 Lord, help me. What am I going to do here?
00:05:17 But this would come up from time to time, at least during those years.
00:05:21 And maybe it was post-1975.
00:05:24 I don’t know.
00:05:26 But they’d make these statements.
00:05:27 And I’m going to give you a big confession
00:05:30 because, you know, this one comes clear to mind.
00:05:33 Driving back from the gathering,
00:05:37 Jesse and Paul are, you know, thinking and they’re troubled.
00:05:41 They’re puzzled. What is this about?
00:05:44 Because, you know, they had goals.
00:05:46 “What are we going to do?”
00:05:47 And they’re thinking of the things in the future for them
00:05:51 as they’re growing in their love for Jehovah.
00:05:55 “Is that true, Dad?”
00:05:58 And so I’d say, “Look . . .”
00:06:00 And let me tell you, these people saying these things
00:06:02 were longtime servants—experienced people.
00:06:06 If any of you are guilty, God loves you. He forgives you.
00:06:10 If you did that back then, you didn’t help anybody.
00:06:15 But I’m going to give you a big confession.
00:06:18 So that one particular night, we’re driving back
00:06:21 —it was a little distance from where we were—
00:06:24 and they brought that up.
00:06:26 They’re sitting in the back seat, and we’re having this conversation.
00:06:29 And I told them—I said: “Look, you boys remember,
00:06:35 “you got to keep on the watch.
00:06:38 This thing could go on, and be ready for it to go to 2020.”
00:06:45 Honest.
00:06:47 I mean, we’re talking almost 40 years —almost 40 years.
00:06:52 I felt pretty safe with that.
00:06:58 But you know what year this is.
00:07:00 What are you going to do?
00:07:03 But at least I’m happy to say
00:07:06 that they and my wife and their wives
00:07:10 are all still keeping on the watch.
00:07:13 We have been and plan to continue
00:07:17 to keep on the watch.
00:07:20 Now, this is just something to address
00:07:23 —the feelings that some have.
00:07:26 And these are beautiful friends
00:07:29 —different ones worshipping Jehovah for many decades.
00:07:34 And we’re only human.
00:07:37 It’s the truth,
00:07:39 but we’re only human.
00:07:42 So one brother wrote,
00:07:44 and I appreciated his sincerity.
00:07:47 He said:
00:07:49 “During the annual meeting of 2019,
00:07:52 “the Ramapo project was announced.
00:07:56 “And if I remember right,
00:07:58 “it was stated that the project would be complete in a few years.
00:08:04 “With recent Watchtower  articles telling us
00:08:06 “that we are in ‘the last of “the last days”’
00:08:11 “[beautiful expression, but words are powerful],
00:08:15 “it seemed a little disappointing
00:08:18 that this may push Armageddon off a few years.”
00:08:23 This was his sincere concern—really.
00:08:27 And you know he’s not alone.
00:08:30 They’re only human.
00:08:33 Well, how should we respond?
00:08:36 A brother wrote that in.
00:08:38 Well, remember, Jehovah is a God of comfort.
00:08:43 You want to go direct.
00:08:45 It’s what we addressed there with what Jesus told us.
00:08:48 But how can we comfort him too?
00:08:53 Bring the truth as it is, and be straight with it.
00:09:00 The Governing Body wants all of you to know
00:09:04 (including those that will see it later)
00:09:07 that we are determined to remain active
00:09:11 and to faithfully deliver spiritual food
00:09:15 at the right time.
00:09:18 We are also looking beyond the last days.
00:09:22 You’re getting that message.
00:09:25 Let me expound on that thought:
00:09:28 looking beyond the last days.
00:09:31 This is a quote from the Proclaimers  book.
00:09:35 I treasured it when the book came out,
00:09:38 and a lot of work went into that publication.
00:09:41 But there, referring to God’s people, it stated—
00:09:47 You know, there was a lot of international construction
00:09:50 going on at the time too, if you were in the truth then.
00:09:53 I’m quoting it now: “With the help of Jehovah’s spirit,
00:09:57 “they [God’s people] want to give the greatest witness possible
00:10:02 “during the time that remains before Armageddon.
00:10:06 “They are convinced
00:10:08 “that God’s new world is very close at hand,
00:10:12 “and they have faith
00:10:14 “that they will survive as an organized people
00:10:18 “into that new world, under the rule
00:10:21 of God’s Messianic Kingdom.”
00:10:23 Now, please note the rest of this quote:
00:10:29 “It is also their hope that perhaps
00:10:32 “[key word]
00:10:34 “many of the fine facilities that they have built
00:10:38 “and dedicated to Jehovah
00:10:40 “will continue to be used after Armageddon
00:10:44 “as centers from which knowledge of the only true God
00:10:48 can be diffused until it truly fills the earth.”
00:10:53 Beautiful thought.
00:10:55 It’s right there—still valid.
00:10:59 So in harmony with what the faithful slave said then,
00:11:04 the faithful slave now says
00:11:07 that many of the projects that are being worked on now
00:11:11 —like Ramapo, the Good News According to Jesus  video series—
00:11:16 may or perhaps
00:11:22 will carry over into the new world
00:11:25 to assist the great crowd with the work ahead
00:11:29 and perhaps
00:11:31 include resurrected ones.
00:11:34 That’s comforting.
00:11:36 You have to let that sink in.
00:11:41 Now we want to conclude
00:11:43 with expressions from two friends of mine
00:11:48 —longtime hardworking supporters
00:11:52 of the faithful slave for decades.
00:11:56 I love these men, and we’ll keep it anonymous.
00:11:59 But I asked them to write their personal feelings
00:12:04 because, you know, they’ve been supporting the slave for all these decades.
00:12:10 How have they benefited
00:12:12 from keeping on the watch?
00:12:16 So here’s what the first one said:
00:12:21 “I come from a long line of people
00:12:24 “who believed in keeping in expectation of the end.
00:12:28 “My mother died just last year,
00:12:32 “and she always felt that the end was close at hand.
00:12:36 “She just knew that she would live to see it,
00:12:40 “but she didn’t.
00:12:43 “She had first learned the truth from her mother-in-law, my grandmother,
00:12:47 “an anointed Christian who often told me
00:12:49 “that she hoped to see the end come in her lifetime.
00:12:53 “She didn’t.
00:12:55 “She had learned the truth from her mother, who died when I was a teenager
00:13:00 “and firmly believed she would see the end in her lifetime.
00:13:04 “She didn’t.
00:13:06 “And she, my great-grandmother,
00:13:08 “had learned the truth from her mother-in-law
00:13:10 “who died long before I was born
00:13:13 “and surely felt the same way about seeing the end.
00:13:16 “She didn’t.
00:13:19 “And here I am now on my seventh decade of life,
00:13:23 “firmly believing that I will see the end very soon.
00:13:29 “So, what does that mean?
00:13:32 “That I’m just another one in a long line of delusional people?
00:13:38 “I don’t think so for two reasons.
00:13:42 “One, the evidence that the end is near keeps growing.
00:13:46 “I’ve seen signs of the end that even my mother never saw,
00:13:51 “such as the recent pandemic.
00:13:53 “Sometimes I compare myself to a man living in Judea
00:13:57 “around the year 608 B.C.E.
00:14:00 “Such a man might have come from a long line of faithful people
00:14:05 “who had listened to the prophets and thought that the end was near.
00:14:09 “Over a century earlier,
00:14:13 “hearing these things
00:14:15 “(and maybe his great-grandparents might have heard Isaiah speak)
00:14:19 “led them to conclude that Jerusalem’s end was near.
00:14:24 “Should that man decide that his family had been deluded
00:14:29 “just because they hadn’t seen the destruction of Jerusalem?
00:14:33 “No.
00:14:35 Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.”
00:14:38 So, see, he’s living in 608 B.C.E. having these concerns.
00:14:44 Months later, it happens.
00:14:48 “But more importantly, that man would know
00:14:51 “that his faithful family were good people who lived good lives.
00:14:55 “They loved Jehovah, and they saw the truth of Isaiah’s words.
00:15:01 “God teaches us to benefit ourselves.
00:15:05 “And that’s the second reason why I don’t feel that I’ve been deluded
00:15:10 “or that my faithful family members have been.
00:15:13 “Each one who served Jehovah led a good, productive, useful life.
00:15:18 “They were not just sitting around waiting for the end.
00:15:22 “They always had projects that kept them busy in Jehovah’s service
00:15:26 “—goals and personal study and preaching and helping others.
00:15:30 “So they were full of purpose and joy.
00:15:33 “I want the same kind of life.
00:15:36 “Also, I can hardly wait to tell my mother [this is touching]
00:15:41 “just how close the end was
00:15:43 “when she finally closed her eyes.
00:15:46 I know she will want to hear all about it.”
00:15:52 See, very touching.
00:15:54 And now the second brother relates
00:15:56 how keeping on the watch has benefited him.
00:16:00 “My mom raised my brother and me in the truth.
00:16:04 “She often expressed to us her confidence
00:16:07 “that the end is just around the corner.
00:16:11 “She didn’t just say it, but she lived it.
00:16:14 “She devoted herself to the ministry
00:16:16 “so that she could help others to serve Jehovah
00:16:19 “while there is still time.
00:16:22 “She kept in expectation of the end,
00:16:25 “doing so year after year
00:16:28 “until she died.
00:16:30 “Now I’m approaching the age of my mother when she died.
00:16:34 “I’ve been keeping on the watch for over 50 years now.
00:16:38 “Am I bitter because the end has not yet come?
00:16:41 “No, not at all.
00:16:44 “How could I be?
00:16:46 “I’ve lived a full and satisfying life
00:16:49 “by living according to Jehovah’s standards.
00:16:52 “Why would I want to live any other way?
00:16:56 “What has helped me to keep positive while waiting for the end to come?
00:17:00 “From time to time, I reflect on these few things [and here they are]:
00:17:05 “My dedication is unconditional and unending.
00:17:10 “I did not dedicate myself to Jehovah
00:17:12 “on the condition that he brings the end within my lifetime
00:17:17 “or even on the condition that he gives me a reward.
00:17:20 “I dedicated myself to him forever.
00:17:25 “And next, I must keep the big picture in mind.
00:17:29 “I don’t want to make the mistake of focusing
00:17:32 “only on what the end will mean for me
00:17:36 “—the prospect of surviving into the new world.
00:17:40 “Rather, I must focus on something far more important
00:17:44 “—what the end will mean for Jehovah
00:17:47 “and the sanctification of his name.
00:17:50 “Knowing how important that is to him,
00:17:53 “I can be sure that it will happen
00:17:57 in his due time.”
00:17:59 And then finally:
00:18:01 “Meanwhile, I must endure to the end.
00:18:04 “That means to the end of this system or to the end of my life,
00:18:09 “whichever comes first.
00:18:11 “Either way, the older I get, the closer I am to the end.
00:18:16 “What if, like my mom, I don’t live to see it?
00:18:20 “No worries.
00:18:24 “The moment I close my eyes in death,
00:18:27 “my next conscious thought will be
00:18:30 “opening my eyes in the new world.
00:18:34 “Then it really won’t matter
00:18:37 whether I live to see the end or not.”
00:18:41 Beautiful expressions
00:18:43 of two beautiful spiritual men.
00:18:47 So the question to conclude is,
00:18:51 Will this be the last annual meeting
00:18:56 before the great tribulation?
00:19:01 Nobody raised their hand.
00:19:04 We don’t know.
00:19:06 But what we do know
00:19:09 is that Jehovah and Jesus want us
00:19:12 to keep on the watch.
00:19:17 And it’s for our own good to do so.

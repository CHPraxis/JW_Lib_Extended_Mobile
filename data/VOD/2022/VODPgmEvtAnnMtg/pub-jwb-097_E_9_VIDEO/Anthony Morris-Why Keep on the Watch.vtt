00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to answer the question,

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:07.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why keep on the watch?

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a simple, direct answer.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:12.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have a second reason as well

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share during this talk.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Find Mark,

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:22.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:25.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 13.

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it leads to our main reason why,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the context will really help us

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 32.

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that:
“Concerning that day or the hour

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:43.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nobody knows,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither the angels in heaven nor the Son,
but the Father.

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep looking, keep awake,

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:55.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you do not know
when the appointed time is.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is like a man traveling abroad
who left his house

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:02.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and gave the authority to his slaves,
to each one his work,

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:06.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and commanded the doorkeeper
to keep on the watch.

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:09.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on the watch, therefore,

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you do not know
when the master of the house is coming,

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether late in the day or at midnight

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or [at] dawn or early in the morning,

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order that when he comes suddenly,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:28.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
he does not find you sleeping.”

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s our Lord and Master

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
—very direct.

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:37.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s compassionate (true) but direct.

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:42.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the main reason why—verse 37:

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What I say to you, I say to all

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so it’s being repeated
to all of us listening]:

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:54.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep on the watch.”

00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very simple, very direct.

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:00.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what is expected.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, and I appreciated—

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hadn’t heard Brother Cook’s talk

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
(knew about the details and such),

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:13.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he emphasized for all of us,
and it’s connected here,

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:17.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah as a God of comfort.

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:22.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while it’s true that we want
to sometimes address directly

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things that Jesus has taught us,

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:28.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t mean that Jehovah is

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer a God of comfort.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:34.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to comfort us.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is the second reason.

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ll find Isaiah,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to read in chapter 48.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a very fine thought

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:50.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
about why keep on the watch.

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 17—very familiar to us—

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see the point:

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:01.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Holy One of Israel:

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:09.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.’”

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:18.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how we appreciate the footnote

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:23.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
that adds depth
to what Jehovah is saying here:

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:27.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or ‘for your own good’”!

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that priceless?

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why keep on the watch?

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s for our own good.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really is.

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the point
Jesus and Jehovah want us to take away.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re trying to address that with this talk

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:50.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
because some of you
have been serving Jehovah

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a long time.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m not going to stare at anybody

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I know different ones,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s just amazing how Jehovah

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:06.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been there for you all these years.

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re only human.

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll address some concerns
that some raise.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:16.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just want to have you
think about this here

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a personal experience.

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:22.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many years ago, my sons, Jesse and Paul,

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in the early years of school

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
—elementary school.

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And back at the time—
I haven’t heard it a lot lately,

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:36.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
but from time to time,
this would come up at a social gathering.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, mind you, they’re

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:41.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
in second grade and first grade,

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:45.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
but these boys were thinkers.

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’d listen,
and they appreciated all these older ones.

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a number of them in Rhode Island

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
—longtime servants of Jehovah God.

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, from time to time—this statement—

00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:00.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’d be looking at my sons and say:

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, you’ll never graduate in this system.

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not going to happen.”

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:12.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you know, I’m at their house;
they just fed us.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord, help me.
What am I going to do here?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this would come up from time to time,
at least during those years.

00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe it was post-1975.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they’d make these statements.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m going to give you a big confession

00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, you know,
this one comes clear to mind.

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Driving back from the gathering,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesse and Paul are, you know,
thinking and they’re troubled.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re puzzled.
What is this about?

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:46.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because, you know, they had goals.

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:47.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What are we going to do?”

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:51.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re thinking
of the things in the future for them

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they’re growing in their love for Jehovah.

00:05:55.838 --> 00:05:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is that true, Dad?”

00:05:58.374 --> 00:06:00.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I’d say, “Look . . .”

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let me tell you,
these people saying these things

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:06.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
were longtime servants—experienced people.

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:10.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
If any of you are guilty, God loves you.
He forgives you.

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did that back then,
you didn’t help anybody.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m going to give you a big confession.

00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:21.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that one particular night,
we’re driving back

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:24.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was a little distance from where we were—

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they brought that up.

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re sitting in the back seat,
and we’re having this conversation.

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:34.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I told them—I said:
“Look, you boys remember,

00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you got to keep on the watch.

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:43.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
This thing could go on,
and be ready for it to go to 2020.”

00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:47.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honest.

00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:52.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we’re talking almost 40 years
—almost 40 years.

00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt pretty safe with that.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:00.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know what year this is.

00:07:00.736 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to do?

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at least I’m happy to say

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:10.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they and my wife and their wives

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all still keeping on the watch.

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been and plan to continue

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep on the watch.

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:23.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is just something to address

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the feelings that some have.

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these are beautiful friends

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:34.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
—different ones worshipping Jehovah
for many decades.

00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re only human.

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the truth,

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:42.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’re only human.

00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one brother wrote,

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:47.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I appreciated his sincerity.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During the annual meeting of 2019,

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Ramapo project was announced.

00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And if I remember right,

00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was stated that the project
would be complete in a few years.

00:08:04.133 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With recent <i>Watchtower</i>  articles telling us

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:11.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we are in ‘the last of “the last days”’

00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:15.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[beautiful expression,
but words are powerful],

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it seemed a little disappointing

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this may push
Armageddon off a few years.”

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was his sincere concern—really.

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know he’s not alone.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re only human.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how should we respond?

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother wrote that in.

00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:43.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember, Jehovah is a God of comfort.

00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:45.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to go direct.

00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:48.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what we addressed there
with what Jesus told us.

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:53.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we comfort him too?

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bring the truth as it is,
and be straight with it.

00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:04.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body wants all of you to know

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:07.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
(including those that will see it later)

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:11.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are determined to remain active

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to faithfully deliver spiritual food

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:18.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right time.

00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also looking beyond the last days.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re getting that message.

00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me expound on that thought:

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking beyond the last days.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:35.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a quote from the <i>Proclaimers</i>  book.

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:38.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
I treasured it when the book came out,

00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:41.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a lot of work went into that publication.

00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:46.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there, referring to God’s people,
it stated—

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, there was
a lot of international construction

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:53.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
going on at the time too,
if you were in the truth then.

00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m quoting it now:
“With the help of Jehovah’s spirit,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they [God’s people] want to give
the greatest witness possible

00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“during the time that remains
before Armageddon.

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:08.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are convinced

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that God’s new world is very close at hand,

00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they have faith

00:10:14.063 --> 00:10:18.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that they will survive
as an organized people

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into that new world, under the rule

00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s Messianic Kingdom.”

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:27.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, please note the rest of this quote:

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is also their hope that perhaps

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[key word]

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“many of the fine facilities
that they have built

00:10:38.354 --> 00:10:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and dedicated to Jehovah

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:44.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will continue to be used after Armageddon

00:10:44.493 --> 00:10:48.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as centers from which knowledge
of the only true God

00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:53.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be diffused
until it truly fills the earth.”

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful thought.

00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:59.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s right there—still valid.

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:04.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in harmony
with what the faithful slave said then,

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:07.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
the faithful slave now says

00:11:07.116 --> 00:11:11.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
that many of the projects
that are being worked on now

00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:16.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like Ramapo, the <i>Good News</i>
<i>According to Jesus  </i>video series—

00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:20.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
may or perhaps

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
will carry over into the new world

00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:29.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assist the great crowd with the work ahead

00:11:29.905 --> 00:11:31.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps

00:11:31.907 --> 00:11:34.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
include resurrected ones.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s comforting.

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:41.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to let that sink in.

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we want to conclude

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
with expressions from two friends of mine

00:11:48.724 --> 00:11:52.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
—longtime hardworking supporters

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the faithful slave for decades.

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:59.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love these men,
and we’ll keep it anonymous.

00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:04.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I asked them
to write their personal feelings

00:12:04.106 --> 00:12:09.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, you know, they’ve been supporting
the slave for all these decades.

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:12.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have they benefited

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:16.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
from keeping on the watch?

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:19.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s what the first one said:

00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I come from a long line of people

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who believed in keeping in expectation
of the end.

00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My mother died just last year,

00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:36.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and she always felt that the end
was close at hand.

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She just knew that she would live to see it,

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:43.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but she didn’t.

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She had first learned the truth
from her mother-in-law, my grandmother,

00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:49.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an anointed Christian who often told me

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:53.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that she hoped to see the end
come in her lifetime.

00:12:53.756 --> 00:12:55.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t.

00:12:55.791 --> 00:13:00.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She had learned the truth from her mother,
who died when I was a teenager

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:04.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and firmly believed
she would see the end in her lifetime.

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:06.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t.

00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:08.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And she, my great-grandmother,

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:10.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“had learned the truth from her mother-in-law

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who died long before I was born

00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:16.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and surely felt the same way
about seeing the end.

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:19.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t.

00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:23.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And here I am now
on my seventh decade of life,

00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:27.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“firmly believing
that I will see the end very soon.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, what does that mean?

00:13:32.294 --> 00:13:36.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That I’m just another one
in a long line of delusional people?

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:42.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t think so for two reasons.

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One, the evidence that the end is near
keeps growing.

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:51.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve seen signs of the end
that even my mother never saw,

00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“such as the recent pandemic.

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sometimes I compare myself
to a man living in Judea

00:13:57.486 --> 00:14:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“around the year 608 B.C.E.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such a man might have come
from a long line of faithful people

00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:09.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who had listened to the prophets
and thought that the end was near.

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:13.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Over a century earlier,

00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“hearing these things

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:19.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(and maybe his great-grandparents
might have heard Isaiah speak)

00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“led them to conclude
that Jerusalem’s end was near.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:29.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Should that man decide
that his family had been deluded

00:14:29.218 --> 00:14:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just because they hadn’t seen
the destruction of Jerusalem?

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:38.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.”

00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:43.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, see, he’s living in 608 B.C.E.
having these concerns.

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Months later, it happens.

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But more importantly, that man would know

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:55.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that his faithful family were good people
who lived good lives.

00:14:55.711 --> 00:15:00.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They loved Jehovah,
and they saw the truth of Isaiah’s words.

00:15:01.684 --> 00:15:04.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God teaches us to benefit ourselves.

00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:10.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And that’s the second reason
why I don’t feel that I’ve been deluded

00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:13.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or that my faithful family members
have been.

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Each one who served Jehovah
led a good, productive, useful life.

00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They were not just sitting around
waiting for the end.

00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:26.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They always had projects
that kept them busy in Jehovah’s service

00:15:26.141 --> 00:15:30.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—goals and personal study
and preaching and helping others.

00:15:30.212 --> 00:15:33.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they were full of purpose and joy.

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:36.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I want the same kind of life.

00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:41.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, I can hardly wait to tell my mother
[this is touching]

00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:43.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just how close the end was

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:46.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when she finally closed her eyes.

00:15:46.962 --> 00:15:51.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know she will want to hear all about it.”

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:54.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, very touching.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now the second brother relates

00:15:56.905 --> 00:16:00.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
how keeping on the watch has benefited him.

00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:04.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My mom raised
my brother and me in the truth.

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:07.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She often expressed to us her confidence

00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:10.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the end is just around the corner.

00:16:11.587 --> 00:16:14.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t just say it, but she lived it.

00:16:14.523 --> 00:16:16.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She devoted herself to the ministry

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:19.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that she could help others
to serve Jehovah

00:16:19.928 --> 00:16:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“while there is still time.

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:25.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She kept in expectation of the end,

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“doing so year after year

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until she died.

00:16:30.439 --> 00:16:34.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I’m approaching
the age of my mother when she died.

00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:38.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve been keeping on the watch
for over 50 years now.

00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Am I bitter because the end
has not yet come?

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No, not at all.

00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:46.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How could I be?

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve lived a full and satisfying life

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:52.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by living according to Jehovah’s standards.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:56.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why would I want to live any other way?

00:16:56.432 --> 00:17:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What has helped me to keep positive
while waiting for the end to come?

00:17:00.969 --> 00:17:05.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From time to time, I reflect
on these few things [and here they are]:

00:17:05.007 --> 00:17:10.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My dedication is unconditional and unending.

00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:12.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I did not dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:17.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the condition that he brings the end
within my lifetime

00:17:17.219 --> 00:17:20.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or even on the condition
that he gives me a reward.

00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:25.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I dedicated myself to him forever.

00:17:25.194 --> 00:17:29.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And next, I must keep
the big picture in mind.

00:17:29.398 --> 00:17:32.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t want to make the mistake of focusing

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:36.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“only on what the end will mean for me

00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the prospect of surviving
into the new world.

00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:44.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, I must focus
on something far more important

00:17:44.613 --> 00:17:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—what the end will mean for Jehovah

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the sanctification of his name.

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Knowing how important that is to him,

00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:57.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can be sure that it will happen

00:17:57.426 --> 00:17:59.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his due time.”

00:17:59.428 --> 00:18:01.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally:

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meanwhile, I must endure to the end.

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:09.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That means to the end of this system
or to the end of my life,

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whichever comes first.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Either way, the older I get,
the closer I am to the end.

00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:20.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What if, like my mom,
I don’t live to see it?

00:18:20.482 --> 00:18:22.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No worries.

00:18:24.052 --> 00:18:27.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The moment I close my eyes in death,

00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my next conscious thought will be

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“opening my eyes in the new world.

00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:37.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then it really won’t matter

00:18:37.566 --> 00:18:41.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether I live to see the end or not.”

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful expressions

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:47.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
of two beautiful spiritual men.

00:18:47.743 --> 00:18:51.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question to conclude is,

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:55.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will this be the last annual meeting

00:18:56.952 --> 00:18:58.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the great tribulation?

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:03.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody raised their hand.

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:06.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know.

00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:09.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what we do know

00:19:09.198 --> 00:19:12.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that Jehovah and Jesus want us

00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:17.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep on the watch.

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:21.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s for our own good to do so.

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what time it is?

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us are conscious of time every day.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a time to go to work,
a time to go to school, a time to eat,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a time for our Christian meetings,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:19.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even a time for association

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our dear friends.

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Great Timekeeper,

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:28.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah reminds us at Ecclesiastes 3:1

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is a proper “time for everything.”

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thus, it’s not surprising
that the Bible speaks

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the right time for various events.

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:43.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Leviticus 26:4,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised the obedient Israelites

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:51.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would bless them
with “showers of rain at [the] proper time.”

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s just a detail, probably,
for most of us.

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’ve ever lived
in a farming community

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you’ve done farming yourself,

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that rain at the right time

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can give you a bumper crop,

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rain at the wrong time

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can completely destroy that same crop.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:16.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even words can be spoken at the right time.

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 15:23 says:

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A word spoken at the right time

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how good it is!”

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, it is a fundamental principle

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:31.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that timing is everything.

00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think for a moment
about prophesied events

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that took place right on time.

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:42.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was baptized at precisely the time

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Messiah was prophesied to appear.

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom began its heavenly rule

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on time in 1914.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking to the future, Jesus said

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has set the time,

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the exact day and the hour,

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the end of this wicked system of things.

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:09.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the Governing Body know

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:11.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Armageddon is going to come?

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we do.

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to come right on time.

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have full confidence in that
—don’t we?—

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is going to bring about
those earth-shaking events

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:30.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly on time.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:34.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is something else
that Jehovah has promised

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide at the proper time.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:38.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you go to your Bibles?

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:42.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Matthew chapter 24

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 45.

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here Jesus posed this question:

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:55.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who really is
the faithful and discreet slave

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:58.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whom his master appointed
over his domestics,

00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give them their food

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the proper time?

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is that slave if his master

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on coming finds him doing so!

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Truly I say to you, he will appoint him

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over all his belongings.”

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:19.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus say here?

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:23.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he would appoint
a “faithful and discreet slave”

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would provide the spiritual food.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is another important detail there
—did you notice it?

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He added “at the proper time.”

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because of Jehovah’s
perfect sense of time,

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knows exactly what his people need

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:48.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knows exactly the right time
to provide it.

00:03:48.378 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just consider
 a couple of examples of this.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as World War II was erupting,

00:03:56.152 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the November 1, 1939, issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
featured an in-depth discussion

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the topic of neutrality.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:10.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That timing was absolutely perfect.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of those articles,

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers worldwide

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew exactly what to do

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the war engulfed the entire planet.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after the war
as the organization was rapidly growing,

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization arranged

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
large international conventions

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were held in New York City.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:41.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1958, a quarter of a million people
—can you imagine?—

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overflowed Yankee Stadium
and the Polo Grounds.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were any of you there?

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s so wonderful that we still have
a few people who were there.

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:56.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that I wasn’t
in the truth at that time;

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just that I wasn’t
in the world at that time.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that amazing convention

00:05:04.754 --> 00:05:07.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came just on time.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It energized God’s people
and, we could say,

00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it put Jehovah’s Witnesses on the map.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to ignore a convention

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a quarter of a million people.

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, fast forward to 2020

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when the world was engulfed

00:05:30.013 --> 00:05:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a global pandemic.

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:35.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Large gatherings were prohibited
in most countries.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we go to Yankee Stadium and have

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
250,000 people there?

00:05:41.157 --> 00:05:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:44.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right on time,

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah guided
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that our worldwide brotherhood

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:54.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could enjoy the convention program from home

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:57.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—truly, spiritual “food

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the proper time.”

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the pandemic, we’ve had
to change our methods, haven’t we?

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had to receive direction
about how to carry out our preaching work

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:12.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to carry out
our congregation meetings.

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But throughout this period, we have received

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:17.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
powerful, powerful evidence

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has given this direction to us
at the proper time.

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let me just give you
a couple of examples.

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:32.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the 2021 service year,

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least 22 branches

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reported an all-time peak
in the number of publishers.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine—during the pandemic?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the Korea branch

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has reported a new peak in publishers

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:55.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every month during the 2021 service year.

00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:58.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that amazing—during a pandemic?

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with so many wonderful things
happening in the field,

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:11.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that you’re all wondering

00:07:11.914 --> 00:07:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our worldwide Memorial attendance

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 2021.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by the undeserved kindness

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our amazing God, Jehovah,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have reached an all-time peak,

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:33.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
crossing the 21 million mark.

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know the exact figure?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “keep on the watch”!

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:45.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be announced today at the proper time.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today in our program,

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:53.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are going to have a wonderful buffet

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of rich spiritual food
of many varieties and types.

00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by the end of the program,
I’m sure that you’ll agree

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was just what we needed

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at this moment in time.

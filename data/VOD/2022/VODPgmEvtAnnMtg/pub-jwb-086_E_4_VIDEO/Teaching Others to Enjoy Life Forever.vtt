How thrilled we were

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.116 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at last year’s annual meeting

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.243 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to receive a new publication:

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course </i>!

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already many publishers are having success

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in conducting progressive studies
using this new tool.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you listen to experiences
from around the world,

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.348 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When they made the announcement

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:37.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the new publication,

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.269 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for me it was just pure excitement.

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.937 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I was so overjoyed

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:43.981 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I kept going to the website

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.774 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
around the time of the release,

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at times I would even refresh my browser

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few times a day to see when it was out.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:52.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Having all the teaching methods

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:53.991 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
right in our hands

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—what more can we ask for?

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:59.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were so excited that during this pandemic,

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:00.998 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us something

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:02.875 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to energize our ministry.

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you heard that we would be using
a new method for conducting studies,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were you a bit hesitant?

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay close attention
to what experienced teachers are saying

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the benefits of this approach.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.601 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before, it wasn’t uncommon

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.645 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to hear students start their comments

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:25.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with expressions like “the paragraph says”

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “as the book mentions.”

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s not like that.

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:30.027 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the old way of teaching,

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:32.404 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was a bit difficult for me to discern

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:34.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
if my Bible students really understood

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they were learning
or if the truth reached their hearts.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think I was using

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:41.622 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
too many additional points

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to convey one idea

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.959 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and just explaining too much,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my Bible students
would get even more confused.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With some well-educated people,

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:53.801 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the studies were in a sense

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.552 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
too easy for them.

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They found the answer very easily
from the paragraph

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were able to answer correctly,

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was very hard to know
what they really thought about the matter.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this new book,

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems like it is easier to see

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the person’s genuine thoughts on the matter.

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.407 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the previous method,

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.409 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you would see the student

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.869 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
looking at the book a lot,

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that doesn’t happen now.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at the student,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can tell he is thinking about the answer

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of looking for the answer.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They used to enjoy
the Bible study in the past,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now they enjoy it much more.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they are able to keep focused

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the beginning to the end of our session.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel motivated and closer to Jehovah.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:52.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach the heart of a Bible student,

00:02:52.943 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to understand
what he’s thinking and feeling.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book
help us to do that?

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things I love about it

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is how after we read the Bible verse,

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are the questions that follow it

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are perfectly phrased for us.

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really engages our students’ hearts,

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps them to understand

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:16.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible teachings right away,

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps us to see
what’s in their heart as well.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.472 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It lets the student express

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:23.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what is in his heart,

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:25.559 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which allows us to help him.

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:27.603 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first time I looked

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:28.979 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
through this publication,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I could already see

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:32.316 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how appealing its format is.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no lengthy paragraphs,

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is prepared in a very interactive way.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With this new method, I definitely talk less.

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:43.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My students talk more.

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the one that starts it all off

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the introduction video—

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:50.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just makes everything fit together.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the amazing things

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:55.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it introduces right away is the prayer,

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because often as a teacher,
we didn’t know exactly

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:01.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when to introduce prayer or how to do it,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the video does it for us.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, teachers are excited
about the new book.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what impact
is it having on their students?

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:27.246 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Bible students

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:29.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have been pleasantly surprised.

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I asked one student how he felt

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:34.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be using this new publication.

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:36.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the response was:

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:38.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why didn’t we do this sooner?

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:41.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s great!
I’m a lot calmer.”

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another student
told me that she was relieved

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to no longer have to find the answers

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, to express
her thoughts and feelings.

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our discussion

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:53.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “Dig Deeper” section in lesson 02,

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:55.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Bible student really appreciated

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:58.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scriptures and the beautiful artwork.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:02.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he
could already see himself in Paradise

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoying the many promises of Jehovah.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that our discussion

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:10.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made him feel Jehovah’s love.

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:12.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With the students,

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:14.418 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they’re not so overwhelmed with the new book

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:16.461 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when we ask them to prepare the lesson.

00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:18.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the <i>Bible Teach</i>  book,
when we would ask them

00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare these paragraphs,

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was like you asked them
to go to the dentist.

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just seemed so intimidated by it.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now they smile, and they’re like,
“OK, I can do that.”

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:31.393 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One student in particular

00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:33.478 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wrote in the “Goal” box:

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:35.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“I want to share the points

00:05:35.147 --> 00:05:36.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from this lesson

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my friends and work colleagues
within a week.”

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:40.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the videos that was really effective

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:45.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the one from lesson 04,

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:47.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>My Search for the True God</i>.

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows the experience
of Sister Soten Yoeun.

00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:53.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My students were deeply moved.

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really felt Jehovah’s love for them

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:58.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to speak with him.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They felt motivated to pray.

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were studying the first lesson
with an 83-year-old lady

00:06:06.053 --> 00:06:09.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we came across Matthew 7:7.

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:14.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She read it in her own Bible,

00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at first she didn’t quite understand it.

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we pondered over the verse
together with the question.

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:25.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then all of a sudden she asked:

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:28.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh! Does this verse mean

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:30.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I should dig
for the answers in the Bible myself

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:34.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of asking a priest?”

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:36.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was quite a special moment.

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:38.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The video

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.171 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
under “Learn to enjoy Bible reading”

00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:43.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was very helpful for one young man.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After watching it,

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:48.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he set the goal
of reading the Bible every day.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With one Bible student,

00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:53.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had encouraged him
to become an unbaptized publisher

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:56.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the previous study book.

00:06:56.395 --> 00:07:00.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now when we were in lesson 02
of our new study publication,

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:04.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he expressed the desire
to become an unbaptized publisher

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:09.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he felt he could share
one or two points from each lesson

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:12.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his friends and others that he knew.

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:15.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so now he is approved,
and he’s doing very well in the ministry.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to this new book,
I now conduct 15 Bible studies.

00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:24.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book helps them to maintain
the desire and motivation

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep learning about Jehovah,

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his beautiful qualities,
and the future that awaits us.

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:35.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly,
our worldwide brotherhood is excited

00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:38.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:41.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a tremendous gift from Jehovah!

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:43.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of all the facets of our ministry,

00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:45.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without question

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conducting a progressive Bible study

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:50.782 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is the most satisfying aspect.

00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:52.409 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And now we have the tool

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.411 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the method to make it much easier.

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:56.621 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m very grateful for this tool.

00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:59.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It really helps us to sense

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.168 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how close the Governing Body

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:03.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizes we are to the end,

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:06.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it in no way feels like a rushed program.

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heart is definitely
being reached gently and lovingly,

00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:13.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then that is what motivates quickly.

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:14.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try and introduce it as much as you can.

00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:17.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Start those Bible studies.

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:18.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you do,

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please invite me
to join in on your new Bible study.

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new book <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:37.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows clearly
that “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:41.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been, is, and will continue to give

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:44.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly what we need
at exactly the right time.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:48.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This publication has the potential

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help many more honesthearted ones

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:54.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to know and love
our wonderful Father, Jehovah.

00:08:54.763 --> 00:08:58.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May he bless you and your Bible students

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:00.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you put to use this new tool.

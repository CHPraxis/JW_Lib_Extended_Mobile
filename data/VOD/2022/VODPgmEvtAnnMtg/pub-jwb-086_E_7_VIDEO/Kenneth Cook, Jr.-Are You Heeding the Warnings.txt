00:00:01 We live in a time that will end in final judgment
00:00:06 by means of God’s Kingdom.
00:00:08 Jesus described this time
00:00:10 when he gave his disciples a prophetic sign
00:00:14 regarding his invisible presence
00:00:16 at “the conclusion of the system of things.”
00:00:19 Since his prophecy applies to our day,
00:00:22 we should be very interested in its details.
00:00:27 It also points to a bright future
00:00:29 for those who heed its warnings.
00:00:32 We find the prophecy
00:00:34 in Matthew chapters 24 and 25,
00:00:37 Mark chapter 13,
00:00:39 and Luke chapter 21.
00:00:42 After revealing many of the things
00:00:45 that would occur, Jesus provided warnings
00:00:48 for his disciples by means of three parables.
00:00:52 First, he gave the parable of the virgins,
00:00:56 then the parable of the talents,
00:00:59 and finally the parable
00:01:02 of the sheep and the goats.
00:01:05 The parables show how a person’s behavior
00:01:08 will affect his or her final judgment.
00:01:12 The two parables apply to those
00:01:14 (the first two) with the heavenly hope,
00:01:17 and the third parable applies
00:01:19 to those with an earthly hope.
00:01:22 Yet no matter what our hope may be,
00:01:25 all of us can learn from the warnings
00:01:28 found in Jesus’ parables.
00:01:30 Let’s start with the third parable.
00:01:34 In the parable of the sheep and the goats,
00:01:37 Jesus described the final judgment
00:01:40 for sheeplike ones and goatlike ones
00:01:42 during the great tribulation.
00:01:45 As Jehovah’s appointed Judge and King,
00:01:48 Jesus will be completely righteous
00:01:50 in the judgment that he gives.
00:01:53 As a thorough Judge,
00:01:55 he is already observing the actions, attitudes,
00:01:59 and speech of all people,
00:02:01 including how they treat his anointed brothers.
00:02:06 By the start of the great tribulation,
00:02:08 Jesus will have identified those
00:02:11 who are sheeplike or goatlike in their conduct and attitude.
00:02:15 From that time onward,
00:02:17 those who are goatlike will not seek to change.
00:02:21 However, those who are sheeplike
00:02:23 and who have the hope of living forever on earth
00:02:27 will need to remain faithful in order for Jehovah
00:02:30 to keep their names “in the book of life.”
00:02:35 Then, just before Armageddon,
00:02:37 God’s Son will pass final judgment
00:02:40 on all of those then living here on earth.
00:02:43 Persons who are judged to be righteous
00:02:46 will enter into everlasting life on earth.
00:02:49 What a marvelous reward
00:02:51 for those who keep their integrity!
00:02:55 Although Jesus’ third parable
00:02:57 applies to those who hope to live on the earth,
00:02:59 anointed ones too must listen
00:03:02 to the warning message found in that parable.
00:03:05 How so?
00:03:07 Because Jesus is observing their actions,
00:03:10 attitudes, and speech as well.
00:03:13 They too must prove to be righteous and faithful.
00:03:17 Still, a few questions remain.
00:03:21 For example, how are anointed Christians
00:03:23 undergoing a period of judgment today?
00:03:26 And what warnings did Jesus provide for them?
00:03:30 We find the answers to both questions
00:03:33 in the first two parables of Matthew chapter 25.
00:03:38 To prepare us for this review,
00:03:41 let’s briefly consider how anointed Christians are chosen.
00:03:45 We’ll start by looking at a lesson from ancient times.
00:03:50 When the priesthood was established in ancient Israel,
00:03:54 Jehovah decided who would serve as high priest
00:03:58 as well as the underpriests at the tabernacle.
00:04:01 Exodus 28:1 tells us
00:04:04 that he selected “Aaron, along with his sons.”
00:04:08 No one could rightly question Jehovah’s choice,
00:04:12 and those chosen had to prove worthy of their calling.
00:04:16 Similar to what he did back then,
00:04:19 Jehovah chooses those who will serve as priests in heaven.
00:04:24 He began by selecting Jesus
00:04:27 to serve as High Priest.
00:04:29 Although Jesus was a perfect man,
00:04:32 he did not choose that role for himself.
00:04:36 We read at Hebrews 5:5
00:04:39 that “the Christ did not glorify himself
00:04:42 by becoming a high priest.”
00:04:45 Likewise, those who will serve as priests in heaven
00:04:50 do not choose themselves for this assignment.
00:04:53 They are selected by Jehovah
00:04:56 and anointed with his holy spirit.
00:04:59 He knows each one whom he has anointed for this service.
00:05:03 How do faithful anointed ones view their heavenly calling?
00:05:09 When a person is anointed by God,
00:05:12 he or she knows without a doubt that it is from Jehovah
00:05:16 and that one accepts Jehovah’s choice with gratitude.
00:05:21 Instead of feeling proud or haughty,
00:05:24 anointed ones strive
00:05:26 to imitate Jesus’ example of humility.
00:05:30 They’re helped to do so by keeping in mind
00:05:33 the lessons and warnings
00:05:35 that are found in Jesus’ parables for them.
00:05:39 It’s noteworthy that just before relating his parables,
00:05:44 Jesus spoke about a “faithful and discreet slave”
00:05:48 who would distribute spiritual food
00:05:50 at the proper time during the last days.
00:05:54 That slave pictures a small group
00:05:57 of anointed Christian men today, the Governing Body.
00:06:01 For their faithful service, Jesus said
00:06:03 that there would be a reward, but he also provided a warning.
00:06:08 He spoke about what would happen
00:06:11 if that slave ever lost sight of Jesus’ future return
00:06:15 and started to mistreat his fellow slaves.
00:06:18 If that were to happen,
00:06:20 that slave would be viewed as evil and would,
00:06:24 as Matthew 24:51 states,
00:06:27 be ‘punished with the greatest severity.’
00:06:31 Please note that Jesus was not prophesying
00:06:35 that there would be an evil slave.
00:06:38 This is a warning, not a prophecy.
00:06:43 What was the warning?
00:06:45 That the faithful slave needs to remain watchful.
00:06:49 Yet, it is not just “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:06:52 who must remain watchful.
00:06:54 By means of his parables, Jesus warned
00:06:57 that all anointed ones must likewise prove
00:07:00 to be discreet, faithful, and watchful.
00:07:05 Now, how did Jesus make his point?
00:07:09 In the parable of the virgins, Jesus spoke
00:07:13 of ten virgins who went out to meet a bridegroom.
00:07:16 They hoped to accompany the bridegroom into his marriage feast.
00:07:20 Jesus described five of the virgins
00:07:23 as discreet and five as foolish.
00:07:27 The Greek word used for “discreet”
00:07:30 conveys the idea of understanding,
00:07:33 forethought, discernment, and wisdom
00:07:36 in a practical sense.
00:07:39 So the discreet virgins were wise,
00:07:43 and they showed this by being ready
00:07:45 when the bridegroom arrived in the middle of the night.
00:07:48 They had lamps to light their way.
00:07:51 And Matthew 25:4 adds that “the discreet [virgins]
00:07:56 took oil in their flasks along with their lamps.”
00:08:00 So they had the means to keep their lamps burning.
00:08:05 Because they proved to be ready,
00:08:08 they could follow the bridegroom into his marriage feast.
00:08:12 This action depicts genuine anointed ones
00:08:15 entering into their heavenly reward.
00:08:18 They will be judged as worthy
00:08:20 to join the Bridegroom, Jesus, in his heavenly Kingdom.
00:08:25 But what about the foolish virgins?
00:08:28 Well, unlike the discreet virgins,
00:08:31 the foolish ones were not ready when the bridegroom arrived.
00:08:34 Their lamps died out.
00:08:36 As a result, they could not follow the bridegroom
00:08:39 and enter into his marriage feast.
00:08:42 When they later tried to do so,
00:08:45 they heard the bridegroom tell them:
00:08:48 “I do not know you.”
00:08:51 What is the lesson and warning
00:08:54 that Jesus was illustrating?
00:08:56 He was showing that only anointed Christians
00:08:59 who “keep on the watch” and prove to be ready
00:09:02 will follow him into the reward.
00:09:05 Notice, though, that Jesus did not say
00:09:08 that there would be a large number of foolish ones
00:09:11 who would be unprepared when he comes in this way
00:09:13 at the great tribulation.
00:09:16 Here, too, this is a warning, not a prophecy.
00:09:20 We’re not focused on five of them being discreet
00:09:23 and five of them being foolish.
00:09:26 Jesus was simply letting anointed ones know
00:09:29 what would happen if they failed to “keep on the watch.”
00:09:34 That is a sobering thought.
00:09:37 Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,
00:09:40 all true Christians should listen to the warning
00:09:44 found in the parable of the virgins.
00:09:47 We must “keep on the watch”
00:09:49 and always be ready
00:09:51 to carry out our service to God.
00:09:56 Now, after using the parable of the virgins
00:09:58 to emphasize the need to be discreet,
00:10:01 Jesus related a parable that highlights the need to be faithful.
00:10:06 It is the parable of the talents, or money.
00:10:10 In this parable, Jesus tells about two slaves
00:10:14 who were faithful to their master
00:10:16 and one slave who was not.
00:10:19 How did the two slaves prove to be faithful?
00:10:23 Well, the faithful slaves worked hard
00:10:25 to increase the money that their master entrusted to their care
00:10:28 just before he traveled abroad.
00:10:31 When he returned, the faithful slaves
00:10:34 had more to give back than what they had received
00:10:38 and they were blessed for doing so.
00:10:40 But what about the third slave, the sluggish one?
00:10:44 What did he do with what he had received?
00:10:48 Well, the sluggish slave buried what he had been given
00:10:51 and failed to increase his master’s talents.
00:10:54 When the master returned, that slave had nothing additional
00:10:58 to give to his master.
00:11:00 He even tried to blame the master,
00:11:02 calling him “a demanding man.”
00:11:04 As a result, that slave did not receive greater blessings.
00:11:09 More than that, what he had been given
00:11:13 was taken away from him,
00:11:15 and he was cast out of the master’s household.
00:11:19 What did the master’s response mean for each of his slaves,
00:11:24 and whom do they picture today?
00:11:28 The two faithful slaves depict anointed Christians
00:11:32 who proved to be valued members of the master’s household.
00:11:36 The Master, Jesus, invites them
00:11:39 to “enter into the joy of [their] master.”
00:11:42 That joy pictures their heavenly reward.
00:11:46 On the other hand, the bad example of the sluggish slave
00:11:51 provides a warning for anointed ones.
00:11:53 How so?
00:11:56 If anointed ones do not remain alert and watchful,
00:12:00 they could become self-satisfied with what they have received.
00:12:04 They might not extend themselves in Kingdom service.
00:12:08 They could lose sight of their responsibilities
00:12:11 and fail to do as 2 Peter 1:10 urges,
00:12:15 where they are told “to make the calling
00:12:17 and choosing sure for themselves.”
00:12:21 If any of them become like the sluggish slave,
00:12:24 they would not be approved to enter into the heavenly Kingdom
00:12:28 and share in the joy of the Master.
00:12:31 Once again,
00:12:33 Jesus was providing a warning, not a prophecy.
00:12:37 Clearly, all anointed Christians
00:12:40 must strive to be both discreet and faithful.
00:12:46 Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,
00:12:49 all true Christians are determined to remain faithful to Jehovah.
00:12:54 We are secure in our relationship with him.
00:12:58 We’re not concerned if Jehovah
00:13:00 chooses to anoint some faithful ones in more recent years.
00:13:04 We recall what Jesus said regarding the “11th-hour” workers
00:13:09 in his illustration about the vineyard.
00:13:11 You can read about it in Matthew chapter 20.
00:13:16 Those who were invited to work in the vineyard later in the day
00:13:20 received the same reward from the master of the vineyard
00:13:23 as those who were invited to work in it earlier in the day.
00:13:27 Likewise, Jehovah and his Son know how many anointed ones to call
00:13:32 in order to complete the number of 144,000
00:13:36 before the end comes.
00:13:39 But no matter when they are selected,
00:13:41 each anointed one who is judged to be faithful
00:13:45 will receive their heavenly reward.
00:13:48 Now with that in mind, let’s consider
00:13:50 Matthew 24:40, 41.
00:13:56 And as we do, we’ll see how these verses
00:13:58 connect to Jesus’ parables for the anointed.
00:14:02 At Matthew 24:40, it reads:
00:14:06 “Then two men will be in the field;
00:14:09 “one will be taken along and the other abandoned.
00:14:13 “Two women will be grinding at the hand mill;
00:14:16 one will be taken along and the other abandoned.”
00:14:22 Did you notice some similarities to the parables?
00:14:26 Jesus spoke of two men working in a field
00:14:29 and of two women working at a hand mill.
00:14:32 Outwardly, they appear to be the same.
00:14:36 But in each case, Jesus said that “one [would] be taken along
00:14:41 and the other abandoned.”
00:14:43 He then urged his followers to “keep on the watch, therefore,
00:14:48 because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.”
00:14:53 Jesus said something very similar
00:14:56 after relating the parable of the virgins.
00:14:59 In both examples, he provided a warning.
00:15:03 Since the parable of the virgins applies to anointed Christians,
00:15:08 do Jesus’ comments about those who are taken along
00:15:11 also apply to the anointed?
00:15:13 It appears that they do.
00:15:15 And here again, Jesus was providing a warning.
00:15:20 In his great prophecy regarding “the conclusion of the system of things,”
00:15:24 we find that Jesus lovingly highlights
00:15:27 both the good news of the Kingdom,
00:15:30 as well as warning messages for all people,
00:15:33 including his followers.
00:15:35 Down to this day, our message follows the same pattern.
00:15:40 It is both one of salvation as well as one of warning.
00:15:45 And we must continue to do all that we can
00:15:47 to deliver Jesus’ twofold message
00:15:50 and help others to act on it while there is still time.
00:15:54 Clearly, Jehovah and his Son want us
00:15:57 to remain discreet, faithful, and on the watch.
00:16:02 So, what have we considered?
00:16:06 Some of the virgins in Jesus’ illustration
00:16:09 found out that the door was shut,
00:16:11 and they heard the bridegroom tell them:
00:16:13 “I do not know you.”
00:16:15 One of the slaves in Jesus’ illustration of the talents
00:16:18 did not enter into his master’s joy
00:16:21 but was thrown outside into the darkness.
00:16:24 Jesus also indicated
00:16:27 that not all would be taken along into the heavenly reward.
00:16:32 What a serious warning for those who have the heavenly hope!
00:16:35 Even so, we are confident
00:16:38 that the full number of them will be filled.
00:16:42 Truly, this is a time of judgment for all of God’s people,
00:16:47 including the righteous sheep who yearn to live forever on earth.
00:16:51 But there is no reason for any of us
00:16:54 to fear the final judgment that is yet ahead.
00:16:58 Our loving heavenly Father promises to give us
00:17:01 “power beyond what is normal” so that we may,
00:17:05 as Luke 21:36 says,
00:17:09 “succeed in . . . standing before the Son of man.”
00:17:13 So then, whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,
00:17:18 we must heed the warnings found in Jesus’ parables
00:17:22 and thereby keep our names “written in the book of life.”

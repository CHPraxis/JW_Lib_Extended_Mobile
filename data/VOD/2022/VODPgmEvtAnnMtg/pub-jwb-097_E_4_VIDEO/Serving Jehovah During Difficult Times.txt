00:00:02 Jehovah provides
00:00:03 all of the things that we need
00:00:05 to accomplish our ministry
00:00:07 and to feel secure
00:00:08 no matter what tribulation we face.
00:00:11 We truly have experienced Jehovah’s loving support
00:00:15 during this pandemic.
00:00:17 Our heavenly Father, through his organization,
00:00:20 has provided just what we’ve needed
00:00:22 to endure faithfully in our ministry
00:00:24 and to stay strong spiritually.
00:00:27 How has the direction
00:00:29 to shelter in place affected circuit overseers,
00:00:32 construction servants, field missionaries,
00:00:36 and special pioneers?
00:00:38 How have they been able to continue in their ministry
00:00:41 serving Jehovah whole-souled and with joy?
00:00:45 What practical lessons have they learned?
00:00:49 To follow the Governing Body’s direction
00:00:52 to shelter in place,
00:00:53 we couldn’t go in to see Steve’s mother.
00:00:56 She was in aged care just ten minutes away
00:01:00 from where we’re based.
00:01:02 She died while we were sheltering in place.
00:01:05 This led to another challenge
00:01:08 —grieving in isolation.
00:01:11 At the beginning
00:01:12 of the shelter-in-place direction,
00:01:14 I had a very difficult time.
00:01:17 I had flashbacks
00:01:20 that were very difficult for me.
00:01:23 During the Vietnam War,
00:01:26 I was imprisoned because of taking a neutral stand.
00:01:31 I had a reaction to this lockdown
00:01:35 of being confined.
00:01:59 We especially discerned
00:02:01 the value of the direction in November 2020
00:02:04 when, suddenly,
00:02:05 I was taken to the hospital because of a serious heart disease
00:02:09 and severe pneumonia.
00:02:11 It turned out that my life was in danger.
00:02:15 The doctors evaluated that if I had contracted the coronavirus
00:02:19 in that condition,
00:02:21 I would not have had a chance to survive it.
00:02:24 While sheltering in place,
00:02:26 how did these obedient brothers and sisters stay positive
00:02:30 and maintain their physical, emotional, and spiritual health?
00:02:34 Even through that difficult time,
00:02:38 having Zoom  meetings,
00:02:40 having the meetings for field service,
00:02:43 doing witnessing by Zoom,
00:02:45 and being with the brothers and sisters
00:02:47 —I can’t say enough good about it.
00:02:50 In being able not to meet an hour requirement
00:02:54 but by going ahead and being very busy spiritually,
00:02:58 we did a phenomenal amount of shepherding,
00:03:01 strengthening, and upbuilding our brothers and sisters
00:03:05 —folks literally from around the world that we knew needed help.
00:03:08 When the Governing Body removed the specific hour requirement,
00:03:15 I think we felt their trust.
00:03:20 That gave us more flexibility,
00:03:23 and this enabled us to reach out
00:03:25 to relatives not in the truth
00:03:29 and to support them during the pandemic.
00:03:31 And that has led
00:03:33 to two, regular, continuing Bible studies.
00:03:39 I really feel how much
00:03:41 the Governing Body cares for us
00:03:43 every time they mention in their letters
00:03:45 that they do not require us to reach the required hours.
00:03:49 Many brothers and sisters today are depressed
00:03:53 and experiencing pandemic fatigue.
00:03:55 Usually they need someone
00:03:57 who they can talk to about their problems.
00:04:00 And because of these adjustments,
00:04:02 I now have more time to encourage them
00:04:04 and help them to remain spiritually strong.
00:04:35 Since most congregations I serve
00:04:37 don’t have Internet access,
00:04:40 I make video recordings for all the talks.
00:04:44 I make a simple platform and set up the microphone and cell phone
00:04:48 that I use to create the video.
00:04:50 Then I stand in front and start giving the talk.
00:04:55 What blessings did they receive from their obedience?
00:04:59 I was so happy to start a Bible study during the pandemic,
00:05:04 especially when I saw how quickly the student was making progress.
00:05:08 Because of my health,
00:05:10 each study session was about 15 to 20 minutes long.
00:05:14 I had to find a good place to conduct the study at the hospital,
00:05:18 mainly in the hallway.
00:05:20 One day after the concluding prayer,
00:05:22 I noticed the door to a doctor’s office was open.
00:05:26 The doctor was listening to our whole Bible study discussion.
00:05:31 I was so happy she attended the study as well.
00:06:02 Recently, in my circuit,
00:06:04 59 Bible students progressed to baptism.
00:06:09 Unity within families is another blessing.
00:06:13 Parents are spending a lot of time
00:06:15 conducting Bible studies with their children.
00:06:21 Our Christian life is compared to a race,
00:06:25 and this is not a short race.
00:06:27 There are unexpected things that can happen to us.
00:06:33 By striving to obey from the heart now,
00:06:37 we can be prepared to obey the directions
00:06:40 that we are going to receive in the great tribulation.
00:06:46 We are sure that this is not the last time
00:06:49 that we have to be obedient.
00:06:51 We see Bible prophecies being fulfilled
00:06:53 right in front of our eyes, and ahead of us are
00:06:56 even greater events that will bring larger trials.
00:07:00 James 1:2, 3 helps us despite trials to keep joy
00:07:05 —deep joy— in our hearts,
00:07:08 and it assures us that all difficult situations
00:07:10 will help us to work on endurance.
00:07:13 And this quality will help us to cope with trials to come.
00:07:19 I personally have benefited from following
00:07:22 the Governing Body’s direction.
00:07:24 I’ve actually felt joy every day,
00:07:28 and I can only put that down to the blessing from Jehovah God
00:07:33 on our efforts to be obedient.
00:07:36 We’ve both benefited from the direction from the Governing Body
00:07:41 because we trust
00:07:43 that they are “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:07:45 Christ Jesus is directing them.
00:07:48 I am so absolutely grateful
00:07:51 to the Governing Body for providing direction
00:07:56 that is blessing every single one of us around the earth.
00:08:01 Just like you,
00:08:03 these dear ones have made great sacrifices
00:08:06 to continue serving Jehovah whole-souled during this pandemic,
00:08:11 and no doubt we’ve all learned the value
00:08:13 of applying the words at 2 Timothy 4:2:
00:08:17 “Preach the word; be at it urgently
00:08:21 in favorable times and difficult times.”
00:08:24 For a certainty, neither this pandemic
00:08:28 nor any other difficult times to come
00:08:30 will stop our preaching work
00:08:33 and, more importantly, prevent
00:08:36 Jehovah’s loving care.

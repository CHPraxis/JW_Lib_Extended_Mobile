00:00:01 Aren’t we all glad that we are healthy enough
00:00:04 to be able to listen to the annual meeting program?
00:00:08 Yes, we don’t want to take it for granted.
00:00:11 Worldwide, some 20,000 of our brothers and sisters
00:00:16 have died so far from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:00:22 But tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters,
00:00:24 including many relatives,
00:00:26 have been and are now affected emotionally by this fact.
00:00:32 Death tolls affect friends and family,
00:00:35 and the feeling of loss is deep.
00:00:39 Secular sources say that the overall death rate in the United States
00:00:43 is about 1 percent of the population each year.
00:00:48 Every year around the world,
00:00:50 an average of over 60 million people die.
00:00:55 The daily average is about 164,000.
00:01:00 How sad!
00:01:03 With the COVID-19 plague,
00:01:05 the number of total deaths worldwide is, of course, higher.
00:01:10 In the United States, over 600,000 citizens
00:01:14 have died from COVID-19 alone.
00:01:19 Even when tempered by the hope of the resurrection,
00:01:23 the death of a loved one is still a traumatic loss
00:01:26 which is deeply felt.
00:01:30 Years, perhaps decades, of close companionship and sharing
00:01:35 are suddenly and tragically ended.
00:01:40 Of course, if those that died were part of our family,
00:01:44 it affects us much more emotionally.
00:01:49 We are also affected because we did not expect them to die,
00:01:53 except perhaps if some were in their 80’s or 90’s.
00:01:58 Even though we know that they will come back,
00:02:01 we still feel hurt and are very sorry
00:02:05 to have temporarily lost them.
00:02:09 It is very sad to lose somebody in death,
00:02:12 even temporarily, isn’t it?
00:02:17 In the case of Lazarus,
00:02:19 the Bible shows that even Jesus shed tears
00:02:22 when he saw the emotional pain
00:02:25 experienced by Lazarus’ sisters.
00:02:29 To be sad and to cry in the case of somebody’s death
00:02:33 is not an indication of somebody’s lack of faith
00:02:36 or an emotional imbalance.
00:02:40 Never feel ashamed in such a case.
00:02:43 Feel free to “[give] way to tears.”
00:02:50 At John 5:28, 29,
00:02:55 Jesus’ promise is comforting.
00:02:59 He said:
00:03:00 “Do not be amazed at this,
00:03:02 “[because] the hour is coming
00:03:04 “in which all those in the memorial tombs
00:03:07 “will hear [the Son of God’s] voice
00:03:09 “and come out, those who did good things
00:03:12 “to a resurrection of life,
00:03:14 “and those who practiced vile things
00:03:17 to a resurrection of judgment.”
00:03:20 However, Jehovah foretold that sickness and death
00:03:24 will not continue forever
00:03:26 but are temporary now
00:03:29 and will soon end as the new world arrives.
00:03:33 Even in the past, Jehovah miraculously proved
00:03:37 that he’s able to prevent sickness and subsequent death.
00:03:41 And he proved that he has the power
00:03:44 to bring back humans to life.
00:03:47 As much as we are sorry to have lost relatives
00:03:51 or friends in death
00:03:54 because of COVID-19 or any other reason,
00:03:57 we can rejoice that Jehovah will bring them back in the resurrection.
00:04:03 Jehovah brought back some of his servants
00:04:06 in the resurrection in the past.
00:04:09 The Bible speaks of nine specific resurrections of individuals.
00:04:15 Instead of reading a list with their names,
00:04:18 you can try to recall who these persons were.
00:04:22 If you don’t come up with nine persons,
00:04:25 why not make it a part of a conversation with friends to complete the list?
00:04:31 It refers to Jesus and eight additional ones.
00:04:36 It is so encouraging and comforting to talk about it.
00:04:42 Hebrews 11:35 speaks of a better resurrection,
00:04:48 better than the resurrection of the eight persons mentioned in the Bible
00:04:53 who had to die again at a later date.
00:04:57 The future resurrection is better
00:05:00 because it contains the possibility
00:05:03 to never die again in all eternity.
00:05:08 Imagine living not only for a thousand years
00:05:12 but for a million years,
00:05:14 for ten million years, for a hundred million years,
00:05:18 for a hundred billion years, and so on.
00:05:23 As for those being brought back in the resurrection,
00:05:26 the resurrection will be perceived like having happened
00:05:30 in the blink of an eye after their death,
00:05:32 although they may have been dead for quite some time.
00:05:38 For instance, when Lazarus was resurrected,
00:05:41 he did not recall that he was laying in the tomb.
00:05:46 When he was resurrected,
00:05:48 to him it was like the next moment
00:05:50 after he lost consciousness from dying.
00:05:54 When he came to,
00:05:56 he had no perception that he was in the tomb.
00:06:00 Jehovah created man originally.
00:06:04 He can also re-create a human.
00:06:08 Psalm 104:29, 30 says:
00:06:14 “When you hide your face,
00:06:16 “they are disturbed.
00:06:18 “If you take away their spirit,
00:06:20 “they die and return to the dust.
00:06:23 “If you send out the spirit,
00:06:25 they are created.”
00:06:27 Jehovah will give the resurrected ones a body
00:06:30 just as it pleases him.
00:06:33 Their bodies will be physically sound
00:06:35 and obviously look similar to the original body
00:06:39 so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.
00:06:44 Faithful Christians who die late during the time of the end
00:06:48 will likely be among the first ones to be raised again.
00:06:53 We can also expect an early resurrection
00:06:56 for some of the faithful men of old
00:06:58 who will join others as “princes” in the new world.
00:07:04 Nevertheless, we should not be dogmatic on such matters.
00:07:08 On many issues related to the resurrection,
00:07:12 the Bible is silent.
00:07:14 It does not spell out details of how,
00:07:17 when, or at what locations
00:07:19 the resurrection of individuals will occur.
00:07:23 It does not tell us how those returning
00:07:26 will be housed, fed, and clothed.
00:07:30 It would be unwise to spend a lot of time
00:07:33 trying to find answers that are at present unanswerable.
00:07:38 It is best to just focus
00:07:41 on the fact of the resurrection to come.
00:07:45 First Corinthians 15:52
00:07:49 also speaks of the resurrection
00:07:51 —not of an earthly resurrection,
00:07:54 but a heavenly, spiritual one.
00:07:58 This text refers to anointed ones
00:08:01 who would die and be raised “in the blink of an eye.”
00:08:06 This resurrection began during our time, the time of the end.
00:08:11 When they die, they go to heaven in an instant
00:08:15 —like during “the blink of an eye.”
00:08:19 But those who have the earthly hope to live forever on earth in Paradise
00:08:23 also will have the same perception later
00:08:27 when they will be resurrected in the Paradise.
00:08:31 The time from their death to the moment of their resurrection
00:08:35 will not be consciously experienced by them.
00:08:40 It will be for them like the ‘blinking of an eye.’
00:08:45 Those resurrected to heaven
00:08:48 will obtain immortality.
00:08:51 Those resurrected on earth will not be immortal
00:08:55 but have the chance to live forever as long as they remain faithful.
00:09:02 In connection with the ancient Israelites,
00:09:05 Jehovah also proved that he’s able to protect
00:09:08 his people from sicknesses.
00:09:11 And he did it when the Israelites remained faithful.
00:09:16 Deuteronomy 7:15 foretold
00:09:19 in connection with those who escaped from Egypt:
00:09:23 “Jehovah will take away from you all sickness,
00:09:27 “and he will not bring upon you
00:09:29 any of the terrible diseases that you have known in Egypt.”
00:09:36 We can trust that Jehovah fulfilled his promise.
00:09:39 He did so when the Israelites were faithful.
00:09:43 He blessed the Israelites with good health and long life.
00:09:48 This shows his past love for the people of Israel.
00:09:53 It also indicates his power
00:09:55 and that if he wishes to repeat this miracle,
00:09:59 he can do it, of course.
00:10:03 He will do so after Armageddon,
00:10:06 during the Millennium, or Thousand Year Reign of Christ.
00:10:11 Revelation 22:2 foretells
00:10:14 “the healing of the nations.”
00:10:17 This includes physical and emotional healing in the new world.
00:10:24 Death is really an enemy,
00:10:26 but Jehovah will do away with it.
00:10:30 At Isaiah 33:24, it says
00:10:33 that in the new world
00:10:35 “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”
00:10:42 There will be no hospitals.
00:10:44 There will be no drugstores.
00:10:46 There will be no physicians.
00:10:48 There will be no professional nurses.
00:10:53 At Revelation 21:4, it foretells that in the new world
00:10:57 there will be ‘neither mourning nor outcry nor pain anymore.’
00:11:04 We are very sad about what happened around the world
00:11:07 with so many of our brothers and sisters
00:11:09 falling asleep from COVID-19 recently,
00:11:12 but we know they will come back.
00:11:16 They will come back healthy.
00:11:18 They will not come back looking like old people,
00:11:23 even if they died at 80 years.
00:11:26 They might look like they are in their 30’s when resurrected.
00:11:31 As stated earlier,
00:11:33 they will look reasonably similar to their original body
00:11:37 so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.
00:11:42 How it fills our hearts with love for Jehovah
00:11:46 that he will bring back in the resurrection our loved ones!
00:11:52 The apostle Paul had a firm hope.
00:11:55 He explained at 2 Corinthians 1:7:
00:12:00 “Our hope for you is unwavering,
00:12:04 “knowing as we do that,
00:12:06 “just as you are sharers of the sufferings,
00:12:10 in the same way you will also share the comfort.”
00:12:15 At the conclusion of his letter, Paul urged:
00:12:19 “Continue . . . to be comforted, . . .
00:12:23 and the God of love and of peace will be with you.”
00:12:29 What an important lesson we can learn from this!
00:12:32 All members of the Christian congregation
00:12:35 need to share the comfort that God provides through his Word,
00:12:40 his holy spirit, and his earthly organization.
00:12:45 The principal source of comfort is, of course, Jehovah himself.
00:12:50 There’s no real lasting comfort that does not originate with God.
00:12:56 Appropriately, then, Paul wrote:
00:12:58 “[Blessed] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00:13:03 “the Father of tender mercies
00:13:05 “and the God of all comfort,
00:13:07 who comforts us in all our [tribulation].”
00:13:12 What inspiring words!
00:13:17 The Greek word here rendered “comfort”
00:13:20 is linked to “a calling to one side.”
00:13:24 Therefore, it is the standing beside a person to encourage him
00:13:29 when he’s undergoing severe testing.
00:13:33 One Biblical scholar wrote:
00:13:36 “The word . . . always means
00:13:38 “far more than soothing sympathy. . . .
00:13:42 “Christian comfort is the comfort which brings courage,
00:13:46 “the comfort which enables a man to cope
00:13:48 with all that life can do to him.”
00:13:53 It also includes comforting words
00:13:55 that are based on a solid promise and hope
00:13:58 —that of the resurrection of the dead.
00:14:03 So, what can we do to enhance the comfort for others?
00:14:09 Listen.
00:14:10 One of the most helpful things you can do
00:14:13 is to share the bereaved one’s pain by listening.
00:14:17 You may ask, “Would you care to talk about it?”
00:14:22 One Christian recalls when his father died,
00:14:26 “It really helped me when others asked what happened
00:14:29 and then really listened.”
00:14:33 Listen patiently and sympathetically.
00:14:37 “Weep with [people] who weep”
00:14:39 recommends the Bible at Romans 12:15.
00:14:43 Be available.
00:14:46 Make yourself available not just for the first few days
00:14:49 when many friends and relatives are present,
00:14:53 but for months later, if necessary,
00:14:56 when others have returned to their normal routine.
00:15:01 Our Christian interest and sympathy can mean so much
00:15:05 in any time of need.
00:15:08 The Bible says that “there exists a friend
00:15:11 sticking closer than a brother.”
00:15:16 Talk about the good qualities of the deceased person.
00:15:20 This is another great help.
00:15:23 Share positive anecdotes
00:15:26 that you recall about the individual,
00:15:29 and do not be afraid to use the person’s name.
00:15:33 Write a letter or send a comforting card.
00:15:38 Often overlooked is the value of a condolence letter
00:15:41 or a beautiful sympathy card.
00:15:44 Its advantage?
00:15:46 It can be read over and over again.
00:15:50 Such a letter need not be long,
00:15:53 but it should show your compassion.
00:15:57  Pray with them.
00:15:59 Do not underestimate the value of your prayers
00:16:03 with and for bereaved fellow Christians.
00:16:07 The Bible says at James 5:16:
00:16:11 “A righteous man’s supplication . . . has much force.”
00:16:18 Encourage sufferers to meditate on Jehovah.
00:16:22 He’s the God of all comfort.
00:16:25 He said in Isaiah:
00:16:28 “I [I] myself am the One
00:16:31 that is comforting you [people].”
00:16:34 He also said:
00:16:36 “Like a man whom his own mother keeps comforting,
00:16:40 so I myself shall keep comforting you people.”
00:16:47 Find with me Psalm 119.
00:16:51 Let’s first read verses 50, 52:
00:16:58 “This is my comfort in my affliction,
00:17:00 for your saying has preserved me alive.”
00:17:04 Verse 52:
00:17:06 “I remember your judgments from of old,
00:17:09 O Jehovah, and I find comfort in them.”
00:17:14 And now even verse 76:
00:17:17 “May your loyal love please comfort me,
00:17:21 “according to the promise
00:17:23 you made to your servant.”
00:17:26 Note that the word “comfort”
00:17:29 is used repeatedly in those passages.
00:17:33 Yes, we can find true comfort for ourselves and for others
00:17:38 by turning to Jehovah’s Word in our time of affliction.
00:17:43 This combined with the love and compassion of the brothers
00:17:47 can help us to live through our loss and fill our lives again
00:17:52 with joyful activity in the Christian ministry.
00:17:57 What a privilege to worship the Almighty,
00:18:00 our loving God, Jehovah,
00:18:02 who will bring back our loved ones in the resurrection!
00:18:07 There will never again be a pandemic
00:18:09 to claim the life of faithful servants.
00:18:13 Because at that time
00:18:15 “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

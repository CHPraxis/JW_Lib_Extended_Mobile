WEBVTT

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aren’t we all glad that we are healthy enough

00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to listen
to the annual meeting program?

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we don’t want to take it for granted.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Worldwide, some 20,000
of our brothers and sisters

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:21.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
have died so far from the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
But tens of thousands
of our brothers and sisters,

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
including many relatives,

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:31.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been and are now
affected emotionally by this fact.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Death tolls affect friends and family,

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the feeling of loss is deep.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Secular sources say that the overall
death rate in the United States

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
is about 1 percent
of the population each year.

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:50.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every year around the world,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
an average of over 60 million people die.

00:00:55.238 --> 00:01:00.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
The daily average is about 164,000.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
How sad!

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the COVID-19 plague,

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of total deaths
worldwide is, of course, higher.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the United States, over 600,000 citizens

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:17.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
have died from COVID-19 alone.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when tempered
by the hope of the resurrection,

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
the death of a loved one
is still a traumatic loss

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is deeply felt.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:35.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years, perhaps decades,
of close companionship and sharing

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:40.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
are suddenly and tragically ended.

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:44.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, if those that died
were part of our family,

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
it affects us much more emotionally.

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:53.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also affected
because we did not expect them to die,

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:57.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
except perhaps if some
were in their 80’s or 90’s.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:01.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we know that they will come back,

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:05.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
we still feel hurt and are very sorry

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:08.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have temporarily lost them.

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:12.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is very sad to lose somebody in death,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
even temporarily, isn’t it?

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:19.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the case of Lazarus,

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible shows that even Jesus shed tears

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he saw the emotional pain

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:28.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced by Lazarus’ sisters.

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be sad and to cry
in the case of somebody’s death

00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:36.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not an indication
of somebody’s lack of faith

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an emotional imbalance.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never feel ashamed in such a case.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feel free to “[give] way to tears.”

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 5:28, 29,

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ promise is comforting.

00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[because] the hour is coming

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will hear [the Son of God’s] voice

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and come out, those who did good things

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to a resurrection of life,

00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:17.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those who practiced vile things

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah foretold
that sickness and death

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not continue forever

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
but are temporary now

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:33.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will soon end as the new world arrives.

00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the past, Jehovah miraculously proved

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s able to prevent sickness
and subsequent death.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he proved that he has the power

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:46.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring back humans to life.

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:51.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
As much as we are sorry
to have lost relatives

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:54.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
or friends in death

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of COVID-19 or any other reason,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:02.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can rejoice that Jehovah
will bring them back in the resurrection.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah brought back some of his servants

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the resurrection in the past.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible speaks of nine
specific resurrections of individuals.

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of reading a list with their names,

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:22.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can try to recall who these persons were.

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t come up with nine persons,

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:30.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not make it a part of a conversation
with friends to complete the list?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
It refers to Jesus and eight additional ones.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is so encouraging and comforting
to talk about it.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:47.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:35
speaks of a better resurrection,

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:53.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
better than the resurrection
of the eight persons mentioned in the Bible

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had to die again at a later date.

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
The future resurrection is better

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it contains the possibility

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
to never die again in all eternity.

00:05:08.758 --> 00:05:12.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine living not only for a thousand years

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:14.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for a million years,

00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:18.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ten million years,
for a hundred million years,

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a hundred billion years, and so on.

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for those being
brought back in the resurrection,

00:05:26.442 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
the resurrection will be
perceived like having happened

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the blink of an eye after their death,

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:36.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
although they may have been
dead for quite some time.

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:41.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
when Lazarus was resurrected,

00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did not recall
that he was laying in the tomb.

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was resurrected,

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:50.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
to him it was like the next moment

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:54.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
after he lost consciousness from dying.

00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he came to,

00:05:56.906 --> 00:06:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had no perception that he was in the tomb.

00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:04.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created man originally.

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:07.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can also re-create a human.

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:13.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 104:29, 30 says:

00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:16.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When you hide your face,

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they are disturbed.

00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:20.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you take away their spirit,

00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:23.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they die and return to the dust.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you send out the spirit,

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:27.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are created.”

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:30.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will give the resurrected ones a body

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:33.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as it pleases him.

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their bodies will be physically sound

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obviously look similar
to the original body

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:42.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they will be recognized
by their loved ones.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithful Christians who die late
during the time of the end

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:52.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
will likely be among
the first ones to be raised again.

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:56.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also expect an early resurrection

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some of the faithful men of old

00:06:58.568 --> 00:07:03.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will join others
as “princes” in the new world.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, we should not be
dogmatic on such matters.

00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:12.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
On many issues related to the resurrection,

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:14.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is silent.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not spell out details of how,

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
when, or at what locations

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
the resurrection of individuals will occur.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not tell us how those returning

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:30.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be housed, fed, and clothed.

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:33.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be unwise to spend a lot of time

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to find answers
that are at present unanswerable.

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:41.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is best to just focus

00:07:41.277 --> 00:07:44.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the fact of the resurrection to come.

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:49.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 15:52

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
also speaks of the resurrection

00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not of an earthly resurrection,

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a heavenly, spiritual one.

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:01.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
This text refers to anointed ones

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:05.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would die and be raised
“in the blink of an eye.”

00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:10.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
This resurrection began during our time,
the time of the end.

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:15.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they die,
they go to heaven in an instant

00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:17.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like during “the blink of an eye.”

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:23.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those who have the earthly hope
to live forever on earth in Paradise

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:27.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
also will have the same perception later

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:30.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they will be
resurrected in the Paradise.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
The time from their death
to the moment of their resurrection

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be consciously experienced by them.

00:08:40.536 --> 00:08:44.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be for them
like the ‘blinking of an eye.’

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those resurrected to heaven

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
will obtain immortality.

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those resurrected on earth
will not be immortal

00:08:55.785 --> 00:09:00.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have the chance to live
forever as long as they remain faithful.

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:05.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
In connection with the ancient Israelites,

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also proved that he’s able to protect

00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
his people from sicknesses.

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:15.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he did it
when the Israelites remained faithful.

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:19.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 7:15 foretold

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:23.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
in connection with those
who escaped from Egypt:

00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:27.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will take away
from you all sickness,

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will not bring upon you

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:34.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of the terrible diseases
that you have known in Egypt.”

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:39.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust that Jehovah
fulfilled his promise.

00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did so when the Israelites were faithful.

00:09:43.366 --> 00:09:48.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
He blessed the Israelites
with good health and long life.

00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:53.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
This shows his past love
for the people of Israel.

00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:55.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also indicates his power

00:09:55.444 --> 00:09:59.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that if he wishes to repeat this miracle,

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
he can do it, of course.

00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:06.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will do so after Armageddon,

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:10.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Millennium,
or Thousand Year Reign of Christ.

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:14.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 22:2 foretells

00:10:14.997 --> 00:10:17.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the healing of the nations.”

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes physical and emotional
healing in the new world.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:26.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Death is really an enemy,

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:29.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah will do away with it.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 33:24, it says

00:10:33.849 --> 00:10:35.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in the new world

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no hospitals.

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:46.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no drugstores.

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no physicians.

00:10:48.998 --> 00:10:51.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no professional nurses.

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:57.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 21:4,
it foretells that in the new world

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be ‘neither mourning
nor outcry nor pain anymore.’

00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are very sad
about what happened around the world

00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:09.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
with so many of our brothers and sisters

00:11:09.652 --> 00:11:12.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
falling asleep from COVID-19 recently,

00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:16.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we know they will come back.

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:18.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will come back healthy.

00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:23.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will not come back
looking like old people,

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if they died at 80 years.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
They might look like they are
in their 30’s when resurrected.

00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:33.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated earlier,

00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:37.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will look reasonably similar
to their original body

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they will be recognized
by their loved ones.

00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:46.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
How it fills our hearts with love for Jehovah

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will bring back
in the resurrection our loved ones!

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul had a firm hope.

00:11:55.598 --> 00:12:00.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explained at 2 Corinthians 1:7:

00:12:00.603 --> 00:12:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our hope for you is unwavering,

00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:06.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“knowing as we do that,

00:12:06.942 --> 00:12:10.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you are sharers of the sufferings,

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the same way
you will also share the comfort.”

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:19.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the conclusion of his letter, Paul urged:

00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:23.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue . . . to be comforted, . . .

00:12:23.058 --> 00:12:27.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the God of love and of peace
will be with you.”

00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:32.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an important lesson
we can learn from this!

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:35.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
All members of the Christian congregation

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:40.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to share the comfort
that God provides through his Word,

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:45.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
his holy spirit,
and his earthly organization.

00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:50.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principal source of comfort is,
of course, Jehovah himself.

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:54.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no real lasting comfort
that does not originate with God.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:58.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appropriately, then, Paul wrote:

00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:03.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Blessed] be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:05.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Father of tender mercies

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the God of all comfort,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
who comforts us in all our [tribulation].”

00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:15.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
What inspiring words!

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:20.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word here rendered “comfort”

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
is linked to “a calling to one side.”

00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:29.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, it is the standing
beside a person to encourage him

00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:32.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he’s undergoing severe testing.

00:13:33.662 --> 00:13:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Biblical scholar wrote:

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The word . . . always means

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:42.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“far more than soothing sympathy. . . .

00:13:42.137 --> 00:13:46.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christian comfort
is the comfort which brings courage,

00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:48.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the comfort which enables a man to cope

00:13:48.644 --> 00:13:51.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all that life can do to him.”

00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:55.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also includes comforting words

00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:58.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are based on a solid promise and hope

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:02.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that of the resurrection of the dead.

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:08.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do
to enhance the comfort for others?

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:13.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the most helpful things you can do

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:17.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to share
the bereaved one’s pain by listening.

00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:21.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may ask,
“Would you care to talk about it?”

00:14:22.344 --> 00:14:26.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Christian recalls when his father died,

00:14:26.048 --> 00:14:29.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It really helped me
when others asked what happened

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:32.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then really listened.”

00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:37.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen patiently and sympathetically.

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Weep with [people] who weep”

00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
recommends the Bible at Romans 12:15.

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:46.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be available.

00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:49.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make yourself available
not just for the first few days

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:53.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
when many friends and relatives are present,

00:14:53.475 --> 00:14:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for months later, if necessary,

00:14:56.512 --> 00:14:59.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
when others have returned
to their normal routine.

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:05.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Christian interest and sympathy
can mean so much

00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:08.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
in any time of need.

00:15:08.457 --> 00:15:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that “there exists a friend

00:15:11.694 --> 00:15:14.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
sticking closer than a brother.”

00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:20.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about the good qualities
of the deceased person.

00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:23.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is another great help.

00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:26.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Share positive anecdotes

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you recall about the individual,

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:32.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not be afraid
to use the person’s name.

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:38.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Write a letter or send a comforting card.

00:15:38.053 --> 00:15:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often overlooked
is the value of a condolence letter

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a beautiful sympathy card.

00:15:44.493 --> 00:15:46.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its advantage?

00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:50.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be read over and over again.

00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:53.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such a letter need not be long,

00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:55.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it should show your compassion.

00:15:57.606 --> 00:15:59.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
 Pray with them.

00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:03.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not underestimate
the value of your prayers

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:07.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
with and for bereaved fellow Christians.

00:16:07.483 --> 00:16:11.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says at James 5:16:

00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A righteous man’s supplication . . .
has much force.”

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Encourage sufferers to meditate on Jehovah.

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the God of all comfort.

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:28.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said in Isaiah:

00:16:28.037 --> 00:16:31.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I [I] myself am the One

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:34.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is comforting you [people].”

00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:36.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also said:

00:16:36.512 --> 00:16:40.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like a man whom
his own mother keeps comforting,

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I myself shall
keep comforting you people.”

00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:51.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Find with me Psalm 119.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s first read verses 50, 52:

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my comfort in my affliction,

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your saying has preserved me alive.”

00:17:04.907 --> 00:17:06.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 52:

00:17:06.575 --> 00:17:09.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I remember your judgments from of old,

00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:13.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah, and I find comfort in them.”

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:17.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now even verse 76:

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May your loyal love please comfort me,

00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:23.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to the promise

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
you made to your servant.”

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:29.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note that the word “comfort”

00:17:29.398 --> 00:17:33.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
is used repeatedly in those passages.

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:38.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we can find true comfort
for ourselves and for others

00:17:38.574 --> 00:17:43.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
by turning to Jehovah’s Word
in our time of affliction.

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:47.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
This combined
with the love and compassion of the brothers

00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:52.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to live
through our loss and fill our lives again

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:56.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
with joyful activity
in the Christian ministry.

00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:00.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege to worship the Almighty,

00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:02.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
our loving God, Jehovah,

00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will bring back
our loved ones in the resurrection!

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:09.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will never again be a pandemic

00:18:09.872 --> 00:18:13.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
to claim the life of faithful servants.

00:18:13.108 --> 00:18:15.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because at that time

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day in April 2011,

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
the overseer of Audio/Video Services
came downstairs to postproduction

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gathered everybody into a little room,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said, “The Governing Body wants
to make an animated series for children,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they want to know if you can do it.”

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
So we all looked at each other.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:20.583 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everybody is looking around the room.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Are we really going
to make an animated series for children?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they really want this?’

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.006 line:10% position:50% align:center
Back in the 1990’s, the Governing Body

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.009 line:10% position:50% align:center
was asked if a fully animated video

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
for children could be considered,

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and evidently it was not the proper time
because the video was not approved.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a surprise in 2011

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Governing Body approved

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fully animated video series for children!

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:48.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team immediately worked
on creating a sample animation

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show not just technically

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they could create a character

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an environment
but also, more important,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show how a lesson

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be taught
and how this could be a powerful tool.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Teaching Committee loved it

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave full approval to produce the series.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:11.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one clever idea was to have
Caleb portrayed as a small boy

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:13.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a big, vivid imagination.

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
The intro with the stunt plane
was significant, I think, because it showed

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body
was sending a message

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to children everywhere,
saying that “this is for you,”

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it also said to them:

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This character, he’s just like you.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’s got an imagination, he likes to play,

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also, just like you,
he wants to be Jehovah’s friend.”

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:38.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that first video
had hard deadlines that had to be met.

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
To meet those targets,

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of the brothers
had to, at times, work

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 30 hours straight on their computer.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they would take a nap,
get back up, and continue their work.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the brothers had a beautiful spirit.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told me that a soldier

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not work from 8:00 to 5:00.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does whatever the cause demands.

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is at war with our children.

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll do whatever it takes
to combat the Devil.

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:06.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body completely
shaped the teaching

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the tone of this series—
as you would expect.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one example was in the lesson
on obedience, where Caleb

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaves his toys out
and doesn’t listen to his mom.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:18.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
An initial idea by the team was

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:22.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
that somebody slips on a toy,
knocks over a candle, curtains catch on fire

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Boom!—
and the house burns to the ground.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that went to the Governing Body,
and they reviewed it, and they said:

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, that’s pretty scary.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try a different idea; that’s a bit much.”

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.840 line:10% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want to do anything

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.676 line:10% position:50% align:center
that needlessly frightened the children.

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:39.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we try to look at it
from the parents’ perspective,

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some things we would not approve.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though the Governing Body
rejected some of the team’s ideas,

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
they made it a point to let the team know:

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We want these creative ideas.
We encourage the creativity.”

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really touched us.
It meant a lot to us.

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
It kept the team motivated
to keep presenting ideas.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
We also had to plan out

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.494 line:10% position:50% align:center
how translating branches

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:06.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
would produce each
of the pieces needed for their DVD.

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:09.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
As each branch had finished their DVD,

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:13.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
we put a copy of it
on our wall to track the progress.

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:17.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
To our surprise, the wall
started to fill up with discs,

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:19.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they spilled over to the next wall.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was so encouraging
for our team to see the progress.

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:27.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we were really excited
to release it at the convention,

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was amazing
—the work that went into it!

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to release it
in over 130 languages, the first one.

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s remarkable is

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:46.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
that young ones are using this tool
to apply Bible principles

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
even before they’re old enough
to attend school,

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s helping them progress
to the point of baptism.

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our son, Malcolm, was baptized in 2018.

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to his baptism,

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was still young and learning,

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:04.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were worried because Malcolm
had a problem with lying.

00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:08.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that the big, green, slimy things
kept on growing bigger and bigger

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:10.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Caleb kept lying.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing them, I had the picture
of them stuck in my head.

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
So every time
I ever wanted to or felt like lying,

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would imagine them behind me

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
growing bigger and bigger as well.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that helped me quite a lot.

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.410 line:10% position:50% align:center
After watching Caleb’s father

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:30.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
lovingly talking to Caleb
and seeing Caleb listening when his father

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
used Bible characters to teach Caleb,

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried it with Soo-ah.

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:37.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soo-ah was receptive to this method

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:40.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listened well
to what we wanted to teach her.

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made me realize

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
how effective the videos are.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:47.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are very grateful.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:52.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
We, as parents,
are especially grateful to Jehovah

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:56.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
for teaching us methods
on how to raise our children well.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to be Jehovah’s friend
like Mom and Dad.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had the privilege
over these past ten years

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet a lot of the children

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:12.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of them when they first
were being shown

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
the videos and then grew a few years—

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:20.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is just so very evident
that Jehovah blessed the project

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
because “wisdom
is proved righteous by its works.”

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has worked.

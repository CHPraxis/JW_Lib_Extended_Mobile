00:00:03 One day in April 2011,
00:00:05 the overseer of Audio/Video Services came downstairs to postproduction
00:00:09 and gathered everybody into a little room,
00:00:11 and he said, “The Governing Body wants to make an animated series for children,
00:00:15 and they want to know if you can do it.”
00:00:17 So we all looked at each other.
00:00:19 Everybody is looking around the room.
00:00:20 ‘Are we really going to make an animated series for children?
00:00:23 Do they really want this?’
00:00:24 Back in the 1990’s, the Governing Body
00:00:27 was asked if a fully animated video
00:00:30 for children could be considered,
00:00:32 and evidently it was not the proper time because the video was not approved.
00:00:36 But what a surprise in 2011
00:00:39 when the Governing Body approved
00:00:41 a fully animated video series for children!
00:00:45 The team immediately worked on creating a sample animation
00:00:48 to show not just technically
00:00:51 how they could create a character
00:00:53 in an environment but also, more important,
00:00:55 to show how a lesson
00:00:57 could be taught and how this could be a powerful tool.
00:00:59 The Teaching Committee loved it
00:01:01 and gave full approval to produce the series.
00:01:06 Well, one clever idea was to have Caleb portrayed as a small boy
00:01:11 with a big, vivid imagination.
00:01:13 The intro with the stunt plane was significant, I think, because it showed
00:01:18 that the Governing Body was sending a message
00:01:20 to children everywhere, saying that “this is for you,”
00:01:23 but it also said to them:
00:01:25 “This character, he’s just like you.
00:01:27 “He’s got an imagination, he likes to play,
00:01:29 and also, just like you, he wants to be Jehovah’s friend.”
00:01:35 Well, that first video had hard deadlines that had to be met.
00:01:38 To meet those targets,
00:01:39 some of the brothers had to, at times, work
00:01:42 for 30 hours straight on their computer.
00:01:44 Then they would take a nap, get back up, and continue their work.
00:01:48 But the brothers had a beautiful spirit.
00:01:50 They told me that a soldier
00:01:52 does not work from 8:00 to 5:00.
00:01:54 He does whatever the cause demands.
00:01:56 Satan is at war with our children.
00:01:59 We’ll do whatever it takes to combat the Devil.
00:02:03 The Governing Body completely shaped the teaching
00:02:06 —the tone of this series— as you would expect.
00:02:09 And one example was in the lesson on obedience, where Caleb
00:02:13 leaves his toys out and doesn’t listen to his mom.
00:02:16 An initial idea by the team was
00:02:18 that somebody slips on a toy, knocks over a candle, curtains catch on fire
00:02:22 —Boom!— and the house burns to the ground.
00:02:23 So that went to the Governing Body, and they reviewed it, and they said:
00:02:26 “Well, that’s pretty scary.
00:02:28 Try a different idea; that’s a bit much.”
00:02:30 We didn’t want to do anything
00:02:32 that needlessly frightened the children.
00:02:35 So we try to look at it from the parents’ perspective,
00:02:39 and some things we would not approve.
00:02:42 Even though the Governing Body rejected some of the team’s ideas,
00:02:45 they made it a point to let the team know:
00:02:48 “We want these creative ideas. We encourage the creativity.”
00:02:51 And that really touched us. It meant a lot to us.
00:02:54 It kept the team motivated to keep presenting ideas.
00:02:57 We also had to plan out
00:03:00 how translating branches
00:03:02 would produce each of the pieces needed for their DVD.
00:03:06 As each branch had finished their DVD,
00:03:09 we put a copy of it on our wall to track the progress.
00:03:13 To our surprise, the wall started to fill up with discs,
00:03:17 and they spilled over to the next wall.
00:03:19 That was so encouraging for our team to see the progress.
00:03:24 So we were really excited to release it at the convention,
00:03:27 and it was amazing —the work that went into it!
00:03:31 We were able to release it in over 130 languages, the first one.
00:03:39 What’s remarkable is
00:03:41 that young ones are using this tool to apply Bible principles
00:03:46 even before they’re old enough to attend school,
00:03:48 and it’s helping them progress to the point of baptism.
00:03:52 Our son, Malcolm, was baptized in 2018.
00:03:56 Prior to his baptism,
00:03:58 when he was still young and learning,
00:04:00 we were worried because Malcolm had a problem with lying.
00:04:04 I noticed that the big, green, slimy things kept on growing bigger and bigger
00:04:08 as Caleb kept lying.
00:04:10 Seeing them, I had the picture of them stuck in my head.
00:04:13 So every time I ever wanted to or felt like lying,
00:04:16 I would imagine them behind me
00:04:18 growing bigger and bigger as well.
00:04:20 And that helped me quite a lot.
00:04:22 After watching Caleb’s father
00:04:26 lovingly talking to Caleb and seeing Caleb listening when his father
00:04:30 used Bible characters to teach Caleb,
00:04:32 I tried it with Soo-ah.
00:04:34 Soo-ah was receptive to this method
00:04:37 and listened well to what we wanted to teach her.
00:04:40 This made me realize
00:04:42 how effective the videos are.
00:04:44 We are very grateful.
00:04:48 We, as parents, are especially grateful to Jehovah
00:04:52 for teaching us methods on how to raise our children well.
00:04:58 I want to be Jehovah’s friend like Mom and Dad.
00:05:02 I’ve had the privilege over these past ten years
00:05:05 to meet a lot of the children
00:05:07 —some of them when they first were being shown
00:05:12 the videos and then grew a few years—
00:05:15 and it is just so very evident that Jehovah blessed the project
00:05:20 because “wisdom is proved righteous by its works.”
00:05:23 This has worked.

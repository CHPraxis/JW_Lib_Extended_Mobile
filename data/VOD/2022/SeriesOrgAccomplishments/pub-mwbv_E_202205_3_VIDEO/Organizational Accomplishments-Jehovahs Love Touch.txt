00:00:12 We love our conventions and assemblies.
00:00:17 We praise Jehovah and feed at his table
00:00:19 with hundreds of our brothers and sisters.
00:00:22 Many of our brothers and sisters in rural areas of Africa
00:00:26 attend assemblies and conventions in open-air meeting places.
00:00:31 Sadly,
00:00:32 at times the conditions are not favorable,
00:00:35 making it difficult to fully benefit
00:00:38 from the spiritual food.
00:00:40 But at Isaiah 49:15, Jehovah says:
00:00:44 “Can a woman forget her nursing child
00:00:48 “or have no compassion for the son of her womb?
00:00:52 “Even if these women forget,
00:00:54 I would never forget you.”
00:00:57 Jehovah has shown his love
00:00:59 to our brothers and sisters in Africa
00:01:02 in a special way.
00:01:04 How was this done?
00:01:06 What were the challenges that made this situation so dire?
00:01:10 One of the challenges
00:01:12 the brothers have to face
00:01:13 is the distance that they have to travel
00:01:16 to get to the Assembly Hall.
00:01:18 In some parts of the country, there’s no reliable transportation,
00:01:23 so the brothers either have to hire a truck or they have to use a bicycle,
00:01:28 and in some cases, they even have to walk long distances
00:01:30 —sometimes even between four to six hours.
00:01:34 It was a huge challenge to attend
00:01:36 a regional convention.
00:01:39 First, we started saving up ahead of time
00:01:42 to get the money for transportation and lunch
00:01:44 for the three days of the convention.
00:01:47 But if we could not find the money, we would go by foot,
00:01:51 carrying chairs on our heads and food in our hands.
00:01:57 And sometimes after arriving,
00:01:59 you were so tired.
00:02:01 You could not concentrate on what the brothers were teaching
00:02:03 because you were sweating and incredibly tired.
00:02:08 When the brothers and sisters
00:02:10 attend outdoor assemblies,
00:02:11 they are exposed to a number of challenges.
00:02:15 During the rainy season when there is a big storm,
00:02:18 it can completely stop the program for a while.
00:02:22 Sometimes when it rained, everyone had to leave their spot to hide somewhere.
00:02:27 Imagine you had someone there that you invited,
00:02:30 and then when the rain started, they had to run and hide somewhere.
00:02:33 We were sad and ashamed to invite people.
00:02:39 In many cases, the brothers just have to sit on the ground.
00:02:42 Some will sit on small stones
00:02:45 or on a mat or on a piece of cloth,
00:02:47 and they have to bear the heat of the sun because there is no proper shade
00:02:52 or just a simple grass structure over their heads.
00:02:56 These structures did not really protect us, because in the heat, we really suffered;
00:03:01 we moved from one place to another.
00:03:04 If the heat followed, we would move again to another spot.
00:03:08 The teaching and spiritual instruction suffers.
00:03:12 The brothers and sisters cannot concentrate on closely following the program.
00:03:17 To address these challenges,
00:03:19 the Publishing Committee of the Governing Body asked
00:03:23 the Global Purchasing and Regional Design/Construction departments
00:03:27 to work with various branches
00:03:30 to improve the situation.
00:03:33 The goal was to provide dignified places of worship
00:03:37 where our brothers and sisters could enjoy
00:03:40 this spiritual learning environment
00:03:43 with minimal distractions.
00:03:45 The branches provided input
00:03:47 of exactly what the situation was
00:03:50 —showed some pictures, showed what the challenges are,
00:03:53 and in what areas at this moment these assemblies are being held.
00:03:58 One of the requirements that they put in there was
00:04:00 that they wanted to be able to build it up quickly
00:04:03 and also to disassemble it quickly
00:04:06 so that it could be moved to another assembly site.
00:04:09 And with that information, we worked together with RDC
00:04:13 to see what was something that fit in a cost-effective way.
00:04:17 And one option that we had from a supplier was a standard tent,
00:04:22 and one was a customized shade structure.
00:04:26 So after the approval was received from these branches
00:04:29 and also from the Publishing Committee,
00:04:32 we started to place the orders
00:04:34 and work together with the branches to get them actually on site.
00:04:39 As these projects were implemented,
00:04:41 a training program was also started.
00:04:44 Using qualified trainers, some local construction servants
00:04:48 were trained to safely install, pack,
00:04:51 and maintain the tents.
00:04:53 These construction servants then trained local congregation publishers to do the same.
00:04:58 The training provided was so effective that in some cases
00:05:01 tents for an entire venue of 2,000 seats
00:05:04 were put up in just one day!
00:05:07 It’s a very simple structure with a little shade material over it
00:05:12 so that the brothers and sisters can sit in the shade,
00:05:14 or if there’s heavy rain, they have a nice place
00:05:17 where they can follow the program without much distraction
00:05:21 and can really see all the videos that the Governing Body
00:05:24 provides at this moment.
00:05:27 Seeing how different departments and branches worked together
00:05:31 —the willing and happy spirit of all involved,
00:05:33 especially the local brothers—
00:05:35 was clear evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on this project.
00:05:39 Truly, this is a special gift from Jehovah!
00:05:44 It is truly encouraging to see how Jehovah blessed the collaboration
00:05:49 and hard work of so many.
00:05:52 This loving provision from Jehovah
00:05:54 has touched the hearts of our brothers and sisters.
00:05:57 What I can say?
00:06:00 What I really feel deep inside on this matter
00:06:03 when I see what Jehovah has done for us
00:06:07 —the beautiful assembly site and nice shade,
00:06:10 when I see brothers and sisters safe from sun and rain—
00:06:14 I feel that Jehovah has dignified us.
00:06:19 I have seen Jehovah’s great love for us;
00:06:22 it is amazing.
00:06:24 Before, we never imagined that we could attend
00:06:26 a convention at a good place like this,
00:06:28 but seeing this provision helps us to understand
00:06:31 that Jehovah loves us so much.
00:06:34 We are so happy because the place is attractive.
00:06:38 There are nice places to sit, and now we can invite anyone to come attend with us.
00:06:43 We do not need to imagine someone we invited having to run and hide if it rains.
00:06:47 We no longer feel ashamed or scared to invite people because we know
00:06:51 that they can stay in their place the whole time.
00:06:54 After all, this place has truly become very beautiful.
00:06:59 I thank Jehovah so much.
00:07:02 I also thank the Governing Body
00:07:04 for helping us get such a beautiful Assembly Hall.
00:07:07 We do not have to go back and forth with chairs on our heads anymore.
00:07:11 We have good seats that allow us to concentrate
00:07:13 on what Jehovah is teaching us.
00:07:15 Thank you so much, dear brothers.
00:07:19 There is a growing demand for these facilities.
00:07:22 Over 100 more sites in Africa are needed right now.
00:07:27 It is our privilege to support this initiative
00:07:30 with our personal prayers and donations.
00:07:34 For Jehovah, no location
00:07:37 is too remote.
00:07:40 He does not forget his people.
00:07:43 He uses his organization to provide what they need
00:07:48 at the right place and at the right time.

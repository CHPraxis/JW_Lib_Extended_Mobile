WEBVTT

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:17.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love our conventions and assemblies.

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
We praise Jehovah and feed at his table

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
with hundreds of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our brothers and sisters
in rural areas of Africa

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:31.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
attend assemblies and conventions
in open-air meeting places.

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:32.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly,

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:35.309 line:10% position:50% align:center
at times the conditions are not favorable,

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.271 line:10% position:50% align:center
making it difficult to fully benefit

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.814 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the spiritual food.

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:44.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at Isaiah 49:15, Jehovah says:

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:48.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can a woman forget her nursing child

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or have no compassion
for the son of her womb?

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:54.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even if these women forget,

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:57.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never forget you.”

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has shown his love

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:02.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our brothers and sisters in Africa

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a special way.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was this done?

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were the challenges
that made this situation so dire?

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:12.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
One of the challenges

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:13.935 line:10% position:50% align:center
the brothers have to face

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.605 line:10% position:50% align:center
is the distance that they have to travel

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to the Assembly Hall.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some parts of the country,
there’s no reliable transportation,

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:28.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the brothers either have to hire a truck
or they have to use a bicycle,

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in some cases,
they even have to walk long distances

00:01:30.954 --> 00:01:33.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
—sometimes even between four to six hours.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.835 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was a huge challenge to attend

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:39.463 line:10% position:50% align:center
a regional convention.

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:42.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we started saving up ahead of time

00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get the money for transportation and lunch

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the three days of the convention.

00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:51.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we could not find the money,
we would go by foot,

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:54.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
carrying chairs on our heads
and food in our hands.

00:01:57.108 --> 00:01:59.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
And sometimes after arriving,

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:01.029 line:10% position:50% align:center
you were so tired.

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could not concentrate
on what the brothers were teaching

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you were sweating
and incredibly tired.

00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:10.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
When the brothers and sisters

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.874 line:10% position:50% align:center
attend outdoor assemblies,

00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:15.044 line:10% position:50% align:center
they are exposed to a number of challenges.

00:02:15.044 --> 00:02:18.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the rainy season
when there is a big storm,

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:21.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can completely stop the program
for a while.

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:27.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes when it rained, everyone had
to leave their spot to hide somewhere.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine you had someone there
that you invited,

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then when the rain started,
they had to run and hide somewhere.

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:37.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were sad and ashamed to invite people.

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
In many cases, the brothers
just have to sit on the ground.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:45.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some will sit on small stones

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:47.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
or on a mat or on a piece of cloth,

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:52.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they have to bear the heat of the sun
because there is no proper shade

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just a simple grass structure
over their heads.

00:02:56.798 --> 00:03:01.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
These structures did not really protect us,
because in the heat, we really suffered;

00:03:01.804 --> 00:03:04.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
we moved from one place to another.

00:03:04.432 --> 00:03:08.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the heat followed,
we would move again to another spot.

00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:12.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teaching
and spiritual instruction suffers.

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters cannot concentrate
on closely following the program.

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
To address these challenges,

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Publishing Committee
of the Governing Body asked

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:27.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Global Purchasing and Regional
Design/Construction departments

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with various branches

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
to improve the situation.

00:03:33.172 --> 00:03:37.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal was to provide
dignified places of worship

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
where our brothers and sisters could enjoy

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:43.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
this spiritual learning environment

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
with minimal distractions.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
The branches provided input

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:50.232 line:10% position:50% align:center
of exactly what the situation was

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:53.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
—showed some pictures,
showed what the challenges are,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in what areas at this moment
these assemblies are being held.

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the requirements
that they put in there was

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:03.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they wanted to be able
to build it up quickly

00:04:03.872 --> 00:04:06.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to disassemble it quickly

00:04:06.584 --> 00:04:09.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it could be moved
to another assembly site.

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:13.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with that information,
we worked together with RDC

00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:17.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what was something
that fit in a cost-effective way.

00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:22.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one option that we had from a supplier
was a standard tent,

00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:26.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one was a customized shade structure.

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:29.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after the approval was received
from these branches

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:32.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also from the Publishing Committee,

00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:34.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
we started to place the orders

00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:39.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
and work together with the branches
to get them actually on site.

00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:41.414 line:10% position:50% align:center
As these projects were implemented,

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.250 line:10% position:50% align:center
a training program was also started.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using qualified trainers,
some local construction servants

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:51.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
were trained to safely install, pack,

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:53.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain the tents.

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:58.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
These construction servants then trained
local congregation publishers to do the same.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
The training provided was so effective
that in some cases

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:04.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
tents for an entire venue of 2,000 seats

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:06.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
were put up in just one day!

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a very simple structure
with a little shade material over it

00:05:12.073 --> 00:05:14.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the brothers and sisters
can sit in the shade,

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if there’s heavy rain,
they have a nice place

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they can follow the program
without much distraction

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:24.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can really see all the videos
that the Governing Body

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:27.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides at this moment.

00:05:27.298 --> 00:05:31.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing how different departments
and branches worked together

00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:33.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the willing and happy spirit
of all involved,

00:05:33.763 --> 00:05:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially the local brothers—

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
was clear evidence of Jehovah’s blessing
on this project.

00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:43.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, this is a special gift from Jehovah!

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is truly encouraging to see
how Jehovah blessed the collaboration

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:52.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hard work of so many.

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:54.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
This loving provision from Jehovah

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:57.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
has touched the hearts
of our brothers and sisters.

00:05:57.998 --> 00:06:00.042 line:10% position:50% align:center
What I can say?

00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:03.796 line:10% position:50% align:center
What I really feel deep inside on this matter

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:07.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I see what Jehovah has done for us

00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:10.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the beautiful assembly site and nice shade,

00:06:10.554 --> 00:06:14.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I see brothers and sisters
safe from sun and rain—

00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:18.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that Jehovah has dignified us.

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:22.692 line:10% position:50% align:center
I have seen Jehovah’s great love for us;

00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:24.110 line:10% position:50% align:center
it is amazing.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before, we never imagined
that we could attend

00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:28.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
a convention at a good place like this,

00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:31.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
but seeing this provision
helps us to understand

00:06:31.952 --> 00:06:34.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah loves us so much.

00:06:34.705 --> 00:06:38.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so happy
because the place is attractive.

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are nice places to sit, and now we
can invite anyone to come attend with us.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:47.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not need to imagine someone we invited
having to run and hide if it rains.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
We no longer feel ashamed or scared
to invite people because we know

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they can stay in their place
the whole time.

00:06:54.727 --> 00:06:59.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, this place has truly become
very beautiful.

00:06:59.483 --> 00:07:02.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thank Jehovah so much.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also thank the Governing Body

00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:07.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
for helping us get
such a beautiful Assembly Hall.

00:07:07.283 --> 00:07:11.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not have to go back and forth
with chairs on our heads anymore.

00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:13.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have good seats
that allow us to concentrate

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what Jehovah is teaching us.

00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:18.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, dear brothers.

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:22.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a growing demand
for these facilities.

00:07:22.716 --> 00:07:27.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 100 more sites in Africa
are needed right now.

00:07:27.472 --> 00:07:30.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our privilege
to support this initiative

00:07:30.642 --> 00:07:34.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our personal prayers and donations.

00:07:34.938 --> 00:07:37.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Jehovah, no location

00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:40.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
is too remote.

00:07:40.278 --> 00:07:43.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not forget his people.

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:48.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
He uses his organization
to provide what they need

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:52.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right place and at the right time.

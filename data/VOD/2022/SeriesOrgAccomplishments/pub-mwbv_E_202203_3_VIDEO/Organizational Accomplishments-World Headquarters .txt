00:00:11 The Governing Body does
00:00:12 a tremendous amount of work
00:00:14 in preparing instruction
00:00:16 based on the powerful Word of God.
00:00:20 But how does spiritual food
00:00:22 in the form of audio and video programs
00:00:25 reach all those wanting to enjoy it?
00:00:29 In 2014, the Teaching Committee of the Governing Body
00:00:32 approved the formation
00:00:34 of the World Headquarters Broadcasting Department.
00:00:39 This was to help transmit spiritual programs
00:00:42 to people all around the world.
00:00:46 First Corinthians 14:9 says in part:
00:00:50 “Unless you with the tongue use speech that is easily understood,
00:00:55 how will anyone know what is being said?”
00:00:58 At our theocratic events,
00:01:00 the audience needs to see the videos clearly
00:01:03 and to hear the talks and music easily.
00:01:06 How does the Broadcasting Department make this possible?
00:01:10 Our work in Broadcasting is really twofold:
00:01:13 We focus on program transmission . . .
00:01:16 . . . and the equipment needed to make that happen.
00:01:22 For a convention program to really reach people’s hearts,
00:01:25 they have to be able to see it and they have to be able to hear it.
00:01:28 So the World Headquarters Broadcasting Department
00:01:30 works with broadcasting departments at branches around the world
00:01:33 to try to make that happen.
00:01:35 The audio/video equipment that we use is very expensive,
00:01:38 so we’re constantly looking for ways that we can save dedicated funds.
00:01:43 When the organization began to show
00:01:45 video content at conventions,
00:01:47 we responded to help branches
00:01:49 in developing lands
00:01:50 obtain the equipment they needed.
00:01:52 These countries had very limited resources.
00:01:55 It wasn’t just that the equipment was expensive,
00:01:58 but how do you get a video wall
00:02:01 to a rural convention site in Africa?
00:02:04 Once it’s there, how do you power it?
00:02:07 Who’s going to operate it?
00:02:10 In some venues
00:02:12 where we hold regional conventions,
00:02:14 they don’t have electricity.
00:02:16 Additionally, getting the necessary equipment to all of the events can be challenging
00:02:21 —for example, the lack of roads and highways,
00:02:23 transporting the equipment by sea on a small boat,
00:02:27 as well as having to use the same video equipment
00:02:29 at several conventions and delivering it on time.
00:02:33 Congo (Kinshasa)
00:02:35 is the size of Western Europe.
00:02:37 But only a handful of cities
00:02:38 are connected by paved roads.
00:02:41 Many areas are accessible only during the dry season
00:02:45 using either Land Cruisers,
00:02:47 motorbikes, dugout canoes, bicycles,
00:02:50 or simply on foot.
00:02:52 So transporting materials to certain areas
00:02:54 can easily take several months.
00:03:00 To meet the need for the Ngäbere regional conventions,
00:03:03 the Broadcasting Department at world headquarters
00:03:05 recommended that we purchase a portable LED display
00:03:08 that could be transported easily.
00:03:11 This meant manufacturing cases that were lighter,
00:03:15 transporting the equipment by sea on a small boat,
00:03:18 and using wheelbarrows.
00:03:21 Also, the brothers had to carry the equipment,
00:03:27 which included portable power generators and gasoline,
00:03:31 for three hours on narrow, steep, slippery, and rocky paths.
00:03:36 At times, they made use of horses.
00:03:38 In 2015, things started to change rapidly with the support
00:03:43 of the World Headquarters Broadcasting Department
00:03:45 and the Regional Purchasing Office in Asia.
00:03:49 For the 2019 regional convention series,
00:03:52 95 percent of the nearly 850,000 attendees
00:03:57 had clear audio and video transmission for the entire program.
00:04:03 I thank Jehovah so much
00:04:05 that we can enjoy watching the videos,
00:04:07 reports, experiences,
00:04:09 and music videos so clearly.
00:04:12 Now we have a better experience
00:04:14 when we get to know our Instructor more
00:04:16 in ways that touch our heart.
00:04:22 JW Stream is an online tool
00:04:24 that was primarily designed as a way for us to broadcast
00:04:27 everything from large events that might go to millions of people
00:04:30 down to small events that would be seen by just a few.
00:04:33 Really, it’s our primary method of broadcast.
00:04:36 It can also be used to make online content available on demand as needed.
00:04:41 An example of this on-demand content
00:04:43 is recorded congregation meetings.
00:04:46 These recordings are made for the benefit of the multi-language field.
00:04:50 Globally, groups as well as congregations that might be small or isolated
00:04:55 are able to benefit from these meetings.
00:05:01 When I can hear meetings from Thailand,
00:05:03 where the brothers use words and expressions
00:05:05 that touch my heart,
00:05:07 it helps my faith get stronger.
00:05:09 It’s like a tree that gets good fertilizer,
00:05:12 which makes deep roots that result in the tree progressing better.
00:05:17 Thanks to the hard work
00:05:19 of the World Headquarters Broadcasting Department,
00:05:22 Bible instruction is being transmitted
00:05:24 at our theocratic events like never before!
00:05:29 These spiritual programs not only touch our hearts
00:05:32 but also draw us closer
00:05:34 to our “Grand Instructor,” Jehovah God.

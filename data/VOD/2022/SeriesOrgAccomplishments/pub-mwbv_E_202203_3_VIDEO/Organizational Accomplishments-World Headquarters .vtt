The Governing Body does

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a tremendous amount of work

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in preparing instruction

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on the powerful Word of God.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does spiritual food

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of audio and video programs

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reach all those wanting to enjoy it?

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2014, the Teaching Committee
of the Governing Body

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
approved the formation

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the World Headquarters
Broadcasting Department.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was to help transmit spiritual programs

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to people all around the world.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:50.780 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 14:9 says in part:

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless you with the tongue
use speech that is easily understood,

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will anyone know what is being said?”

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At our theocratic events,

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the audience needs to see the videos clearly

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hear the talks and music easily.

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does the Broadcasting Department
make this possible?

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.094 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our work in Broadcasting is really twofold:

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.262 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We focus on program transmission . . .

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and the equipment needed
to make that happen.

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a convention program
to really reach people’s hearts,

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have to be able to see it
and they have to be able to hear it.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the World Headquarters
Broadcasting Department

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
works with broadcasting departments
at branches around the world

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:35.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to make that happen.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The audio/video equipment
that we use is very expensive,

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’re constantly looking for ways
that we can save dedicated funds.

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:45.209 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When the organization began to show

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
video content at conventions,

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:49.171 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we responded to help branches

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in developing lands

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obtain the equipment they needed.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These countries had very limited resources.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just that the equipment
was expensive,

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how do you get a video wall

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a rural convention site in Africa?

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once it’s there, how do you power it?

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s going to operate it?

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:12.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In some venues

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.238 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where we hold regional conventions,

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:16.240 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they don’t have electricity.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, getting the necessary equipment
to all of the events can be challenging

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for example, the lack of roads and highways,

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
transporting the equipment
by sea on a small boat,

00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:29.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as having to use
the same video equipment

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:32.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at several conventions
and delivering it on time.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.718 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Congo (Kinshasa)

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:37.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is the size of Western Europe.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.888 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But only a handful of cities

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:41.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are connected by paved roads.

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many areas are accessible
only during the dry season

00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using either Land Cruisers,

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:50.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motorbikes, dugout canoes, bicycles,

00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or simply on foot.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So transporting materials to certain areas

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can easily take several months.

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To meet the need
for the Ngäbere regional conventions,

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Broadcasting Department
at world headquarters

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recommended that we purchase
a portable LED display

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be transported easily.

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This meant manufacturing cases
that were lighter,

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:17.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
transporting the equipment
by sea on a small boat,

00:03:18.344 --> 00:03:20.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and using wheelbarrows.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:25.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the brothers
had to carry the equipment,

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:31.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included
portable power generators and gasoline,

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:36.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for three hours
on narrow, steep, slippery, and rocky paths.

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, they made use of horses.

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:43.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2015, things started
to change rapidly with the support

00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:45.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the World Headquarters
Broadcasting Department

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Regional Purchasing Office in Asia.

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:52.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the 2019 regional convention series,

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
95 percent
of the nearly 850,000 attendees

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had clear audio and video transmission
for the entire program.

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:05.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thank Jehovah so much

00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:07.602 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we can enjoy watching the videos,

00:04:07.602 --> 00:04:09.687 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
reports, experiences,

00:04:09.687 --> 00:04:12.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and music videos so clearly.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:14.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have a better experience

00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:16.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we get to know our Instructor more

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:18.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways that touch our heart.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Stream is an online tool

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:27.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was primarily designed
as a way for us to broadcast

00:04:27.247 --> 00:04:30.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything from large events
that might go to millions of people

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:33.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
down to small events
that would be seen by just a few.

00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:36.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, it’s our primary method of broadcast.

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:40.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can also be used to make online content
available on demand as needed.

00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:43.847 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
An example of this on-demand content

00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:46.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is recorded congregation meetings.

00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:50.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These recordings are made
for the benefit of the multi-language field.

00:04:50.562 --> 00:04:55.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Globally, groups as well as congregations
that might be small or isolated

00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are able to benefit from these meetings.

00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:03.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I can hear meetings from Thailand,

00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.577 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where the brothers use words and expressions

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:07.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touch my heart,

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:09.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps my faith get stronger.

00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:12.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like a tree that gets good fertilizer,

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:16.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which makes deep roots
that result in the tree progressing better.

00:05:17.631 --> 00:05:19.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to the hard work

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the World Headquarters
Broadcasting Department,

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:24.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible instruction is being transmitted

00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our theocratic events
like never before!

00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:32.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These spiritual programs
not only touch our hearts

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:34.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also draw us closer

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our “Grand Instructor,”
Jehovah God.

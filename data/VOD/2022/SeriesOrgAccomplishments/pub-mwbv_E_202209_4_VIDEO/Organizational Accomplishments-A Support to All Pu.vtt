WEBVTT

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
All over the world as Jehovah’s people,

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.163 line:10% position:50% align:center
we preach to all who will listen

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:20.374 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we receive loving support

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:22.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our congregations.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is the global preaching work
organized?

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do congregations stay united

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
around the world?

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Service Committee of the Governing Body
oversees these tasks.

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their responsibilities

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
are to oversee the preaching work,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
to oversee congregation organization,

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to oversee
the Hospital Liaison Committee arrangement.

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, consider how the Service Committee
supports you in the preaching work.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.249 line:10% position:50% align:center
Coordinating the worldwide preaching work

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.251 line:10% position:50% align:center
is an awesome privilege

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:05.628 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the Service Committee,

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we know that it was Jesus
who gave the commission

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “go, . . . and make disciples
of people of all the nations.”

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we recognize
that Jesus is the one in charge.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.477 line:10% position:50% align:center
A real effort is made

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:23.938 line:10% position:50% align:center
to provide assistance

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our brothers and sisters,
wherever they are,

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:30.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
can effectively fulfill
their personal ministry.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in recent years,
we’ve seen the introduction

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
of special metropolitan public witnessing,

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
prison witnessing,

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
harbor witnessing,

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reaching out to displaced individuals
—for example, individuals in refugee camps.

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:54.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
And depending on our schedule
or our circumstances,

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
opportunities to witness informally

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
may present the best way

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can fulfill our personal ministry.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well over 3,000 new disciples

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
are being baptized every week.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the preaching work
is being done in 239 lands

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
around the globe.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Service Committee works

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction of the Governing Body.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.708 line:10% position:50% align:center
We send significant matters

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.836 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the Governing Body for direction.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
An example is the establishing
of the Teaching Toolbox.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Service Committee

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.718 line:10% position:50% align:center
gives very close attention

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.137 line:10% position:50% align:center
to what publications would be considered

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
as basic tools for the ministry.

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because there are
relatively few of those, all of us

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
can become very well-acquainted with them.

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus we’re able to become very effective
in the ministry in preaching the good news

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in starting and conducting
productive Bible studies.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
A number of you are moving

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:01.076 line:10% position:50% align:center
to serve where the need is greater.

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:03.537 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many of you are simplifying your life

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in some cases, a number of you

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:09.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
are learning and adapting to new cultures.

00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:14.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many thousands have entered
into the pioneer service.

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this opens up other avenues of service,
such as serving where the need is greater,

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving on construction projects,

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:25.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even entering
into special full-time service.

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:28.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
A special full-time servant does not mean

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they themselves are special.

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is special

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:34.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the assignment they receive.

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those in special full-time service

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:40.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be assigned to serve
as a special pioneer or as a field missionary

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the circuit work.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:49.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need you young brothers and sisters
to set spiritual goals:

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go to SKE,

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
(for you young brothers) to qualify to be
ministerial servants and elders,

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:59.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (you sisters) to want to be
pioneers and missionaries

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:03.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to drive the work ahead worldwide.

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, when we see
your love for the preaching work,

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:09.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is so heartwarming for us.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what your circumstances,

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:14.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re doing your best
to share the good news.

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 14:33, 40

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us that Jehovah wants
things to be done ‘orderly’

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “by arrangement.”

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:38.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures confirm that the heavenly part
of Jehovah’s organization

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
is well-organized.

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:46.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
The earthly part must be as well.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our motto is,

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fast on principles and slow on rules.”

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:57.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
By holding to what is written
in the Scriptures,

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:00.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
we uphold Jehovah’s thinking,

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that we’re imperfect

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not infallible.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:08.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the Bible clearly says,

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:13.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are not ‘the masters over others’ faith.’

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:19.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters
are under much pressure these days.

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:21.967 line:10% position:50% align:center
There’s the spirit of the world,

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:23.844 line:10% position:50% align:center
there are health problems,

00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:26.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s persecution, and there are disasters.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the elders are there

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the brothers and sisters,
encouraging them

00:05:31.393 --> 00:05:34.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keeping the congregations clean.

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:39.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you dear elders and circuit overseers

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:43.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and respect you for the heavy load you carry.

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:50.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have congregations in over 200 lands

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:52.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in hundreds of languages,

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:57.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
so providing spiritual food
in the form of theocratic direction

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:00.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
that meets the needs
of the brothers and sisters worldwide

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:02.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not an easy task.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:05.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re in communication
with the branch offices

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
in over 80 lands.

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:12.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those brothers on the Branch Committees
are like eyes and ears

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Governing Body
and, as a result, we know what the needs are.

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Service Committee
sends out theocratic direction

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:24.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the Service Departments
in all the branch offices.

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:28.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as the Service Departments
get that information,

00:06:28.867 --> 00:06:30.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
they begin translating it,

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:32.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then they ensure that it’s distributed

00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:35.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
to some 7,000 circuit overseers

00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:40.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 700,000 elders worldwide.

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:42.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that that announcement

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:45.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that information
will then reach your congregation.

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:50.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jesus did with his disciples,

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:54.977 line:10% position:50% align:center
we want to do everything we can to help you

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:57.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out your personal ministry

00:06:57.145 --> 00:07:01.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the best of your abilities
and, of course, circumstances.

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:07.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
When making headquarters visits
or shepherding visits to the branches,

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:11.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
I keep in mind
that I’m visiting Jehovah’s sheep

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:14.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they have to be cared for and fed.

00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:17.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very similar to the excitement

00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:20.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s generated when congregations
have the visit of their circuit overseer.

00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:24.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
That same excitement is generated,
albeit on a larger scale,

00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:28.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
when representatives come to the branches.

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:32.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows for that personal interaction

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you can correspond with the branches
to give them the encouragement they need

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:38.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
with things
that they may need assistance with.

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:43.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has a tremendous unifying effect.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you dear brothers
for your self-sacrificing spirit

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:50.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the hard work that you do.

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:52.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that you’re doing Jehovah’s work,

00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:55.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know that it’s not always easy.

00:07:55.954 --> 00:07:58.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wherever we go in the world,

00:07:58.248 --> 00:08:01.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see the love
that you brothers and sisters have

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:04.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah and for the preaching work.

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:08.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we see what you’re willing to do
for Jehovah, it warms our hearts

00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:11.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encourages us to keep going.

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:18.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work of the Hospital Liaison Committees

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
is something that is very precious.

00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we need help,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization is there
to provide it.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us become

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.655 line:10% position:50% align:center
better acquainted

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:33.575 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the Hospital Liaison Committee arrangement,

00:08:33.575 --> 00:08:35.827 line:10% position:50% align:center
we should all take a look at the video

00:08:35.827 --> 00:08:38.997 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>A Loving Provision for Times of Distress.</i>

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:45.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing more frightening
than learning that we have a serious disease

00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:48.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
or learning that a loved one
has been in a serious accident.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given us the HLC arrangement

00:08:52.219 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide the comfort,
the encouragement, and the strength

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a family, we were doing
very well spiritually.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:12.283 line:10% position:50% align:center
We did family worship, went preaching,

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:15.202 line:10% position:50% align:center
and went to the meetings together.

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some time, we began

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encounter financial problems.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we did not even have money
to buy food

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:26.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each day.

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:31.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in our area
were going to South Africa

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide basic needs for their families.

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to go as well,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving behind my wife
to take care of our seven children.

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
This affected me spiritually

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:56.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I did not know the language,
I was unable to preach,

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being so far from my family

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused me to neglect
my responsibility as a family head.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we all missed each other very much.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I had made
a wrong decision going abroad.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I remembered the example of Baruch

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Jeremiah 45:5.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch may have wanted
to pursue material riches as I had.

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was helped, he returned.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of searching for material things.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started to make changes to go home

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help my family spiritually.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I left South Africa
and reached the border of Malawi

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
(after leaving my family
for about six months),

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt great happiness in my heart,

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:06.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am still happy till now.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:10.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still encounter financial problems,

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I remember that in Satanâ€™s world,

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is nowhere we can go
and have no problems.

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I serve as an elder.

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family is progressing spiritually.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this makes me very happy,

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my relationship
with Jehovah is strong.

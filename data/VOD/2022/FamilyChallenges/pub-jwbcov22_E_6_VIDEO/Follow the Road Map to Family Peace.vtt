00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:04.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irene.

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww,

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
you look so handsome there.

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you look beautiful.

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:13.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those came out so nice.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at you.

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:18.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Crazy, right?

00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:19.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the day!

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:21.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at us.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:23.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so surprised.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just knew you were going to do it.

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, Olivia.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:27.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:28.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s OK, Sue.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:30.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, I’m all moved in.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the last box.

00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:37.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, are those the wedding photos?

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:37.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:00:37.643 --> 00:00:38.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:40.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look it. Here’s . . .

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you all look beautiful.

00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:43.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
That dress looks so nice.

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:43.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
You look so good.

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:45.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, look at you.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, that suits you.

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:49.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice, you guys.

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:50.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it all came together.

00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:52.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really did.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia?

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:10.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know this is all new, baby.

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:12.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I cut in?

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong?

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:51.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the desk?

00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:53.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to get rid of it.

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:55.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one is better for everyone.

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:57.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mean it’s better for him!

00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:00.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Max?

00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:01.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:02.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you care?

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t talk to me like that. Get back here!

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Olivia, what do you think
about the desk?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come here, sweetie. Come here.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you never forget that I love you.

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:56.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you like it.

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:11.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK, Mom.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:13.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
You didn’t know.

00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:16.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad did that for her just before he died.

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:22.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anything I can do to help?

00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:30.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 12:10:

00:03:30.823 --> 00:03:35.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:45.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia?

00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:50.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made your favorite tonight.

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:55.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:06.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell you
that I didn’t handle that so well today.

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
You had good reason
to be upset about the desk.

00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:17.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, you didn’t know.

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just one of those things
that Dad did just for me.

00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:28.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know he’s my stepdad now, but

00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:32.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just wish he would have checked first.

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:34.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t Max.

00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:36.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:04:36.892 --> 00:04:41.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to surprise Max
with a place for him to do his work.

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:48.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he didn’t make you get rid of the desk?

00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:49.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:53.284 --> 00:04:56.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought you both didn’t care.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:01.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will never ever stop caring about you.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:25.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Steve.

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:29.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I’m sorry I was late to the meeting.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should have been there
to help out with my assignment.

00:05:35.494 --> 00:05:37.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we got delayed.

00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:42.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re late!

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go, kids!

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:49.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re coming! Sorry!

00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:53.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, the family is fine.

00:05:53.388 --> 00:05:56.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody is adjusting really well.

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone seen my glasses?

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:06.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone?

00:06:10.906 --> 00:06:12.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we might be a little out of sync,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t know

00:06:16.203 --> 00:06:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every family has their issues, right?

00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
You going outside in those?

00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:28.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:32.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, well, thanks for understanding.

00:06:32.888 --> 00:06:33.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:35.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Take care.

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:37.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, bye-bye.

00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:13.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:16.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all have to work on it. I know I need to.

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we approach it that way
with the kids

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just be open with them?

00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:24.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds like a good idea.

00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:29.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. So Irene and I have been talking about

00:07:29.863 --> 00:07:31.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
communication

00:07:31.907 --> 00:07:33.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our family.

00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:36.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to talk
about our phones and other devices.

00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:39.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not talking about me, are you?

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t do that.

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:40.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no.

00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that we can all be
more balanced, but . . .

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need it.

00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:44.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re joking, right? You mean them.

00:07:44.754 --> 00:07:45.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t take them away.

00:07:45.546 --> 00:07:46.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t done anything bad.

00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:47.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have responsibilities.

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:48.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:49.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re always on your phone too.

00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:50.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:51.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

00:07:51.594 --> 00:07:54.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just talk about it, all right?

00:07:56.057 --> 00:07:57.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sue,

00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:02.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you read Ephesians 5:15, 16
for us, please?

00:08:05.609 --> 00:08:08.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So keep strict watch that how you walk

00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:12.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is not as unwise but as wise persons,

00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:16.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the best use of your time,
because the days are wicked.”

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:19.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think we’re doing
with our phones and other devices?

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t that what you’re doing
on your devices is wrong.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could it be taking time away
from more important things

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like talking to each other,

00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:47.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in that way affecting even
how we’re talking to each other?

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:58.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think it’d be smart

00:08:58.497 --> 00:09:00.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have some boundaries then.

00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:07.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, OK.

00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:10.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:13.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about how we can do that.

00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:20.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Olivia.

00:09:21.938 --> 00:09:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:26.068 --> 00:09:28.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, I haven’t figured out
how to talk to her about her clothes yet.

00:09:28.487 --> 00:09:28.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:30.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need your help.

00:09:30.906 --> 00:09:32.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got this one.

00:09:36.996 --> 00:09:38.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know,

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:41.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s all about good spiritual judgment.

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:45.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that these trends reflect
Jehovah’s view of “respectable dress”?

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that you’ll do the right thing.

00:09:54.514 --> 00:09:55.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:09:56.016 --> 00:09:57.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Gabe, can you take us?

00:09:57.392 --> 00:09:59.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course. Mm-hmm.

00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:02.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we’re all here,

00:10:02.898 --> 00:10:05.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know we all have
different views on punctuality,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:10:07.778 --> 00:10:09.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really need your help

00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:12.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can take care
of some of my responsibilities.

00:10:13.617 --> 00:10:15.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:10:16.996 --> 00:10:17.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:10:17.621 --> 00:10:18.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. Great.

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:46.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last few weeks of family worship
have been nice,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
right?

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:49.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:50.531 --> 00:10:53.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these things we ask and pray
in Jesus’ name, Amen.

00:10:54.243 --> 00:10:55.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.

00:10:58.956 --> 00:10:59.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, this week . . .

00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:02.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are in chapter 5.

00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:04.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yep, that’s right.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last week, Gabe read, so this week . . .

00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:07.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Sue’s turn.

00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:11.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right. It’s Sue’s turn.

00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:14.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, the point here is
that when it comes . . .

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:17.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honey, maybe an illustration would be better.

00:11:19.144 --> 00:11:22.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, OK.

00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like a bird . . .

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:27.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, hopefully I was able to clear that up
for you a little bit, Olivia.

00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:28.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thank you.

00:11:29.363 --> 00:11:32.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, actually, Max, that’s not true.

00:11:32.032 --> 00:11:35.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had an updated understanding
in the recent <i>Watchtower.</i>

00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:38.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think they went really well, right?

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, actually . . .

00:11:54.722 --> 00:11:55.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:11:58.309 --> 00:12:00.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we can talk about it later.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:02.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:12:29.258 --> 00:12:30.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Want some tea?

00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:32.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:12:39.352 --> 00:12:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, babe,

00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
you and me, we’re a team, right?

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:49.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read this, I thought about us.

00:12:53.116 --> 00:12:57.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.”

00:12:59.623 --> 00:13:04.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that before, you had to shoulder
everything yourself for so long.

00:13:04.337 --> 00:13:04.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:13:05.004 --> 00:13:06.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you did great.

00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:11.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been raising two beautiful,
spiritual kids on your own.

00:13:13.346 --> 00:13:14.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now you have me.

00:13:15.098 --> 00:13:16.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.

00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:20.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do you think
sometimes we’re not a team?

00:13:20.937 --> 00:13:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s just that sometimes
during family worship . . .

00:13:23.315 --> 00:13:26.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
I get excited, and I jump in. I know!

00:13:27.068 --> 00:13:29.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just so used to doing it
after all these years.

00:13:30.364 --> 00:13:32.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re not trying to take over.

00:13:32.282 --> 00:13:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
And listen, I love the way you teach.

00:13:34.701 --> 00:13:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see how you can reach the kids

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that I can’t.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just let me guide it,
and I’ll make sure you can do that.

00:13:44.628 --> 00:13:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, honey. Thanks for your patience.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, thank you for your patience.

00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:54.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a work in progress,
but we make a great team.

00:13:56.015 --> 00:13:59.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we look at what we’re going
to cover before our next family worship?

00:14:00.353 --> 00:14:01.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds great.

00:14:09.696 --> 00:14:10.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:12.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, babe.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s for family worship this week?

00:14:23.586 --> 00:14:25.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I got some good ideas.

00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:26.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:27.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:29.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for reading that.

00:14:29.717 --> 00:14:30.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um.

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:36.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just go ahead and ask the question.
We’ll just do that.

00:14:36.057 --> 00:14:39.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
So paragraphs 13 and 14:
“How can we be generous?”

00:14:41.855 --> 00:14:43.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anybody?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the footnote that we just read
really helps us to appreciate

00:14:49.696 --> 00:14:52.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
the definition of that quality.

00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:55.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the definition, we’re left to wonder

00:14:55.369 --> 00:14:58.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
exactly what it is
and how it connects to the other things

00:14:58.372 --> 00:15:00.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve discussed this evening.

00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:05.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe, can you go ahead
and read the next one for us?

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:15:06.797 --> 00:15:08.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:14.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains many examples
of submissive individuals.

00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:17.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are there examples?

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:22.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sue.

00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:23.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:27.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we talk about examples,
where do we start?

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are examples in the past;

00:15:29.821 --> 00:15:32.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are even examples presently.

00:15:32.574 --> 00:15:37.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we could even be examples.

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s—that’s the power of them.

00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:46.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep going.

00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:55.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a lot of reading.

00:15:55.932 --> 00:15:57.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:15:57.684 --> 00:16:00.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to enjoy family worship, but

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:03.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like the things that we are covering

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
are just really not what I need right now.

00:16:08.028 --> 00:16:09.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:13.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, I just don’t know
if this is what they need right now.

00:16:13.992 --> 00:16:15.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:17.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll keep working on it.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
March 15, 2014, <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Family Worship
—Can you Make It More Enjoyable?”:

00:16:38.267 --> 00:16:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The worship of Jehovah
should not be boring. . . .

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:46.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Address the needs of each family member.”

00:16:50.238 --> 00:16:52.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babe, what do our kids need?

00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:56.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s actually going on in their lives?

00:16:57.204 --> 00:16:59.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family worship needs to include that.

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:04.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe we need to pay more attention
to what’s going on with them.

00:17:05.504 --> 00:17:08.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to them; listen to them.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to send you a link
to a great <i>Watchtower</i>  article.

00:17:13.804 --> 00:17:15.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to read it.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Max and I changed our approach.

00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:27.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
We found out what mattered to our kids

00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:30.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like friends,

00:17:33.074 --> 00:17:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . adjusting to a blended family,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . dating.

00:17:46.505 --> 00:17:48.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we turned things around
and used family worship

00:17:48.674 --> 00:17:52.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on what our kids really needed

00:18:06.317 --> 00:18:08.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prepare ourselves
for possible future trials.

00:18:24.128 --> 00:18:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night, y’all.

00:18:25.087 --> 00:18:26.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:28.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:18:28.632 --> 00:18:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um,

00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:33.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
family worship was—was cool.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:35.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad you liked it.

00:18:37.934 --> 00:18:39.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:39.227 --> 00:18:40.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night, y’all.

00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:41.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Night.

00:18:41.062 --> 00:18:42.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:18:42.814 --> 00:18:44.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey! Guess what?

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:45.942 --> 00:18:46.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:47.652 --> 00:18:49.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
I applied to Bethel.

00:18:49.571 --> 00:18:50.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did?

00:18:50.822 --> 00:18:51.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:53.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s really exciting.

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:56.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m proud of you.

00:18:56.912 --> 00:18:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, congratulations.

00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, it’s selfie time, everybody.
Come on, let’s get together.

00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:11.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. On three
we’re going to say Bethel, OK?

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:12.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:19:12.803 --> 00:19:15.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
One, two, three.

00:19:15.514 --> 00:19:17.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethel!

00:19:36.828 --> 00:19:39.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve come a long way.

00:19:51.093 --> 00:19:52.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
And through it all,

00:19:52.845 --> 00:19:54.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has taught us to love

00:19:56.182 --> 00:19:58.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given our family

00:19:58.684 --> 00:20:00.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace.

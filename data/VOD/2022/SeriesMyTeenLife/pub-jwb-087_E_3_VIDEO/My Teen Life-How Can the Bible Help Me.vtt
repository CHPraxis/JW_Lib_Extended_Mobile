00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My parents were both Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by the time I was born.

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I studied the Bible,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended meetings,
and went out in service with them.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in the truth, I knew

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that living by Bible standards
is what’s best for me.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my parents were always so zealous

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it came to spiritual things.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:31.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I think back,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t want to let them down.

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following Bible principles is not burdensome

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even that difficult.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, if we do as it says in the Bible,
then we benefit ourselves.

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, I was curious

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how my life would be
if I wasn’t in the truth.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just so fun
to be around my school friends.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overall, I had a good time at school.

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got along with my classmates, 
and my teachers liked me too.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So being in school
was a pretty good experience.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents always told me
not to get too close to my classmates,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in my opinion, my friends

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had good conduct and were good people.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t understand why they were so worried.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my high school,

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:23.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were a lot of kids who went to church

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of the teachers
had religious backgrounds.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, there was an incident
when the entire school found out

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:32.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:34.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that some people might be prejudiced

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Witnesses, but I was surprised

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how everyone could change so suddenly.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:43.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started spending more time
with my classmates,

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the more I hung out with them,
the more I saw

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we were living
completely different lives.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:52.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their conversations would be
about trips they went on over the weekend

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they bought
on their latest shopping trip, 

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when it came to me,
all I had done was spiritual activities.

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like I was missing out.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt alone and like an outcast.

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew in my head that Bible principles
are right and beneficial,

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when I was
actually put in that situation,

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t so sure anymore.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to feel like I wasn’t as cool
as my classmates,

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so when they started to talk
about their life goals,

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t bring myself to tell them
what my goals were.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started thinking,

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What would be the right way for me to act?’

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:36.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Opening up to my parents
about my situation really helped.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day for family worship, we decided

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discuss that topic.

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Matthew 5:11:

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people reproach you
and persecute you

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:52.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against you for my sake.”

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you be happy when persecuted?

00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:00.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought to myself,
‘But I’m not happy right now.’

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom shared Mark 8:38 with me.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The part in the scripture where it says

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we are ashamed of Jesus Christ,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will be ashamed of us

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really hit me.

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that deep inside

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had been ashamed of being a Witness.

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I was going through all of this,

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother gave
a public talk in our congregation

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read Matthew 19:29.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:27.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says that everyone who has left

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:29.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is important to them
“for the sake of [Jehovah]

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive a hundred times as much.”

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to try leaving
what I thought was important to me

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing what results
and blessings I might receive.

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About that time,

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents helped me to associate
with brothers and sisters

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:49.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were participating
in many different forms of full-time service

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could hear their experiences.

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:54.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helped me to decide

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which direction I wanted to go in my life.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that was really great
about this decision

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that I was able to meet
many new brothers and sisters.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that there were so many people

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had the same thoughts and goals as I did.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were my true friends.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time the topic of our future goals
came up with my classmates,

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:18.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to speak up confidently.

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am really thankful to my parents

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helped me to find the courage to do that.

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve felt that Jehovah
truly keeps his promises.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come to think of it,

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has kept his promise to reward me

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a hundred times as much

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I choose to live
by the Bible’s principles.

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am really happy now,

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:46.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am confident that if I follow
the Bible’s teachings when I make decisions,

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will always have the best results.

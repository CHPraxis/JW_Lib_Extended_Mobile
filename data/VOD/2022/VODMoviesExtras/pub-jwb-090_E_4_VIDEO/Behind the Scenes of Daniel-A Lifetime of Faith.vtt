The Bible book of Daniel

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is filled with imagery,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visions,

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and amazing scenery and architecture.

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of it serves

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach readers about the times we live in now

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can faithfully serve Jehovah.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The team that made 

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith</i>

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:40.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to portray these amazing things on film.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they do it?

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:46.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early concept art

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was made to help in the development

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the many visual effects scenes.

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The architecture and aesthetics of Babylon

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were quite different

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from what the Israelites were used to.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sets needed to be designed in a way

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped convey
what it was like to be captured

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brought to a foreign land.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The production design and sets

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:32.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and props departments built 360-degree sets,

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made for an immersive environment.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the other wise men are unable to make
the interpretation known to me.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you are able to do so.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many costumes and props

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were carefully handmade for the production.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spearheads were hand-forged.

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the filming was done

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:20.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some additional scenes
were filmed in nearby locations

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Florida.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to rest.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several miniature sets were built,

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:46.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including a ziggurat,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then actors were filmed
in front of a green screen

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inserted into the final shots.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As filming was completed,
scenes were edited together

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the visual-effects team

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:08.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to work on many specialized shots.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Digital models of people and animals

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:19.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were animated and combined

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:21.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with footage of real environments

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make scenes

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would have been impossible to film otherwise.

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:28.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a digital model was made of the immense image

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:33.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The team researched the characteristics

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the actual materials described
in the Scriptures,

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:43.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as metals and rocks,

00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when the image falls,

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:47.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it appears realistic and believable.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:06.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at the results of thousands of hours

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spent modeling,

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
animating, simulating,

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:15.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rendering, and compositing!

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:35.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Music and sound effects add the final touches.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you see?”

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:52.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah asked the prophet Amos.

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:58.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Amos saw taught him important lessons.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the drama <i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith,</i>

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you see?

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:15.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more important, what did you learn?

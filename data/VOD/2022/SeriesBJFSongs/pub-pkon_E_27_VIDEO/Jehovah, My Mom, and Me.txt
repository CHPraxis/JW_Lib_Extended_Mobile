00:00:14 My mom works hard ev’ry day. She takes good care of me.
00:00:23 We always find time to pray. It makes us happy.
00:00:31 My heart is full of love In my family of three.
00:00:40 Together, we can do anything— Jehovah, my mom, and me.
00:01:00 Before we both go to bed, We read Bible stories.
00:01:08 Timothy’s my fav’rite ’Cause he’s just like me.
00:01:17 His mom taught him the truth And made him firm in his beliefs.
00:01:25 Like Timothy, I have what I need— Jehovah, my mom, and me.
00:01:45 What can I do with a gift so great? I can listen carefully.
00:02:03 Every day I can show I appreciate my family— Jehovah, my mom, and me.

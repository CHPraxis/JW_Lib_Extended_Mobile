At our convention, they had the meeting
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:16.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:17.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Gabriel.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hi, Anton.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you coming?

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, to what?

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The SKE meeting.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, no.

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t planning on it,

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all right, yeah, sure.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, then, and afterward, I can . . .

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went, but I felt conflicted.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I already have an assignment,
one that I love.’

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t fully understand
the incredible privilege of attending SKE.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked the circuit overseer
a few more questions.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt like, this is it!

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:59.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed right,
and all I had to do was apply online.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:03.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was months ago.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s holding you back?

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like Jehovah led me here,

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve never been happier.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now another door has opened,
and the fear is back.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how far you’ve come.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear of the unknown can be overwhelming.

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is leading you in the right direction.

00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:28.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one to keep in mind

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Philippians 4:13.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read it, and just think
about how far Jehovah has taken you.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in control.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was I so afraid of?

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, SKE is for two months.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re just alike you two,

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing every last thing with you.

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I—can I leave this with you?

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been on a few adventures,
but it’s still great for traveling.

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:53.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, please.

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows, you might need it sometime soon.

00:00:04 Hi, darling, we’re back.
00:00:06 When I learned that I was invited to work
00:00:08 for a few weeks on the upcoming construction project, I was thrilled.
00:00:13 But that excitement quickly turned into anxiety
00:00:17 because of what I had to do.
00:00:24 I prayed to Jehovah for weeks to give me the strength
00:00:28 to have the conversation with my employer.
00:00:31 All right, Sarah, come in!
00:00:43 So?
00:00:44 I wanted to, first of all, say thank you
00:00:46 for taking the time to meet with me, . . .
00:00:49 I began to explain about the construction project
00:00:51 and how I had been invited to volunteer.
00:00:53 . . . and I would really like the time to . . .
00:00:54 So you want time off
00:00:57 during the busiest time of our year?
00:01:02 Well, yes, but . . .
00:01:04 It’s your choice, but under no circumstances will I hold your position.
00:01:13 Suddenly, this beautiful privilege felt like a huge risk.
00:01:19 Was I making my life more complicated by doing this?
00:01:37 I read the account about the people in Nehemiah’s day.
00:01:42 Their willing spirit demonstrated faith,
00:01:45 and Jerusalem’s walls were built by people
00:01:48 who “put their heart into the work.”
00:01:55 I didn’t want to miss out
00:01:57 on the opportunity to serve Jehovah in that way.
00:02:00 This is my resignation letter.
00:02:06 I had to have faith that Jehovah would bless my decision.
00:02:11 I’m not sure what the future holds when I get back,
00:02:15 but I know Jehovah will take care of me.
00:02:22 For now, I’m going to focus
00:02:25 on putting my heart into the work.

Hi, darling, we’re back. 

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:08.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I learned that I was invited to work

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:13.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a few weeks on the upcoming
construction project, I was thrilled.

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that excitement
quickly turned into anxiety

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what I had to do.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah for weeks
to give me the strength

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the conversation with my employer.

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Sarah, come in!

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:44.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, first of all, say thank you

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking the time to meet with me, . . .

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to explain
about the construction project

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I had been invited to volunteer.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I would
really like the time to . . .

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you want time off

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the busiest time of our year?

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, but . . .

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your choice, but under no circumstances
will I hold your position.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege
felt like a huge risk.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was I making my life
more complicated by doing this?

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the account
about the people in Nehemiah’s day.

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their willing spirit demonstrated faith,

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jerusalem’s walls were built by people

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “put their heart into the work.”

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to miss out

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the opportunity
to serve Jehovah in that way.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my resignation letter.

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have faith that Jehovah
would bless my decision.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure what the future holds
when I get back,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I know Jehovah will take care of me.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For now, I’m going to focus

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on putting my heart into the work.

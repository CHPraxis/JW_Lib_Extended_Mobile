When a disaster struck
in the north of the country,

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we immediately answered the call for help.

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing our brothers and sisters
in need was heartbreaking.

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what really touched our heart
was the spirit

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the local brothers and sisters.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like the Macedonians.

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have much,
but they gave generously from the heart.

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got home,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Madeline and I resolved
to show the same kind of spirit.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our appreciation led us

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to review our contribution
to the worldwide work.

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve come up with this figure.

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this right?

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just thank Jehovah.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We looked for ways to be generous

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those around us.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discovered that we had

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the means to give more,
so we didn’t hold back.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then,
our congregation was invited to help

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a special preaching campaign.

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . reach as many
as possible with the good news.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think we could do a bit more?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d really like to.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was within our power to help,

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s exactly what we did!

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much?

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:52.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not.

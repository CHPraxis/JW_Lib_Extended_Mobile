00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:27.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t remember when our routine service day

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
became so,

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
well,

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
routine.

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:44.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal wasn’t what it used to be.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were finally starting to notice.

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone wants to listen.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t want to be the reason.

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:17.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t take much research to find

00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:20.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
great ideas
and set a few simple goals, . . .

00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:26.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . like working with those
who encourage us.

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:31.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Ryota and Ami, we’re always talking

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:34.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how we can reach the heart.

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:36.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got back to basics:

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be friendly,

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:42.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen,

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:46.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
let the conversation progress naturally,

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:49.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to share an appealing Scriptural thought,

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:56.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep trying.

00:01:56.064 --> 00:01:58.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal

00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
can attract an honest person

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:02.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the truth.

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:17.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d made some good changes,

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:21.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we weren’t done.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Yuri what she planned to talk about.

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:30.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
That started the usual scramble.

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:35.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we got it—the sample conversation.

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:37.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll do.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for that to work,
I had to remember the scripture.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were both a little forgetful that morning.

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:11.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:19.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d been relying on our experience

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not enough on Jehovah.

00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:27.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first we prepared our hearts.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:33.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we prepared our minds

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:41.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found new ways
to use our preaching tools.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even a little preparation for initial calls

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our returns visits

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
went a long way.

00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:31.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seemed nice.

00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew what Yuri was thinking.

00:04:36.948 --> 00:04:39.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to start a conversation,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t want to bother them either.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when an opportunity came,

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just froze.

00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:10.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was in a rush to give a witness.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:26.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt forced.

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:37.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped to hear that we’d all been there.

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:39.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our past experiences were similar.

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:49.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever we didn’t put pressure on ourselves

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just looked for something in common
to talk about,

00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could usually find a moment
when we could say something about the Bible.

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:01.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was curious why we were dressed up.

00:06:03.418 --> 00:06:05.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turns out that she’d never talked

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:07.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s Witnesses before.

00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:22.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ami left a great question for her next visit.

00:06:27.277 --> 00:06:30.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Return visit! Mrs. Iwata!

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:34.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her I’d visit this morning.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t schedule the time.

00:06:39.373 --> 00:06:41.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could at least stop by on the way back.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
I missed her again.

00:06:59.103 --> 00:07:01.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I didn’t try something different,

00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:04.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just going to keep missing her.

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:09.156 line:10% position:50% align:center
First, I wanted her

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:11.700 line:10% position:50% align:center
to know I hadn’t forgotten her.

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:30.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear Mrs. Iwata,

00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:32.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you’re doing well.

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:34.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise to come by early next week.

00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:38.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, your flowers are so beautiful!

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:46.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I made a plan for my service day.

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:06.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following through is just too important

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
to leave to chance.

00:08:16.688 --> 00:08:19.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mrs. Iwata was doing great.

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were already on Lesson 10.

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really hoped she’d come to a meeting soon.

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:31.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about Hebrews 10:24, 25

00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:36.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and watched the video.

00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:45.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I miss something?

00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:48.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I did.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was too focused
on our progress with the lessons

00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:58.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of her progress and what she needed.

00:09:04.908 --> 00:09:09.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Iwata said going to meetings
would dishonor the family.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted her to quit the study.

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:16.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
She didn’t want to quit,

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:20.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
but whenever she tried to talk about it,
they argued.

00:09:21.134 --> 00:09:23.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
We showed her where to look for help

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:25.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made time during our studies

00:09:25.972 --> 00:09:28.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk about it more.

00:09:48.372 --> 00:09:52.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all prayed for Jehovah

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:54.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bless her efforts.

00:09:58.424 --> 00:10:01.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did our best
to share the good news of peace,

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:12.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah did the rest.

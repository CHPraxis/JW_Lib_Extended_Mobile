Have you ever been
the victim of oppression or injustice?

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.701 line:10% position:50% align:center
Have you been angered by something

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
someone has said or done?

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us hasn’t?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
In situations like that,

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who don’t know Jehovah

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
often react in a way
that’s far from peaceful.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
They retaliate; they fight;

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
they hit back.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know that Jehovah
sees what happened,

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he can set matters straight.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re wise to remember the words of Jesus:

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the mild-tempered.”

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the peacemakers.”

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible describes a man
who remained mild and peaceable

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some extremely difficult
and stressful situations.

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Repeatedly, he chose not to fight,

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:05.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
preferring a course that led to peace.

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
That man was Jacob.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob learned from the peaceful example

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his father, Isaac.

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a famine in the land,

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:20.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Isaac moved his family to Gerar,

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was ruled by Abimelech,
king of the Philistines.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about the problems that arose

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Isaac dealt with them.

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Genesis 26:12.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Isaac began to sow seed in that land,

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in that year he reaped
100 times what he sowed,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah was blessing him.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The man became wealthy,

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he continued to prosper
until he became very wealthy.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:01.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He acquired flocks of sheep
and herds of cattle

00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a large body of servants,

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Philistines began to envy him.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the Philistines took soil

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and stopped up all the wells
that his father’s servants had dug

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the days of Abraham.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abimelech then said to Isaac:

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Move from our neighborhood,
for you have grown far stronger than we are.’

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Isaac moved from there
and encamped in the valley of Gerar

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and began dwelling there.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Isaac again dug the wells

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had been dug
in the days of his father Abraham

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:43.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that the Philistines had stopped up
after Abraham’s death,

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he called them by the names
that his father had given them.

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the servants of Isaac
were digging in the valley,

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they found a well of fresh water.

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the shepherds of Gerar

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“began quarreling
with the shepherds of Isaac, saying:

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:04.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The water is ours!’

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he named the well Esek,

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they had quarreled with him.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they started digging another well,

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they began quarreling over it also.

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he named it Sitnah.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Later he moved away from there
and dug another well,

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they did not quarrel over it.

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he named it Rehoboth and said:

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:33.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is because now Jehovah
has given us ample room

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and has made us fruitful in the land.’

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he went up from there to Beersheba.

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:44.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That night Jehovah appeared to him and said:

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:47.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am the God of your father Abraham.

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not be afraid, for I am with you,

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and I will bless you
and multiply your offspring

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
on account of Abraham my servant.’”

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:02.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Philistines, motivated by envy,

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:06.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
stop up all the wells that Abraham had dug,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the king asks Isaac
to move from the neighborhood.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac now has a decision to make.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps some encourage him to stay put.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:21.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how they might have reasoned:

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’ve done nothing wrong, Isaac.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah told you that you and your offspring

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘would possess the land.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You have nothing to fear.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You have many servants,

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and they’re stronger than the Philistines.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why not hit back

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:43.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
against those who have done this
to your wells?’

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this situation, what would you have done?

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:51.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac chooses a peaceful course.

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:54.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
He decides to move on.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not easy.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac has many servants

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has tilled the ground and planted seed,

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s produced plentifully,

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:16.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he leaves that behind and moves on.

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Isaac’s troubles are not over.

00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:24.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his new location, his servants dig wells

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:27.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find fresh water.

00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:29.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the shepherds in that area say:

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:32.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The water is ours!”

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac then digs another well,

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:39.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the local shepherds
quarrel about that one too.

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:43.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, instead of fighting over the matter,

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:48.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac moves and finally finds a place

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he can reside in peace.

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:56.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob saw that his father’s peaceful actions

00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:58.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a good effect,

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:03.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knew that Isaac
had received Jehovah’s blessing.

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:06.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:11.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, never underestimate
the powerful effect

00:06:11.516 --> 00:06:15.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
your good example can have on your children.

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob has a twin brother, Esau.

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:24.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of the two, Esau is born first,

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:28.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah foretells
that—contrary to custom—

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:33.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
the older Esau will serve
his younger brother.

00:06:34.081 --> 00:06:38.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah foresees
what kind of personalities they’ll develop,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knows that Esau
will have little appreciation

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritual matters.

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:47.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
This becomes evident

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:51.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Esau exchanges his right as firstborn

00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:54.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a mere bowl of stew,

00:06:54.685 --> 00:06:57.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
sealing the matter with an oath.

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:01.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
But something more is involved.

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:06.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
In selling the birthright,
he also gives up the right

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:10.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive a prophetic blessing
from his father.

00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:15.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years pass, Isaac has grown old,

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:18.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he decides it’s time to impart

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:21.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
the blessing to his firstborn.

00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:25.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may not know
that Esau had sold his right as firstborn.

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any case, he tells Esau
that he will bless him

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
but asks him first

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide him with a tasty dish

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:39.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
of fresh game from the field.

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:45.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah, the twins’ mother,
overhears this conversation

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persuades Jacob
to impersonate his twin brother

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
while Esau is out hunting.

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:55.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
The plan is successful.

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:59.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac unwittingly blesses Jacob!

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:03.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esau, at learning of this, is furious.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take up the account

00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:10.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Genesis 27:41.

00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Esau harbored
animosity against Jacob

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:19.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of the blessing
his father had given him,

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Esau kept saying in his heart:

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:27.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The days of mourning for my father
are getting closer.

00:08:27.778 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that I am going to kill
Jacob my brother.’

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:36.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the words of her older son Esau
were told to Rebekah,

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:40.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“she at once sent for her younger son Jacob

00:08:40.248 --> 00:08:43.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to him: ‘Look!

00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:47.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Your brother Esau is planning
to take revenge by killing you.

00:08:47.464 --> 00:08:50.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now, my son, do as I say.

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:54.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Get up and run away
to my brother Laban at Haran.

00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:56.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Dwell with him for a while

00:08:56.598 --> 00:09:00.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘until your brother’s rage calms down,

00:09:00.018 --> 00:09:03.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘until your brother’s anger
toward you subsides

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:07.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and he forgets what you have done to him.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:10.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Then I will send for you from there.

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:14.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why should I lose both of you in one day?’

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:18.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that Rebekah kept saying to Isaac:

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:23.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am disgusted with my life
because of the daughters of Heth.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:26.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If Jacob ever takes a wife
from the daughters of Heth,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘like these daughters of the land,

00:09:28.922 --> 00:09:31.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what good is my life?’

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Isaac called Jacob

00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:37.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and blessed him and commanded him, saying:

00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:41.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must not take a wife
from the daughters of Canaan.

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:43.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go away to Paddanaram

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:46.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to the house of Bethuel,
your mother’s father,

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and from there take for yourself a wife

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:53.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘from the daughters of Laban,
your mother’s brother.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:58.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God Almighty will bless you
and make you fruitful and multiply you,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will certainly become
a congregation of peoples.

00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:05.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And he will give to you
the blessing of Abraham,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:07.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to you and to your offspring with you,

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:12.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that you may take possession of the land
where you have been living as a foreigner,

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:15.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which God has given to Abraham.’

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:18.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Isaac sent Jacob away,

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:21.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he departed for Paddanaram,

00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:24.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramaean,

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:28.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother of Rebekah,
the mother of Jacob and Esau.”

00:10:30.108 --> 00:10:34.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob’s parents tell him to travel
to his uncle, Laban,

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:36.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find a wife.

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:39.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the core issue

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the problem with Esau.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that earlier,
Isaac had a problem with the Philistines

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:51.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a problem that evidently
could not be settled peacefully.

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:55.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did Isaac do?

00:10:55.008 --> 00:10:57.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
He moved on.

00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:01.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now Jacob faces a similar situation.

00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:04.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
His brother is seething with anger,

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:08.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Jacob leaves.

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:11.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means leaving his home and his family;

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:16.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means making a long journey
to a distant land.

00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:21.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob could have chosen to stand his ground.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:23.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
He owns the birthright.

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:26.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could argue the matter
with his father and mother:

00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m no child. I’m 77 years old!’

00:11:31.419 --> 00:11:34.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob does none of those things.

00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible simply says:

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob obeyed his father and his mother

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and departed.”

00:11:42.597 --> 00:11:44.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:47.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face a situation

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:50.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can’t be settled peacefully,

00:11:50.438 --> 00:11:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
we probably won’t need to flee for our lives
to a distant land.

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:59.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes, however,
it is the course of wisdom

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:03.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
to walk away from a situation.

00:12:03.493 --> 00:12:07.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 17:14 says:

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:12.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beginning a fight
is like opening a floodgate;

00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:16.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the quarrel breaks out,
take your leave.”

00:12:18.383 --> 00:12:21.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
While Jacob is on his way to his uncle,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah appears to Jacob in a dream

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:29.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assures him
of his support and protection.

00:12:30.437 --> 00:12:32.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
That does not mean

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:35.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jacob’s troubles are over.

00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:40.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the journey’s end,
he moves in with his uncle’s household.

00:12:40.322 --> 00:12:44.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, a situation arises again

00:12:44.492 --> 00:12:46.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows that Jacob

00:12:46.494 --> 00:12:49.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a man who loves peace.

00:12:49.914 --> 00:12:54.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about it from Genesis 29:16.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Laban had two daughters.

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The name of the older was Leah,

00:13:02.218 --> 00:13:05.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the name of the younger, Rachel.

00:13:05.555 --> 00:13:08.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the eyes of Leah had no luster,

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:10.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whereas Rachel had become

00:13:10.894 --> 00:13:14.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a very attractive and beautiful woman.

00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:18.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel,
so he said:

00:13:18.818 --> 00:13:21.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am willing to serve you seven years

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:24.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for your younger daughter Rachel.’

00:13:24.115 --> 00:13:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this Laban said:

00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:31.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is better for me to give her to you
than to give her to another man.

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:33.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep dwelling with me.’

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:41.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in his eyes
they were like just a few days

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:44.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of his love for her.

00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:47.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jacob said to Laban:

00:13:47.138 --> 00:13:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Give over my wife because my days are up,

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:53.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let me have relations with her.’

00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:57.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that Laban gathered
all the men of the place

00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and made a feast.

00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:04.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But during the evening,
he resorted to taking his daughter Leah

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:08.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bringing her to him
that he might have relations with her.

00:14:08.952 --> 00:14:12.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Laban also gave his female servant Zilpah

00:14:12.622 --> 00:14:15.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to his daughter Leah as a servant.

00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:20.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah!

00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:22.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he said to Laban:

00:14:22.882 --> 00:14:24.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What have you done to me?

00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:27.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Was it not for Rachel that I served you?

00:14:27.554 --> 00:14:30.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why have you tricked me?’

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:32.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this Laban said:

00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:37.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is not our custom here to give
the younger woman before the firstborn.

00:14:37.397 --> 00:14:40.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Celebrate the week of this woman.

00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:42.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘After that you will also be given
this other woman

00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:47.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in exchange for serving me
seven more years.’

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:51.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob did so
and celebrated the week of this woman,

00:14:51.619 --> 00:14:55.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after which he gave him
his daughter Rachel as a wife.

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:59.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Besides, Laban gave
his female servant Bilhah

00:14:59.544 --> 00:15:02.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his daughter Rachel as her servant.”

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob has reason to be upset.

00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:09.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had arranged with Laban

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:12.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work seven years for Rachel.

00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the seven years,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
a wedding feast is arranged.

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the heavily-veiled woman
brought in to him

00:15:21.524 --> 00:15:23.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not Rachel;

00:15:23.568 --> 00:15:25.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s Leah!

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how shocked Jacob must have been!

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of admitting to his deceit,

00:15:33.286 --> 00:15:36.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban gives an excuse.

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:39.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
What thoughts come to Jacob’s mind?

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:44.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he consider that Jehovah
might be working out his promise

00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:47.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make Jacob’s offspring plentiful

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the dust particles of the earth”?

00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:52.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turns out,
Leah bears him six sons,

00:15:57.644 --> 00:16:00.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Levi and Judah

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:05.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
—family heads of the two
most honored tribes of Israel.

00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:10.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
Jacob couldn’t have foreknown this.

00:16:10.114 --> 00:16:13.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Jacob the peacemaker

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepts Leah

00:16:15.787 --> 00:16:20.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
and goes along
with Laban’s outrageous request

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:24.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he work an additional seven years
for Rachel.

00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:27.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:16:27.966 --> 00:16:30.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s disappointing when others

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t hold to their agreements.

00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:38.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jacob, can we find it in our hearts

00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:42.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
to forgive and find a way
to preserve peace with them?

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:46.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob serves Laban

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:50.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 14 years for his two wives,

00:16:50.113 --> 00:16:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he works for Laban another 6 years

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:56.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a flock of his own.

00:16:56.202 --> 00:16:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, at Jehovah’s direction,

00:16:59.455 --> 00:17:03.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gathers his family along with his animals

00:17:03.293 --> 00:17:07.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, without informing Laban,
he leaves for home.

00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:12.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Laban learns of this, he is furious!

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:15.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chases and catches up with Jacob.

00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:19.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a dangerous situation,

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:22.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that can easily turn violent.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how it might have been:

00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:29.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob had come to a mountainous region.

00:17:30.194 --> 00:17:34.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Possibly it’s morning, and the air is cool.

00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:37.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are the sounds and smells of animals

00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:42.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
—sheep, donkeys, camels; there are many.

00:17:42.707 --> 00:17:45.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The servants attend to them,

00:17:45.084 --> 00:17:48.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting them ready for the day’s journey.

00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:52.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then come cries of alarm.

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:55.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban has come, and he’s not alone.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
He arrives with strong men.

00:17:58.139 --> 00:18:02.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gallop in on camels; they dismount.

00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:06.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not a friendly visit.

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:11.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban’s men are ready
to obey orders from Laban.

00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:14.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob’s servants quickly gather to the scene.

00:18:14.822 --> 00:18:18.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
All eyes are fixed on Laban and Jacob,

00:18:18.993 --> 00:18:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
who argue.

00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:25.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
The previous night,
Jehovah had warned Laban in a dream

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:29.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be careful about what he’d say to Jacob.

00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Laban is angry and aggressive.

00:18:35.426 --> 00:18:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban makes two charges.

00:18:38.054 --> 00:18:43.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he says:
“Why have you resorted to outwitting me

00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:46.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and carrying my daughters off like captives

00:18:46.604 --> 00:18:48.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“taken by the sword?

00:18:48.606 --> 00:18:50.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why did you run away secretly

00:18:50.942 --> 00:18:53.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and outwit me and not tell me?”

00:18:55.196 --> 00:18:58.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer to that charge is obvious.

00:18:58.032 --> 00:19:00.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob replies:

00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:02.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was because I was afraid,

00:19:02.787 --> 00:19:04.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I said to myself,

00:19:04.914 --> 00:19:08.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You might take your daughters
away from me by force.’”

00:19:09.377 --> 00:19:13.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban also charges that Jacob has stolen

00:19:13.047 --> 00:19:15.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
his household gods.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rachel has indeed stolen the gods,

00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:22.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jacob knows nothing about this.

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:27.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
A search is made,
but the idols are not found.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob then makes his defense.

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:31.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take up our reading

00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:35.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Genesis 31:36.

00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:40.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that Jacob became angry

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:43.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and began to criticize Laban.

00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:46.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob then said to Laban:

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:51.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What is my offense, and for what sin
are you hotly pursuing me?

00:19:51.335 --> 00:19:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now that you have searched
through all my goods,

00:19:54.338 --> 00:19:57.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘what have you found
that belongs to your house?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put it here in front of my brothers
and your brothers,

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:04.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and let them decide between the two of us.

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:07.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘During these 20 years
that I have been with you,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘your sheep and your goats never miscarried,

00:20:10.897 --> 00:20:14.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and I never ate the rams of your flock.

00:20:14.484 --> 00:20:18.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I did not bring you any animal
torn by wild beasts.

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:21.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I would stand the loss of it myself.

00:20:21.532 --> 00:20:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Whether the animal was stolen by day
or was stolen by night,

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you would demand compensation from me.

00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:34.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘By day the heat consumed me,
and the cold by night,

00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:37.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and sleep would flee from my eyes.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:41.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This makes 20 years for me in your house.

00:20:41.552 --> 00:20:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have served you 14 years
for your two daughters

00:20:45.098 --> 00:20:47.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and 6 years for your flock,

00:20:47.517 --> 00:20:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you kept changing my wages ten times.

00:20:51.562 --> 00:20:55.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If the God of my father, the God of Abraham

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:57.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the One whom Isaac fears,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘had not been on my side,

00:21:00.154 --> 00:21:03.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you would now have sent me away
empty-handed.

00:21:03.908 --> 00:21:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God has seen my affliction
and the toil of my hands,

00:21:07.995 --> 00:21:11.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that is why he reproved you last night.’

00:21:11.332 --> 00:21:13.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Laban answered Jacob:

00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:18.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The daughters are my daughters
and the children my children

00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the flock my flock,

00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:22.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and everything you are looking at

00:21:22.927 --> 00:21:26.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is mine and my daughters’.

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:30.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What can I do today against these
or against their children

00:21:30.935 --> 00:21:33.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘whom they have borne?

00:21:33.187 --> 00:21:37.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now come, let us make a covenant,
you and I,

00:21:37.525 --> 00:21:40.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it will serve as a witness between us.’

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Jacob took a stone
and set it up as a pillar.

00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:50.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jacob said to his brothers:
‘Pick up stones!’

00:21:50.037 --> 00:21:53.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they took stones and made a pile.

00:21:53.249 --> 00:21:58.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that they ate there
on the pile of stones.

00:21:58.129 --> 00:22:01.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Laban began calling it Jegarsahadutha,

00:22:01.883 --> 00:22:04.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but Jacob called it Galeed.

00:22:04.802 --> 00:22:06.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Laban then said:

00:22:06.804 --> 00:22:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This pile of stones is a witness

00:22:09.432 --> 00:22:12.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“between me and you today.’

00:22:12.476 --> 00:22:16.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why he named it Galeed,
and the Watchtower,

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for he said:

00:22:18.232 --> 00:22:21.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me

00:22:21.903 --> 00:22:24.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘when we are out of each other’s sight.

00:22:24.697 --> 00:22:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you mistreat my daughters

00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and if you start taking wives
in addition to my daughters,

00:22:31.287 --> 00:22:33.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘though there is no man with us,

00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:38.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remember that God will be a witness
between you and me.’

00:22:38.336 --> 00:22:41.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Laban went on to say to Jacob:

00:22:41.631 --> 00:22:44.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Here is this pile of stones,

00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:48.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and here is the pillar
that I have erected between you and me.

00:22:48.888 --> 00:22:51.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This pile of stones is a witness,

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:54.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the pillar
is something that bears witness,

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:59.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that I will not pass beyond this pile
of stones to bring harm to you

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will not pass
beyond this pile of stones

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and this pillar to bring harm to me.

00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:09.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let the God of Abraham
and the God of Nahor,

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:13.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God of their father, judge between us.’

00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:15.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jacob swore by the One

00:23:15.748 --> 00:23:19.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whom his father Isaac fears.

00:23:19.252 --> 00:23:23.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that Jacob offered
a sacrifice in the mountain

00:23:23.798 --> 00:23:27.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and invited his brothers to eat bread.

00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:31.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they ate
and spent the night in the mountain.

00:23:31.264 --> 00:23:34.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Laban got up early in the morning

00:23:34.475 --> 00:23:39.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and kissed his grandchildren
and his daughters and blessed them.

00:23:39.063 --> 00:23:42.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Laban departed and returned home.”

00:23:45.444 --> 00:23:50.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob had served Laban faithfully
for 20 years,

00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:54.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though Laban had defrauded
and exploited him.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban doesn’t acknowledge that

00:23:56.956 --> 00:23:59.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, dishonestly claims

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:01.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he is the rightful owner

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:04.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all that Jacob has with him.

00:24:04.797 --> 00:24:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban then suggests
that they make a covenant of peace

00:24:09.385 --> 00:24:13.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensuring that neither family
will bring harm to the other.

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:18.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban’s motive is not that he loves peace.

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might have been to ensure
that Jacob will not return

00:24:22.773 --> 00:24:25.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the household gods after Laban’s death

00:24:25.943 --> 00:24:29.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deprive his sons of their inheritance.

00:24:29.822 --> 00:24:33.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any case, Jacob agrees;

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone relaxes;

00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:38.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s to be no violence.

00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:42.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a monument is set up
to memorialize the agreement.

00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the many years of oppression,

00:24:47.423 --> 00:24:51.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob agrees to a covenant of peace.

00:24:51.344 --> 00:24:55.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not harbor resentment
or seek revenge.

00:24:56.932 --> 00:25:00.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
That crisis is over for Jacob.

00:25:00.811 --> 00:25:04.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now another one looms.

00:25:04.148 --> 00:25:07.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob sends messengers to his brother.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say that Jacob is returning

00:25:11.072 --> 00:25:13.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he seeks Esau’s favor.

00:25:14.617 --> 00:25:19.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
The messengers return with the news
that Esau is on his way to meet him

00:25:19.622 --> 00:25:23.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with him are 400 men.

00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:25.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

00:25:25.127 --> 00:25:28.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is Esau still angry?

00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:31.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understandably, Jacob is worried.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not want to fight with his brother.

00:25:34.929 --> 00:25:37.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us see how he handles the situation.

00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:42.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Genesis 32:13.

00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:48.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he spent the night there.

00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:50.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he took some of his possessions

00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:54.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a gift for Esau his brother:

00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:59.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“200 female goats, 20 male goats,

00:25:59.245 --> 00:26:02.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“200 female sheep, 20 rams,

00:26:02.998 --> 00:26:06.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“30 camels nursing their young,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“40 cows, 10 bulls,

00:26:09.547 --> 00:26:11.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“20 female donkeys

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:15.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and 10 full-grown male donkeys.

00:26:15.636 --> 00:26:18.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He handed them over to his servants,

00:26:18.514 --> 00:26:20.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one drove after another,

00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:23.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to his servants:

00:26:23.394 --> 00:26:25.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Cross over ahead of me,

00:26:25.813 --> 00:26:30.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you are to set a space
between one drove and the next.’

00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:33.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He also commanded the first one:

00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:37.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘In case Esau my brother
should meet you and ask,

00:26:37.283 --> 00:26:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“To whom do you belong,
and where are you going,

00:26:40.536 --> 00:26:43.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and to whom do these ahead of you belong?”

00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:47.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘then you should say,
“To your servant Jacob.

00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:51.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“It is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau,

00:26:51.088 --> 00:26:55.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and look! he himself is also behind us.”’

00:26:55.342 --> 00:26:58.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he commanded also the second, the third,

00:26:58.554 --> 00:27:01.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all those following the droves:

00:27:01.765 --> 00:27:03.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘According to this word,

00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:07.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you are to speak to Esau when you meet him.

00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And you should also say,

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:13.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
““Here is your servant Jacob behind us.”’

00:27:13.402 --> 00:27:15.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he said to himself:

00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:20.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If I appease him
by sending a gift ahead of me,

00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:23.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘then afterward when I see him,

00:27:23.204 --> 00:27:26.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
he may give me a kindly reception.’”

00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:32.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob wants peaceful relations
with his brother.

00:27:32.171 --> 00:27:36.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sends a generous gift
—hundreds of animals—

00:27:36.759 --> 00:27:39.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help make that possible.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Jacob weak-minded,

00:27:41.388 --> 00:27:44.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
too cowardly to stand up to his brother?

00:27:44.725 --> 00:27:46.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, as the time neared
for the meeting with Esau,

00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:52.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob wrestles with an angel until dawn

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:57.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive further assurance
of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:27:57.071 --> 00:28:01.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now see what happens
when the two brothers meet.

00:28:02.576 --> 00:28:06.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Genesis 33:1.

00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:11.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Jacob raised his eyes

00:28:11.418 --> 00:28:14.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and saw Esau coming,

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:17.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and 400 men were with him.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he divided the children
among Leah, Rachel,

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the two female servants.

00:28:24.306 --> 00:28:29.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He put the female servants
and their children in front,

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:32.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Leah and her children after them,

00:28:32.022 --> 00:28:35.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Rachel and Joseph behind them.

00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:38.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he himself went ahead of them

00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:41.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bowed down to the earth seven times

00:28:41.782 --> 00:28:44.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he came near to his brother.

00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Esau ran to meet him,

00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:51.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he embraced him and kissed him,

00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:54.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they burst into tears.

00:28:54.461 --> 00:28:58.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he raised his eyes
and saw the women and the children,

00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:01.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he said: ‘Who are these with you?’

00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:03.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To which he said:

00:29:03.971 --> 00:29:08.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The children with whom God
has favored your servant.’

00:29:08.017 --> 00:29:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that the female servants
came forward with their children

00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:14.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bowed down,

00:29:14.857 --> 00:29:18.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Leah too came forward with her children,

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they bowed down.

00:29:20.321 --> 00:29:23.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Joseph came forward with Rachel,

00:29:23.574 --> 00:29:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they bowed down.

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:27.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Esau said:

00:29:27.703 --> 00:29:31.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What is the purpose of all this camp
of travelers that I have met?’

00:29:31.707 --> 00:29:35.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He replied: ‘In order to find favor

00:29:35.002 --> 00:29:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the eyes of my lord.’

00:29:37.087 --> 00:29:39.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Esau said:

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:43.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have a great many possessions,
my brother.

00:29:43.093 --> 00:29:45.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep what is yours.’

00:29:45.512 --> 00:29:47.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Jacob said:

00:29:47.848 --> 00:29:50.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No, please.

00:29:50.392 --> 00:29:53.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If I have found favor in your eyes,

00:29:53.854 --> 00:29:56.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you must take my gift from my hand,

00:29:56.815 --> 00:30:01.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because I brought it
so that I could see your face.

00:30:01.654 --> 00:30:04.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And I have seen your face

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘as though seeing God’s face,

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:10.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in that you received me with pleasure.

00:30:10.412 --> 00:30:12.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Take, please,

00:30:12.623 --> 00:30:16.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the gift conveying my blessing
that was brought to you,

00:30:16.877 --> 00:30:19.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for God has favored me

00:30:19.755 --> 00:30:23.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I have everything I need.’

00:30:23.384 --> 00:30:28.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he continued to urge him,
so that he took it.”

00:30:30.474 --> 00:30:32.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a happy outcome!

00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:36.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of an angry confrontation,

00:30:36.146 --> 00:30:38.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a joyful reunion.

00:30:38.857 --> 00:30:42.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two men shed tears; they embrace.

00:30:42.653 --> 00:30:47.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, Jacob is the peacemaker.

00:30:47.241 --> 00:30:49.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he prove that?

00:30:49.576 --> 00:30:53.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
He prayed, and he acted in harmony
with his prayers.

00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:55.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sent gifts.

00:30:55.541 --> 00:31:00.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed honor and respect to his brother,
calling him lord

00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:03.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bowing seven times.

00:31:03.173 --> 00:31:05.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:08.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t this account well illustrate

00:31:08.178 --> 00:31:11.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
the extent to which we
should be willing to go

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:15.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preserve peace
with our Christian brothers and sisters?

00:31:16.937 --> 00:31:19.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learn so much

00:31:19.189 --> 00:31:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
about seeking peace from Jacob.

00:31:22.192 --> 00:31:25.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
When threatened by his brother
while living at home,

00:31:25.446 --> 00:31:27.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
he moved away.

00:31:27.448 --> 00:31:31.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
When deceived by Laban
regarding Rachel and Leah,

00:31:31.535 --> 00:31:33.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
he yielded.

00:31:33.662 --> 00:31:37.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
When chased down and accused by Laban,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob agreed to a covenant of peace.

00:31:40.753 --> 00:31:45.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when confronting Esau, he offered a gift.

00:31:45.215 --> 00:31:46.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind,

00:31:46.842 --> 00:31:48.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
in none of these situations

00:31:48.969 --> 00:31:52.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
was Jacob the one who needed to apologize.

00:31:52.264 --> 00:31:54.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, throughout his life,

00:31:54.808 --> 00:31:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob loved peace.

00:31:58.187 --> 00:32:01.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
He relied on Jehovah,

00:32:01.106 --> 00:32:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed him.

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:06.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never forgot Jacob

00:32:06.528 --> 00:32:09.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he pursued peace

00:32:09.198 --> 00:32:11.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his dealings with others.

00:32:11.825 --> 00:32:14.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do the same

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:18.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when we pursue peace
in the face of injustice,

00:32:18.832 --> 00:32:21.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of persecution,

00:32:21.293 --> 00:32:25.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
in small issues as well as in big issues—

00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:28.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will not forget us either.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will richly bless us

00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:33.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we love peace

00:32:33.138 --> 00:32:37.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Jacob loved peace.

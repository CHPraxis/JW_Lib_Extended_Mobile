00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:03.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our previous talk reminded us

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:06.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s possible
for a family to enjoy peace,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it takes work.

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at one more step
that can help us stay on the road to peace,

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is good communication.

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
A family promotes peace
when all the family members communicate

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an open, calm, and honest manner.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does communication help with peace?

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a pattern of good communication
keeps a family close.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to identify and address problems

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
before these reach a point
that they take peace away.

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that may seem obvious.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t it true that we may find
that between work and school,

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
the meetings and ministry,
and recreation and just life in general

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s hard to find time
to communicate as a family?

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that a challenge in your family?

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what habits
hinder family communication.

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:13.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Steve.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I’m sorry I was late to the meeting.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should have been there
to help out with my assignment.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we got delayed.

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:31.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re late!

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go, kids!

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re coming! Sorry!

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, the family is fine.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody is adjusting really well.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone seen my glasses?

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone?

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we might be a little out of sync,

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:04.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t know

00:02:04.603 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every family has their issues, right?

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
You going outside in those?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, well, thanks for understanding.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:22.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Take care.

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:25.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, bye-bye.

00:02:56.196 --> 00:03:00.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice some habits
that hinder family communication?

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the case of this family, it seems like

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
technology is stifling their communication.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:09.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they obviously have some things
they need to communicate about

00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
—punctuality, dress and grooming—
but it’s not happening.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while the scenes of them

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:18.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
all looking at their devices
and ignoring one another

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:21.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have been a bit humorous,

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
did it remind you of your family at times?

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:29.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a good reminder
for us not to let the use of technology

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:33.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
rob our family of our time and attention!

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we develop habits

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
that promote good communication?

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the second Bible principle
of this symposium.

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn together, please,
to Ephesians chapter 5.

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s read verses 15 and 16

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ephesians 5:15, 16:

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So keep strict watch that how you

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:59.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“walk is not as unwise but as wise persons,

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:02.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making the best use of your time,

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the days are wicked.”

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:08.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at two ways
that this Bible principle can help us.

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:12.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is by making time

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have meaningful communication.

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice there in verse 16

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:20.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says “making the best use of your time”?

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:23.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the study note for this phrase indicates

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
the need to ‘buy out the time’
for important things

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other pursuits.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:32.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can this apply
to family communication?

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:36.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this could include
having a plan, or a routine,

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
for when we spend time together
as a family each day.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during those times,
we may choose to limit

00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
our use of technology so that it
does not interfere with communication;

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps it’s in the evening
or at a specific mealtime.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother named Aaron stated,

00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:58.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have our evening meal together,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which allows us time to talk
and hear what’s important

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:03.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
to each member of the family.”

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “My wife and I
have arranged our schedules

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:09.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so we take the boys
to school and pick them up.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
This allows us to spend more time with them.”

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:15.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he says,
“My wife and I regularly take walks

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:18.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and freely talk about our concerns.”

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:20.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:23.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they’re making good use of their time.

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:27.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, to do this, they’ve had to buy
that time out from other pursuits.

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:30.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they have a plan; they have a routine.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:34.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what plan, or routine,

00:05:34.146 --> 00:05:38.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
does your family have
for meaningful communication each day?

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:43.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t have one, can you start now?

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:47.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at the second way
that this Bible principle can help us.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:50.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is by determining when and how

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:54.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal with problems when they do arise.

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice verse 15 in Ephesians chapter 5

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:01.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that we should ‘walk as wise persons.’

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:04.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means we need
to choose our paths carefully,

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing when to go, when to stop,
when to take another route.

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:13.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can that help us
when problems arise?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a wise person

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
generally knows when is and when is not

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
a good time to address a problem.

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, we all can attest
that when emotions are high,

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:30.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s probably not the best time
to bring up an issue.

00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:32.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father states:

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:35.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sometimes we need to wait
and let things cool.

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Often a night’s rest
with prayer makes a big difference

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we address the issue the next morning.”

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:44.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a wise person.

00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:48.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
A wise person also listens.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:19 reminds us to “be quick to listen,

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:55.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
slow to speak, [and] slow to anger.”

00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:57.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we can go to Jehovah in prayer

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:00.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask him to help us to really listen,

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay calm, to stay humble.

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:07.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister named Dawn states,

00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:10.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When there are problems,
the first thing I do

00:07:10.117 --> 00:07:14.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
is ask Jehovah in prayer to help us
resolve the problem calmly.”

00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:18.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she says, “Then we talk
with the family member privately

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:23.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really try to listen
to their side of the issue.”

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a wise person.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
A wise person will also consider the approach

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the words that he or she uses.

00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:35.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, rather than telling
our family member that they have a problem,

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:39.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
can we turn it around so that it’s something
that we all need to work on together?

00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:42.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you reassure your family members

00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you really love them
and you want to understand

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:49.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
their side of the issue or the problem?

00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:52.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, now, doing this,
we’re not attacking the family member

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather,
showing that we’re all in this together.

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see benefits of this Bible principle

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:02.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
in communication in our family, don’t we?

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice the two points:
(1) making the best use of our time

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (2) walking as wise persons.

00:08:11.928 --> 00:08:16.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, communication will always be
a work in progress,

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:19.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s worth the effort,
as it will go a long way

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:22.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bringing peace to your family.

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:25.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch more of our dramatization

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice the benefits of developing habits

00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:30.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
that promote good communication.

00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:36.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:38.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:08:38.455 --> 00:08:41.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all have to work on it.
I know I need to.

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we approach it that way
with the kids

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just be open with them?

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:48.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds like a good idea.

00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:54.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. So Irene and I have been talking about

00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
communication

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:58.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our family.

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:01.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to talk
about our phones and other devices.

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:04.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not talking about me, are you?

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t do that.

00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:05.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that we can all be
more balanced, but . . .

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:07.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need it.

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:09.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re joking, right? You mean them.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:10.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t take them away.

00:09:10.153 --> 00:09:11.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t done anything bad.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have responsibilities.

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:12.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re always on your phone too.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

00:09:16.076 --> 00:09:18.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just talk about it, all right?

00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:21.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sue,

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:27.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you read Ephesians 5:15, 16
for us, please?

00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:32.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So keep strict watch that how you walk

00:09:32.717 --> 00:09:36.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is not as unwise but as wise persons,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the best use of your time,
because the days are wicked.”

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:44.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
So

00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:48.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think we’re doing
with our phones and other devices?

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:59.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t that what you’re doing
on your devices is wrong.

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:04.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could it be taking time away
from more important things

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:07.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like talking to each other,

00:10:09.337 --> 00:10:13.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in that way affecting even
how we’re talking to each other?

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:23.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think it’d be smart

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have some boundaries then.

00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:31.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, OK.

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:35.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:38.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about how we can do that.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Olivia.

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:53.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, I haven’t figured out
how to talk to her about her clothes yet.

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:53.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:10:53.673 --> 00:10:55.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need your help.

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:57.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got this one.

00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know,

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:06.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s all about good spiritual judgment.

00:11:06.394 --> 00:11:11.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that these trends reflect
Jehovah’s view of “respectable dress”?

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:15.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that you’ll do the right thing.

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:19.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:21.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Gabe, can you take us?

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:23.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:23.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:26.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we’re all here,

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:30.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know we all have
different views on punctuality,

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:32.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really need your help

00:11:33.922 --> 00:11:37.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can take care
of some of my responsibilities.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:11:41.596 --> 00:11:42.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:11:42.097 --> 00:11:42.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:42.597 --> 00:11:44.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. Great.

00:12:05.078 --> 00:12:07.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this symposium has been discussing

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:11.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
four Bible principles
that can guide families to peace.

00:12:11.626 --> 00:12:14.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Dellinger considered the first one

00:12:14.337 --> 00:12:16.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 12:10.

00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:20.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this part, we considered
Ephesians chapter 5,

00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:22.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 15, 16.

00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:27.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did we see how this scripture
helped our family in the video?

00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:30.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we saw that they knew down deep
that they were not making

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:34.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best use of their time,
so they made changes.

00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:37.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
They saw that they needed to set boundaries

00:12:37.444 --> 00:12:40.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could improve
their communication.

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:44.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also saw how the family
—the parents—acted as wise persons.

00:12:44.242 --> 00:12:45.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:47.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by determining when and how

00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:50.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
to address the problems
that needed to be addressed,

00:12:50.749 --> 00:12:54.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the use of technology,
dress and grooming,

00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:57.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and punctuality.

00:12:57.172 --> 00:13:00.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, can this Bible principle
help your family

00:13:00.342 --> 00:13:03.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
—help my family—to improve communication?

00:13:03.637 --> 00:13:06.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would this be a good scripture to include

00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your next family worship?

00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:13.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it takes time to learn how
to communicate well as a family.

00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:16.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is worth the effort.

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:17.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:21.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we strive to communicate
well each day,

00:13:21.446 --> 00:13:24.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
then communication will come more readily

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:26.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there are problems.

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be determined to look for ways

00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
to improve communication in your family.

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:36.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by taking this initiative
and sticking with it,

00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:38.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will be following the road map

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
to family peace.

00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:45.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please listen now to Brother David Splane,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:49.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he considers the next talk
of this symposium,

00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:53.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace
—Work as a Team.”

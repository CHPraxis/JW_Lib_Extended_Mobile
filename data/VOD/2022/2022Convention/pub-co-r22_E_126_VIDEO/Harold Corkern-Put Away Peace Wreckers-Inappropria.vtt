00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
What comes to your mind
when you hear the expression “put away”?

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:08.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may think of related expressions

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as “cast aside,” “dispose of,”

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:15.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“discard,” “get rid of.”

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:20.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did we have to put away
to become a Christian?

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:22.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible in the book

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:27.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Ephesians 4:22
provides the answer.

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Ephesians 4:22:

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You were taught
to put away the old personality

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:39.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that conforms
to your former course of conduct

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:43.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is being corrupted
according to its deceptive desires.”

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:48.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we had “to put away the old personality.”

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s one thing to put it away;

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s something else to keep it away.

00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why
in the very next verse, verse 23,

00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul encourages us to do this:

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:02.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:05.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:08.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so important to keep it away,

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:11.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the old personality has traits

00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:14.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can become peace wreckers.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium
will consider five peace wreckers

00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:23.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should put away and keep away.

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each talk will include
the following main points:

00:01:26.154 --> 00:01:30.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) It will define the peace wrecker,

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) it will explain how it wrecks peace,

00:01:34.663 --> 00:01:38.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) we will consider how to put it away.

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:44.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the very first one
that we’re going to talk about?

00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:48.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is inappropriate boasting.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:51.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is inappropriate boasting?

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:53.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, it’s self-praise,

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible condemns self-praise

00:01:56.562 --> 00:02:00.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice Proverbs 27:2:

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:02.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let someone else praise you,

00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:04.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and not your own mouth;

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:07.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
others, and not your own lips.”

00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:12.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Self-praise is an evidence of pride

00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:17.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
that causes one
to elevate himself above others.

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some might develop an unhealthy pride

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:24.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
about their accomplishments,
even in the ministry.

00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:26.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happened in the first century.

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul had to write
to the Corinthian congregation

00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:31.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the dissensions that they were having,

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:34.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lack of peace they were experiencing.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:39.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, some in the congregation
were “puffed up with pride” about themselves

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:41.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other men,

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:45.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Paul, Apollos, Cephas.

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were giving
too much attention to themselves

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:50.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to other men.

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:54.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how could that happen today?

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s imagine
a group of brothers talking,

00:02:56.918 --> 00:02:59.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one in the group says,

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:02.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With Jehovah’s help
and with diligent prayer and effort,

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:05.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
I finally got a Bible study.”

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
But right away,
another one in the group proudly declares,

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have four Bible studies;

00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
two are attending meetings,
and one will soon be baptized.”

00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:20.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could such a statement be a peace wrecker?

00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does inappropriate boasting
wreck peace?

00:03:26.617 --> 00:03:29.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s not wrong
to take pleasure in our work

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:33.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to thank Jehovah
for the success that we may have.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
But inappropriate boasting
about our accomplishments

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:40.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
can stir up competition, envy, and rivalry.

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must remember that self-promotion

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not originate
with our heavenly Father, “the God of peace.”

00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:50.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where does it originate?

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 2:16 says:

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The showy display of one’s means of life

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not originate with the Father,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
but originates with the world.”

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:05.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
And would you not agree
that the world is filled with self-praise?

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even on their social media, we see this.

00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:11.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the material
that people post on social media

00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:15.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to make one
appear very important.

00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is a showy display

00:04:17.963 --> 00:04:20.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
of their accomplishments,
their material possessions,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
or their expensive vacations that they enjoy.

00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:29.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, it’s all about “look at me.”

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to avoid getting caught up

00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:35.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the world’s spirit of self-promotion

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wrecks peace.

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:41.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate just how devastating

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace wrecker’s
inappropriate boasting can be,

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:48.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s briefly consider
the Bible character Haman.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a proud and haughty man,

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he boasted a lot.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esther chapter 5 tells us

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was boasting
with his family and friends

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his wealth, his many sons,

00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:03.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the king had promoted him
to a high station,

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:05.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was above all the other servants,

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he’d had a special meal, or banquet,

00:05:08.643 --> 00:05:10.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the king and queen.

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:14.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Haman was hateful and arrogant.

00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:18.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was plotting to kill
Jehovah’s faithful servant Mordecai.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
But his scheme
and his attitudes were exposed.

00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:25.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happened?

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
The very stake that Haman had built

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:31.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hang Mordecai on he was hung on.

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it reminds us
—doesn’t it?—

00:05:33.544 --> 00:05:37.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at Isaiah 29:20, the Bible says:

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:41.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The boaster will come to his finish.”

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:43.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
So because of the devastating effects

00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:47.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
that improper boasting
can have on ourselves and others,

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:51.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not even want
to give the impression of boasting.

00:05:52.773 --> 00:05:55.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:57.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a sister’s actions

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
are misunderstood as boasting.

00:06:04.077 --> 00:06:06.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put away from yourselves every kind

00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:10.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath,

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“screaming, and abusive speech,

00:06:13.754 --> 00:06:16.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as everything injurious.”

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did anyone start the day thinking,

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:24.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I believe I’ll show malicious bitterness
to my brother today’?

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not! 

00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:28.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet the potential is there, isn’t it?

00:06:29.938 --> 00:06:34.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
But genuine affection fights peace wreckers.

00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:39.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
And affection grows when we really know
our brothers and sisters well.

00:06:39.073 --> 00:06:43.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember their joys

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pains,

00:06:46.748 --> 00:06:49.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
their selfless zeal,

00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:52.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they came to love Jehovah,

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they endure.

00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:03.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll get back as soon as I can.

00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:04.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love you. Bye.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:07:09.355 --> 00:07:10.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, love?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
So sorry, I’ve got to run.

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:14.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. I’ll ring you about this week.

00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:14.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks. Love you both.

00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:15.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you!

00:07:16.113 --> 00:07:17.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
The afternoon would look better.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nana!

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:22.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, Haley, darling.

00:07:22.328 --> 00:07:24.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so, so sorry.

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it’s not too bad.

00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:30.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got this.

00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:31.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are you though?

00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:34.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you. I’m so sorry.

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:35.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, poor thing.

00:07:35.592 --> 00:07:37.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me clear this up.

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:47.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:51.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, Nana, it’s Sunday today, isn’t it?

00:07:51.984 --> 00:07:53.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s felt like such a long day, hasn’t it?

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has felt like a long day.

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:03.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:08:04.122 --> 00:08:05.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sleep well.

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:43.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here,

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:49.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping you to be effortlessly elegant.

00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:52.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to welcome my new followers

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first up, I’ve got
this gorgeous earring and necklace set.

00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:03.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you can see, the first disc I’ve done
is in this warm nude tone,

00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:04.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s great because it goes . . .

00:09:04.729 --> 00:09:06.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe her?

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:09.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley’s business feed?

00:09:10.152 --> 00:09:12.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what makes this set is really special.

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:15.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s giving you
that understated elegant look.

Because as you know,

00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:25.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you look this good, you feel great.

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:35.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was the sister in this video
boasting inappropriately?

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:39.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she was a humble servant of Jehovah,

00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:43.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
kindly and patiently
helping her elderly relative.

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:46.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you recall her business website

00:09:46.983 --> 00:09:50.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the presentation she made
about her jewelry products?

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:52.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said,

00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:56.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When you look this good,
you feel great.”

00:09:57.494 --> 00:10:00.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her Christian sister was upset

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took those comments and her actions

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be boastful.

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:07.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this video reminds us

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about how our words and our actions

00:10:11.008 --> 00:10:13.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
may appear to others.

00:10:13.594 --> 00:10:16.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we’re going to get to the question:

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:20.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we put away inappropriate boasting?

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:23.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
A key point that we must always remember

00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:26.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to do just that
is recorded in the book

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:31.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 1 Corinthians 4:7,

00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:34.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Corinthians 4:7:

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For who makes you different from another?

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:41.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, what do you have
that you did not receive?

00:10:41.416 --> 00:10:43.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, in fact, you did receive it,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do you boast
as though you did not receive it?”

00:10:48.173 --> 00:10:50.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point of this scripture?

00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not want to boast about ourselves

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
but give all credit to Jehovah
for the good that we can do.

00:10:58.226 --> 00:11:02.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some people are proud
about their good looks,

00:11:02.313 --> 00:11:05.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
their popularity,
their wealth, their position,

00:11:05.609 --> 00:11:10.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
their physical strength,
their musical ability.

00:11:10.197 --> 00:11:13.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, King David of ancient Israel

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
had all of those assets.

00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:17.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
But throughout his entire life,

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
he never became a boastful person.

00:11:19.957 --> 00:11:21.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
He remained humble.

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:23.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:11:23.753 --> 00:11:26.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 113:5-8,

00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:30.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
David gave all credit to Jehovah.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that in his case
Jehovah stooped down

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:37.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took this “lowly” one
and raised him up

00:11:37.142 --> 00:11:39.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “sit with nobles.”

00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:42.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on every occasion that he had,

00:11:42.315 --> 00:11:45.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
David would always say, ‘Praise Jehovah,

00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:48.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
boast about his holy name.’

00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:53.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we, like David,
should “boast in Jehovah.”

00:11:53.243 --> 00:11:57.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul encouraged us to do that
at 1 Corinthians 1:31:

00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:01.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who boasts,
let him boast in Jehovah.”

00:12:01.752 --> 00:12:04.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:12:04.004 --> 00:12:08.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that we boast in the privilege
of knowing the true God

00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:12.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of being able
to be used by him to accomplish his will.

00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:19.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another way
that we can put away improper boasting

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:21.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to not talk about ourselves,

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:25.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to acknowledge the good
and the fine qualities

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:27.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our fellow workers have.

00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:32.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble and modest people
don’t brag about what they do,

00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they turn their attention
to their fellow workers

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Jehovah is using them

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blessing them in his service.

00:12:39.501 --> 00:12:41.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do that,

00:12:41.503 --> 00:12:44.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that creates a very peaceful,
happy environment.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:50.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, may we continue
to put away and keep away

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:53.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
inappropriate boasting—self-praise.

00:12:53.057 --> 00:12:54.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:59.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
By giving praise and thanks and honor
to Jehovah for our accomplishments

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by commending our fellow workers
for all the good qualities they have

00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for how Jehovah
is using them in his service.

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:11.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, we will preserve
our precious possession of peace

00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:14.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah and with our brothers.

00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:20.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Seth Hyatt,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:13:23.423 --> 00:13:26.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers—Envy.”

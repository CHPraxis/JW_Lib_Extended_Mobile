00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to the fifth session
of our “Pursue Peace”! Convention,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
which corresponds to the Sunday
morning session on your program.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:34.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our music-video presentation
is about to begin.

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch,
please notice how pursuing peace

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
with God brings great happiness.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the presentation!

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:36.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture theme
for this session and the next

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:40.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
is taken from the inspired words
found at Romans 15:13,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says in part:

00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:45.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:48.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill you with all joy and peace.”

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:52.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite all to sing song number 101,

00:10:52.797 --> 00:10:54.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Working Together in Unity.”

00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:58.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, that’s song number 101.

00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:57.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, specific challenges
can make it difficult

00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:01.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
for servants of Jehovah to pursue peace.

00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are these challenges,
and how can we overcome them?

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:09.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
These questions will be answered
in a seven-part symposium.

00:13:09.643 --> 00:13:12.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will consider
how we can imitate the examples

00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:17.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who reaped peace
after first sowing it.

00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:21.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin, let’s give our attention
to Brother William Turner,

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:26.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Service Committee, 
as he presents the talk

00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:30.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Joseph and His Brothers.”

00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:43.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains
many fundamental principles

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:47.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Christian
can use every day to guide his life.

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:49.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:13:49.307 --> 00:13:51.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 13:20, we’re told

00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:56.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we ‘walk with wise persons,
we will become wise.’

00:13:56.398 --> 00:13:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 28:20 states
that if ‘we’re faithful,

00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:02.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will receive many blessings.’

00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:06.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely you have Bible principles
that you live by as well.

00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:11.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as it pertains to pursuing peace,

00:14:11.955 --> 00:14:14.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is one essential principle

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
that must be followed.

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:19.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out what it is.

00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:22.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Galatians chapter 6,

00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:28.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read the words
of Galatians chapter 6,

00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:30.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 7, 8.

00:14:33.143 --> 00:14:35.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read:

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:37.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be misled:

00:14:37.772 --> 00:14:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is not one to be mocked.

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:42.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For whatever a person is sowing,

00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:45.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this he will also reap;

00:14:45.447 --> 00:14:48.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the one sowing
with a view to his flesh

00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:51.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will reap corruption from his flesh,

00:14:51.327 --> 00:14:54.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the one sowing with a view to the spirit

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reap everlasting life from the spirit.”

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:00.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the principle:

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:04.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
We reap what we sow.

00:15:04.257 --> 00:15:06.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think of a farmer;

00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:10.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knows that he must plant
what he hopes to reap.

00:15:10.722 --> 00:15:14.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also knows that he will not
reap fruitage right away,

00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:19.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he trusts the results
will come in due time.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is similar with the quality of peace.

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:26.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only way for us to reap peace

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:28.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to sow it.

00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:30.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we put in the work to achieve it,

00:15:30.283 --> 00:15:32.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust that in due time

00:15:32.827 --> 00:15:34.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will reap the benefits.

00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:40.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium, we will consider Bible
and modern-day accounts

00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:44.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how Jehovah’s people,
despite particular challenges,

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:48.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
have reaped peace after first sowing it.

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:52.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one particular challenge
to gaining peace

00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:55.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
is problems within the family.

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:57.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of imperfection,

00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:00.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not uncommon to have disagreements,

00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:03.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
even tension, from time to time.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:07.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
And family members may hurt one another
in various ways.

00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:10.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
And usually such offenses are minor,

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:13.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace can quickly be sown and reaped.

00:16:15.203 --> 00:16:19.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if the offense is more serious?

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:23.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
A family member says or does something
that hurts us deeply.

00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, even then,

00:16:27.257 --> 00:16:32.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
it still may be possible
to sow and reap peace.

00:16:33.054 --> 00:16:35.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can prove this
by considering the Bible account

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:39.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Joseph and his brothers.

00:16:39.018 --> 00:16:41.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re familiar with the story.

00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:45.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of envy,
Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery.

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:48.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was by no means a minor offense.

00:16:48.278 --> 00:16:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
It began with Joseph being led to Egypt.

00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:54.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, he was falsely accused
and thrown into prison.

00:16:54.993 --> 00:16:57.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for 13 years,

00:16:57.704 --> 00:17:02.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph suffered mistreatment
when he had done nothing to deserve it.

00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:06.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it could have been very easy
for Joseph to feel

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if he ever saw his brothers again,

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best option for peace

00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be not to have any dealings
with them at all.

00:17:15.847 --> 00:17:18.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we might feel the same way as well.

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:21.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Joseph didn’t do that.

00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:24.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, after some years passed,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
both Joseph and his brothers sowed peace.

00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:29.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, note how this was done.

00:17:29.903 --> 00:17:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to the 105th Psalm,

00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:40.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note the 19th verse of Psalm 105.

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:48.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Until the time
that his word proved true,

00:17:48.379 --> 00:17:51.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the saying of Jehovah

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:53.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what refined him.”

00:17:55.053 --> 00:17:59.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph trusted in Jehovah to refine him,

00:17:59.223 --> 00:18:02.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
to shape his thinking and godly qualities.

00:18:02.518 --> 00:18:05.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
He refused to become bitter.

00:18:05.313 --> 00:18:08.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, how interesting it is to note

00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:11.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is nothing
in the Scriptures to indicate

00:18:11.027 --> 00:18:15.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Joseph ever told anyone,
not even Pharaoh,

00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:17.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his brothers were the ones

00:18:17.825 --> 00:18:22.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
who kidnapped him and sold him as a slave.

00:18:22.163 --> 00:18:24.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how about Joseph’s brothers?

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:28.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years after they had mistreated him,
they met Joseph in Egypt.

00:18:28.836 --> 00:18:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Joseph tested them
by giving the youngest brother, Benjamin,

00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:35.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
significantly more attention
than he gave the others,

00:18:35.802 --> 00:18:39.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saw that his brothers had changed.

00:18:39.138 --> 00:18:42.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had let go of envy.

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:44.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed genuine concern for their brother

00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:47.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for their father, Jacob.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph realized
that his brothers were repentant,

00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:53.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he forgave them.

00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:58.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because Joseph and his brothers
were willing to take steps to sow peace,

00:18:58.032 --> 00:19:00.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
they reaped the benefits

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:04.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually were able to enjoy

00:19:04.247 --> 00:19:06.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
a harmonious relationship.

00:19:08.376 --> 00:19:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can the example
of Joseph and his brothers

00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:13.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us today?

00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:19.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a family member sows peace.

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:33.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every morning

00:19:33.943 --> 00:19:36.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and I mean every morning—

00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:39.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s Jeremy singing
at the top of his lungs.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:40.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, I wasn’t the only one.

00:19:40.658 --> 00:19:43.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but you were the loudest.

00:19:43.286 --> 00:19:46.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:49.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always impressed
with how close you two were.

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:51.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:19:51.878 --> 00:19:55.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t always that way.

00:19:55.923 --> 00:19:58.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:19:58.217 --> 00:20:01.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, it started out that way.

00:20:01.137 --> 00:20:04.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nick and I—we weren’t just brothers;

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were friends.

00:20:06.642 --> 00:20:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the family business
ran into trouble,

00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:15.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what started
as a small disagreement just exploded.

00:20:15.276 --> 00:20:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t even understand at all
how our business works!

00:20:18.905 --> 00:20:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of criticizing,
could you just once . . .

00:20:23.534 --> 00:20:25.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremy!

00:20:26.329 --> 00:20:29.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost us?

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:31.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a choice.
You went behind my back!

00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:33.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your problem?

00:20:34.378 --> 00:20:36.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
You!
You’re the problem.

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:47.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to work it out.

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
But things just got worse.

00:20:55.274 --> 00:20:57.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a door
had slammed shut between us.

00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the outside,
I acted like everything was fine.

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:05.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
But inside, I couldn’t let it go.

00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:16.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like a total hypocrite,

00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:26.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that had to change.

00:21:39.944 --> 00:21:42.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:21:42.488 --> 00:21:44.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let go

00:21:46.033 --> 00:21:47.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to move on—

00:21:49.662 --> 00:21:51.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make things right with Nick.

00:21:55.668 --> 00:21:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took a long time
for the wounds to heal . . .

00:22:00.798 --> 00:22:04.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and for us to trust each other
the way we used to.

00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:12.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we did.

00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:22.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful that we made peace

00:22:26.073 --> 00:22:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the world turned upside down.

00:22:33.831 --> 00:22:38.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can you and I
imitate Joseph and his brothers?

00:22:38.294 --> 00:22:40.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss three steps.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first step is found at Ephesians 4:32.

00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:49.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that

00:22:49.388 --> 00:22:53.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ephesian 4:32:

00:22:55.686 --> 00:22:58.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But become kind to one another,

00:22:58.314 --> 00:23:02.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tenderly compassionate,
freely forgiving one another

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:04.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as God also by Christ

00:23:04.612 --> 00:23:07.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
freely forgave you.”

00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first, we must be ready to forgive.

00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:18.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we let grievances and resentment build up
and develop in our hearts,

00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:22.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes even more difficult
to be forgiving.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note in the video that what started
as a small disagreement

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:30.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Nick and Jeremy exploded
into something much bigger?

00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:32.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:37.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremy could not let go
of his resentment toward his brother.

00:23:39.105 --> 00:23:42.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must work to treat others
in a forgiving way,

00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:44.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Jehovah treats us.

00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second step:

00:23:48.698 --> 00:23:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t dwell on the offense.

00:23:52.576 --> 00:23:56.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 17:9 says:
“The one who keeps harping on a matter

00:23:56.747 --> 00:24:00.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
separates close friends.”

00:24:00.084 --> 00:24:03.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that how Jeremy described
the relationship with his brother?

00:24:03.754 --> 00:24:07.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a door slammed shut between them.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t until steps were taken to sow peace

00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:14.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
—having that open, honest communication
with each other;

00:24:14.098 --> 00:24:17.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
spending time together;
working with each other in the ministry—

00:24:17.768 --> 00:24:22.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
only then did things start to improve.

00:24:22.732 --> 00:24:24.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice?

00:24:24.984 --> 00:24:28.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything did not go back
to normal right away.

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:32.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took time to reap peace,

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
time for those wounds to heal,

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:38.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
time to regain lost trust.

00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:43.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can’t look for miracles,

00:24:43.127 --> 00:24:46.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we should look for progress.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:50.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the farmer, trust that in due time

00:24:50.968 --> 00:24:54.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will see results from our efforts.

00:24:56.849 --> 00:25:00.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s where
the all-important third step comes in:

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask Jehovah in prayer

00:25:03.105 --> 00:25:07.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to let go of resentment.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Psalm 105:19.

00:25:10.112 --> 00:25:13.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was “the saying of Jehovah”
that helped refine Joseph

00:25:13.824 --> 00:25:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
to develop the qualities needed
not to become bitter

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:20.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to let go of any resentment.

00:25:20.247 --> 00:25:24.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, Jeremy acknowledged
that he needed Jehovah’s help

00:25:24.585 --> 00:25:28.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let go and to move on.

00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:31.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah can do the same for us.

00:25:33.094 --> 00:25:37.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not easy when we go through situations
that threaten the peace of our family.

00:25:37.848 --> 00:25:41.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we live by this fundamental principle

00:25:41.227 --> 00:25:43.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we reap what we sow—

00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:47.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we can be assured
that with a forgiving spirit,

00:25:47.566 --> 00:25:50.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for opportunities to sow peace,

00:25:50.236 --> 00:25:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beseeching Jehovah for his help

00:25:52.822 --> 00:25:55.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
our efforts will be blessed

00:25:55.408 --> 00:26:00.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in due time, we and our family
can reap the benefits

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:02.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy true peace.

00:26:04.417 --> 00:26:07.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:26:07.878 --> 00:26:10.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—The Gibeonites.”

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:26.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a battle
that has lasted for centuries

00:26:26.188 --> 00:26:28.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continues down to our day.

00:26:28.732 --> 00:26:30.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a battle of wills

00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:33.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the will of disobedient humans

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:36.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
who fight against Jehovah’s will.

00:26:36.323 --> 00:26:39.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than submitting
or surrendering their will

00:26:39.285 --> 00:26:42.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do Jehovah’s will, most humans refuse

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make peace with him,
becoming peacebreakers.

00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:48.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:26:48.377 --> 00:26:50.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
millions throughout the centuries

00:26:50.463 --> 00:26:53.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
have humbly submitted to Jehovah’s will,

00:26:53.132 --> 00:26:55.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
making his will their will.

00:26:55.968 --> 00:26:59.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are known as peacemakers.

00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:01.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
By sowing peace with Jehovah,

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:06.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have reaped the benefits of having
a close, personal friendship with him

00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:11.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the wonderful hope of living forever
in a peaceful new world.

00:27:11.734 --> 00:27:14.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even so, we must admit

00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:17.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it can be difficult at times to accept

00:27:17.323 --> 00:27:19.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then follow Jehovah’s direction

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:23.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
or direction that we may receive
from his organization,

00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:28.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if we don’t understand
the reasons behind the direction

00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:31.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it’s not what we might prefer.

00:27:31.962 --> 00:27:35.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is needed to sow and reap peace?

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:37.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility.

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:41.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility is defined as a “lowliness of mind,

00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:44.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
freedom from pride or arrogance.”

00:27:44.308 --> 00:27:47.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person is not self-willed,

00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:50.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they actively look for ways to sow peace

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:52.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah and others.

00:27:52.942 --> 00:27:56.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s known as a peacemaker.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:01.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the result of humility
and sowing peace?

00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:05.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Proverbs 22:4 says:

00:28:05.412 --> 00:28:08.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The result of humility
and the fear of Jehovah

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:11.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is [reaping, notice] riches

00:28:11.418 --> 00:28:14.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and glory and life.”

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:17.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, everlasting life.

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:20.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains many fine examples

00:28:20.261 --> 00:28:22.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who sowed and reaped peace

00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:26.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
by humbly submitting to Jehovah’s will.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the example of the Gibeonites.

00:28:29.812 --> 00:28:33.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Gibeonites
—weren’t they enemies of the Israelites?

00:28:33.857 --> 00:28:35.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did they humbly sow and reap peace

00:28:37.945 --> 00:28:41.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah and with his people?

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you recall,
after Joshua led the Israelites

00:28:44.743 --> 00:28:47.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
across the Jordan River
into the Promised Land,

00:28:47.705 --> 00:28:49.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah directed them to remove

00:28:49.832 --> 00:28:52.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pagan Canaanite nations
who dwelled there.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
This included the Gibeonites.

00:28:56.463 --> 00:28:58.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account at Joshua chapter 9

00:28:58.924 --> 00:29:02.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
informs us that the Gibeonites
were plainly told

00:29:02.052 --> 00:29:06.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was Jehovah’s will
that the Canaanites be annihilated.

00:29:07.474 --> 00:29:11.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel’s stunning victories
over Jericho and Ai

00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:15.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
made it very clear that Jehovah
was fighting for his people,

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:18.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Gibeonites did not want to be next.

00:29:18.694 --> 00:29:22.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what could they do
if this was Jehovah’s will?

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:26.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they devised an interesting plan.

00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:28.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sent representatives to seek peace

00:29:28.704 --> 00:29:32.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Israelites and thereby with Jehovah.

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:35.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to verse 11, they were instructed:

00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:39.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will be your servants;

00:29:39.923 --> 00:29:42.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
now make a covenant with us.”

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is what they were
to say as representatives.

00:29:45.846 --> 00:29:49.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 4 says that the Gibeonites
“acted shrewdly”

00:29:49.767 --> 00:29:52.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
by trying to trick the Israelites

00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:54.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their worn-out clothing and provisions,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
pretending that they had traveled
from a very distant land

00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:02.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
but were actually just 20 miles (30 km) away.

00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:04.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did their plan work?

00:30:04.448 --> 00:30:08.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite their deception,
yes, their plan was successful.

00:30:08.994 --> 00:30:11.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in verse 15,

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:14.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua made a covenant of peace
with the Gibeonites.

00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:18.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, this was in harmony
with Jehovah’s will

00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:21.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflected their humility

00:30:21.006 --> 00:30:25.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and desire to seek peace
with Him and his people.

00:30:25.427 --> 00:30:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
They demonstrated
their humility and submission

00:30:28.138 --> 00:30:31.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s will
and his representative, Joshua,

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:35.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following whatever direction
they received.

00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:38.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, notice the direction at verse 27;

00:30:38.565 --> 00:30:42.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Joshua made them gatherers of wood

00:30:42.236 --> 00:30:47.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and drawers of water for the assembly
and for Jehovah’s altar.”

00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:52.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the Gibeonite men
were likely skilled warriors,

00:30:52.162 --> 00:30:55.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were happy and content
to do whatever work

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:59.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were given to support pure worship.

00:30:59.128 --> 00:31:01.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly following direction

00:31:01.463 --> 00:31:04.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved their lives and brought them peace.

00:31:05.968 --> 00:31:09.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate the Gibeonites?

00:31:09.722 --> 00:31:14.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
By bringing our lives into harmony
with Jehovah’s will.

00:31:14.393 --> 00:31:17.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some, this may require
making big changes,

00:31:17.855 --> 00:31:21.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
adjusting their thinking,
giving up harmful practices,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoiding bad associates.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also imitate the Gibeonites
by being willing

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
to perform whatever assignments we are given

00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:34.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
to humbly support pure worship.

00:31:34.705 --> 00:31:36.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the lesson is clear.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sowing and reaping peace

00:31:39.168 --> 00:31:42.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires humbly following direction.

00:31:42.588 --> 00:31:46.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
This lesson is highlighted
in the following dramatization.

00:31:46.341 --> 00:31:49.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the benefits of submitting
to Jehovah’s direction.

00:31:56.935 --> 00:31:58.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,

00:31:59.438 --> 00:32:03.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pandemic lasted longer
than any of us expected,

00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:08.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the conflicting news reports
just added to the stress.

00:32:10.616 --> 00:32:13.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then my sister lost her job
and had to move in with us.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yeah, it was me

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:21.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Kelly, Nicole, and Dad.

00:32:23.253 --> 00:32:25.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty seconds, Son

00:32:25.464 --> 00:32:27.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
—twenty seconds.

00:32:34.848 --> 00:32:36.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll see you later.

00:32:36.141 --> 00:32:37.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:32:37.267 --> 00:32:39.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, where’s your mask?

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:40.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry.

00:32:40.062 --> 00:32:42.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, you can use this one. 

00:32:42.022 --> 00:32:43.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t get near anyone.

00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:45.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gary.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody at the warehouse is wearing masks.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you know how many people
have actually gotten sick?

00:32:53.116 --> 00:32:54.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:56.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far.

00:32:56.078 --> 00:32:59.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw the last Governing Body update.

00:32:59.373 --> 00:33:01.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t let down our guard.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, I get it.

00:33:03.377 --> 00:33:04.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK?

00:33:06.338 --> 00:33:10.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I think it’s great that the brothers
are trying to keep us safe.

00:33:10.968 --> 00:33:11.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
But . . .

00:33:11.885 --> 00:33:13.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what?

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:17.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think that they’re,
you know, overreacting?

00:33:34.116 --> 00:33:38.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, it wasn’t
the brothers who had the problem.

00:33:40.956 --> 00:33:42.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:33:45.168 --> 00:33:48.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
A week later, I found out that a friend
in our service group

00:33:48.714 --> 00:33:51.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
was in the hospital with COVID-19.

00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:56.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was young, and he had been taking
all the right precautions.

00:33:57.764 --> 00:34:00.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had really let my guard down.

00:34:05.188 --> 00:34:08.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is not the time

00:34:08.066 --> 00:34:12.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
to slacken our hand when it comes to safety.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:16.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let your guard down.

00:34:16.283 --> 00:34:20.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t think the virus
can’t affect you or your family.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how the organization
was really trying to protect us

00:34:26.376 --> 00:34:29.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how much my decisions
were affecting others,

00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:35.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the people I love the most.

00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:39.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the pandemic dragged on,

00:34:39.723 --> 00:34:44.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned the importance
of being humble and obedient.

00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:53.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following Jehovah’s direction
didn’t just help us stay safe,

00:34:56.698 --> 00:34:58.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
it brought us peace.

00:35:05.165 --> 00:35:07.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
What timely lessons,

00:35:07.542 --> 00:35:10.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially with all that we are facing today!

00:35:10.879 --> 00:35:13.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Gary, there are times

00:35:13.048 --> 00:35:15.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may need
to adjust our thinking on matters

00:35:15.717 --> 00:35:18.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put aside our personal opinions
and preferences

00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:23.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can loyally
and humbly follow Jehovah’s direction

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:27.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whatever direction we receive
from his representatives,

00:35:27.896 --> 00:35:30.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:35:30.816 --> 00:35:33.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gary learned an important lesson:

00:35:33.527 --> 00:35:35.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly following direction

00:35:35.654 --> 00:35:38.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t just help our family stay safe,

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
it brings us happiness and peace

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a vital lesson for us today.

00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:48.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us
to humbly follow direction now

00:35:48.709 --> 00:35:50.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as in the future?

00:35:50.752 --> 00:35:53.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the apostle Paul said

00:35:53.088 --> 00:35:57.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ephesians 5:17;

00:35:57.676 --> 00:36:00.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says: “Stop being unreasonable,

00:36:00.554 --> 00:36:03.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but keep perceiving

00:36:03.807 --> 00:36:07.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the will of Jehovah is.”

00:36:07.185 --> 00:36:11.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible clearly shows
God’s thinking on matters.

00:36:11.231 --> 00:36:14.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if it’s not so clear to us

00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:18.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we struggle to fully grasp
how it applies to us personally

00:36:18.488 --> 00:36:20.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in a given situation?

00:36:20.949 --> 00:36:22.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul advise?

00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:27.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Keep perceiving
what the will of Jehovah is.”

00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:29.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do that?

00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:33.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just as a miner keeps digging
deep below the surface of the ground

00:36:33.545 --> 00:36:35.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find precious gems,

00:36:35.547 --> 00:36:39.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must look beyond the surface
of what we read in the Bible.

00:36:39.926 --> 00:36:43.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
This requires that we keep digging deep,

00:36:43.597 --> 00:36:48.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
carefully searching for gems
in the form of Bible principles.

00:36:48.268 --> 00:36:53.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we must prayerfully meditate
on what we find.

00:36:53.065 --> 00:36:56.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jehovah’s precious thoughts

00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:59.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
will become our thoughts.

00:36:59.112 --> 00:37:01.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perceiving Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:37:01.656 --> 00:37:04.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to avoid getting
into a battle of wills,

00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:07.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can follow His direction

00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:12.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whatever direction we receive
from the Governing Body.

00:37:12.042 --> 00:37:15.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the Gibeonites, may we be peacemakers

00:37:15.545 --> 00:37:20.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
by continuing to sow peace
with Jehovah and his people.

00:37:20.342 --> 00:37:23.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we humbly make Jehovah’s will our will,

00:37:23.595 --> 00:37:27.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will joyfully reap abundant peace forever.

00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:31.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:37:31.478 --> 00:37:34.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:37:34.731 --> 00:37:38.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Gideon.”

00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:51.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man Gideon is
the Bible example we will consider.

00:37:51.081 --> 00:37:55.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is the challenge
this talk intends to address?

00:37:56.711 --> 00:37:59.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready for this?

00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:02.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Differences between fellow Christians.

00:38:02.968 --> 00:38:05.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think: ‘No, how can that be?

00:38:05.262 --> 00:38:08.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jesus said the identifying mark
of his disciples

00:38:08.306 --> 00:38:11.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be the “love among [themselves],”
not the differences.’

00:38:11.393 --> 00:38:13.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is true.

00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:15.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our Christian brotherhood,
we feel the love.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:16.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is prominent.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is dominant.

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:24.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as individuals,
we are drenched in imperfection.

00:38:24.614 --> 00:38:28.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Differences will inevitably erupt.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:32.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 3:2 doesn’t mince any words.

00:38:32.831 --> 00:38:36.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “We all [all] stumble many times.”

00:38:36.293 --> 00:38:38.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not constantly, not every day

00:38:38.295 --> 00:38:42.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but it acknowledges
that we make mistakes many times.

00:38:42.257 --> 00:38:45.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother or sister
may say something to hurt us.

00:38:45.468 --> 00:38:48.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe we push their emotional button
with words,

00:38:48.722 --> 00:38:50.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they push ours.

00:38:50.765 --> 00:38:52.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually, it’s not intentional.

00:38:52.976 --> 00:38:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often it’s a misunderstanding.

00:38:55.478 --> 00:38:58.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
We or they say something in good faith.

00:38:58.356 --> 00:39:02.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thinks it appropriate;
the other does not.

00:39:02.485 --> 00:39:05.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or possibly what we said or did

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
was perceived in a way
that we could not even have imagined.

00:39:10.202 --> 00:39:13.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it happened, and now we must

00:39:13.788 --> 00:39:17.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
sow peace in order to reap peace.

00:39:17.125 --> 00:39:19.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we plant seeds,

00:39:19.127 --> 00:39:22.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
some germinate much faster than others.

00:39:22.297 --> 00:39:24.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the opening talk of this symposium,

00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:28.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
it acknowledged that a farmer trusts

00:39:28.261 --> 00:39:31.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will see results in due time.

00:39:33.141 --> 00:39:36.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves
at odds with a fellow Christian,

00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:39.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible example of Gideon

00:39:39.022 --> 00:39:42.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to sow and reap peace.

00:39:44.152 --> 00:39:47.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Gideon was at war with the Midianites,

00:39:47.864 --> 00:39:50.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he asked his fellow worshippers,
the Ephraimites,

00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:53.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help chase them down

00:39:53.411 --> 00:39:56.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Judges chapter 8.

00:39:56.248 --> 00:39:58.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had tremendous success.

00:39:58.416 --> 00:40:00.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We say, “Great.”

00:40:00.126 --> 00:40:03.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the battle,
the Ephraimites were offended.

00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:05.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
They tried to pick a fight with Gideon.

00:40:05.173 --> 00:40:09.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
They felt that Gideon
did not call them into battle soon enough.

00:40:10.387 --> 00:40:12.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judges 8:1:

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:19.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the men of Ephraim said to him:
‘What have you done to us?

00:40:19.562 --> 00:40:23.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why did you not call us when you went
to fight against Midian?’

00:40:23.942 --> 00:40:26.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they quarreled bitterly with him.”

00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:30.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these are all armed, fighting men.

00:40:30.782 --> 00:40:33.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this difference of opinion
was allowed to escalate,

00:40:33.702 --> 00:40:36.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
it could get out of hand very quickly.

00:40:36.162 --> 00:40:38.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in this case,

00:40:38.164 --> 00:40:41.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
hand-to-hand combat might have ensued.

00:40:41.793 --> 00:40:43.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, though,

00:40:43.795 --> 00:40:47.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did Gideon sow peace with words?

00:40:47.173 --> 00:40:50.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verses 2 and 3:

00:40:50.176 --> 00:40:52.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He [Gideon] said to them:

00:40:52.262 --> 00:40:55.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What have I done compared with you?

00:40:55.890 --> 00:41:00.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are not the gleanings of Ephraim
better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?

00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:05.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was into your hand that God
gave Midian’s princes Oreb and Zeeb,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what have I done compared with you?’

00:41:10.488 --> 00:41:12.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and notice]

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he spoke this way, they calmed down.”

00:41:17.162 --> 00:41:21.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in this case,
the germination period was very short.

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:26.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon sowed peace with well-chosen words,

00:41:26.046 --> 00:41:30.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he reaped peace in one conversation.

00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:33.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:41:33.136 --> 00:41:37.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a brother prevents the situation

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
from escalating into a confrontation.

00:41:49.778 --> 00:41:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know how Jehovah’s people are.

00:41:52.489 --> 00:41:55.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
When there’s a need,

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers step up.

00:41:57.702 --> 00:41:59.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though we had

00:41:59.329 --> 00:42:01.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of work to do back then,

00:42:01.247 --> 00:42:03.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
we always had willing workers

00:42:05.293 --> 00:42:10.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so many workers that some started to feel
like they were being overlooked.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Ray!
What’s up?

00:42:17.055 --> 00:42:18.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Matt,

00:42:18.431 --> 00:42:21.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hear you’re organizing
the food distribution for our congregation.

00:42:21.393 --> 00:42:23.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I’m trying my best.

00:42:24.104 --> 00:42:26.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, can I give you a hand?
My truck is all ready to go.

00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:31.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
We actually just finished loading up
for the day, so I think we’re good.

00:42:32.987 --> 00:42:35.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, wow, yeah,
thank you very much for offering.

00:42:35.573 --> 00:42:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
When’s the next run?

00:42:39.202 --> 00:42:40.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what, Ray?

00:42:40.745 --> 00:42:41.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re about to pull out right now.

00:42:41.788 --> 00:42:43.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it OK if I call you back?

00:42:43.456 --> 00:42:45.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

00:42:50.755 --> 00:42:53.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray was such a hard worker,

00:42:53.258 --> 00:42:56.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than most of us even realized.

00:42:56.553 --> 00:42:59.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
He put his heart into every assignment.

00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:01.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was that?

00:43:01.891 --> 00:43:02.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I told him

00:43:02.767 --> 00:43:05.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
we already had all the help we needed,

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:07.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
it didn’t go the way I hoped.

00:43:07.188 --> 00:43:08.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray, I think you’re muted.

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:16.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what you’re saying is
you don’t think I’m qualified to help out.

00:43:16.739 --> 00:43:18.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, we just—

00:43:18.783 --> 00:43:21.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know how hard
you’re working caring for your mom.

00:43:21.536 --> 00:43:22.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want to . . .

00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:24.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t Paul Thompson on your crew?

00:43:24.664 --> 00:43:25.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but—

00:43:25.957 --> 00:43:27.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Oliver Kagan?

00:43:27.417 --> 00:43:28.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oliver’s my assistant, yes, but—

00:43:28.501 --> 00:43:30.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does this work, Matt?

00:43:30.044 --> 00:43:32.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you just use your friends,

00:43:32.714 --> 00:43:35.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you shut the rest of us out.

00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:38.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think I notice
how you brothers ignore me?

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:46.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray, I owe you an apology.

00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:50.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:43:51.858 --> 00:43:54.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should’ve spoken with you
about this right from the start.

00:43:56.029 --> 00:43:58.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re working so hard
taking care of your mom.

00:43:58.948 --> 00:44:01.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last thing we wanted to do
was make things harder for you.

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:05.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even more than that,

00:44:05.205 --> 00:44:08.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t want to have to ask you
to do something

00:44:08.166 --> 00:44:10.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would put you
or your mother at higher risk.

00:44:12.545 --> 00:44:14.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:44:14.005 --> 00:44:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worry about that too.

00:44:16.299 --> 00:44:18.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:44:18.343 --> 00:44:22.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
your mom
—we wouldn’t want anything to happen to her.

00:44:22.263 --> 00:44:25.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s one of our congregation treasures.

00:44:25.892 --> 00:44:27.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:44:27.894 --> 00:44:29.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re not so bad either.

00:44:32.106 --> 00:44:34.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seriously, you’re such a good example.

00:44:34.943 --> 00:44:37.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how Jehovah must feel when he sees

00:44:37.946 --> 00:44:42.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
all that you’re doing
for us and for your mom.

00:44:44.452 --> 00:44:46.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:48.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means a lot to me.

00:44:48.373 --> 00:44:51.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
If something comes up
that I can help with then

00:44:51.167 --> 00:44:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even just a little—
and I can do it from home—

00:44:55.004 --> 00:44:57.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a good point.

00:44:57.006 --> 00:44:59.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I can get your thoughts
on something, if that’s OK?

00:45:02.053 --> 00:45:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two good brothers

00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:07.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but because of imperfection,
they were both looking

00:45:07.392 --> 00:45:12.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the exact same situation
from two different perspectives.

00:45:12.355 --> 00:45:16.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt was well-intended
in what he did for Ray.

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:18.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
He realized he was caring

00:45:18.861 --> 00:45:21.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his ailing mother;
he was trying to protect him.

00:45:21.489 --> 00:45:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Ray was offended.

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:25.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even accused Matt of showing favoritism

00:45:25.868 --> 00:45:29.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his friends and ignoring others.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did this calm down?

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:34.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, thankfully,

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray went directly to Matt

00:45:37.213 --> 00:45:40.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and expressed his feelings
between the two of them alone.

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:43.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did that allow for a follow-up?

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Matt now had the opportunity

00:45:46.723 --> 00:45:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
to absorb and understand Ray’s concerns.

00:45:51.394 --> 00:45:53.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing that was!

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:57.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, what followed after that?

00:45:57.233 --> 00:46:00.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you remember, when he grasped it,

00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:04.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt paused and apologized.

00:46:04.449 --> 00:46:07.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words—like Gideon’s, well-spoken—

00:46:07.535 --> 00:46:09.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
calmed Ray down.

00:46:09.662 --> 00:46:12.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a short germination period.

00:46:12.248 --> 00:46:15.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sowed and reaped peace
in one conversation.

00:46:15.793 --> 00:46:18.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we imitate Gideon

00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:22.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there are future differences
with fellow worshippers?

00:46:22.425 --> 00:46:25.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 2:24

00:46:25.845 --> 00:46:29.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
—(And you recall that when the men of Ephraim

00:46:29.057 --> 00:46:32.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
confronted Gideon, they were confrontational.

00:46:32.727 --> 00:46:36.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were upset;
they were rattling their sabers.)

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:39.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here, Paul, in effect,

00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:42.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
summarizes for Christians Gideon’s demeanor.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 2:24:

00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:49.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For a slave of the Lord
does not need to fight,

00:46:49.911 --> 00:46:53.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you see, with words or swords,
instead like Gideon, it says]

00:46:53.373 --> 00:46:56.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but needs to be gentle toward all,

00:46:56.542 --> 00:46:59.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“qualified to teach, [and notice this]

00:46:59.003 --> 00:47:02.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing restraint when wronged.”

00:47:02.632 --> 00:47:04.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not easy to do.

00:47:04.842 --> 00:47:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
But “showing restraint when wronged”

00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a means of sowing peace.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if it’s just a minor offense,
we might ask ourselves,

00:47:15.478 --> 00:47:20.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Can I put up with this slight
to avoid a confrontation?’

00:47:20.066 --> 00:47:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, in the case with Ray,
he felt deeply hurt.

00:47:24.529 --> 00:47:27.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt realized the perspective was different.

00:47:27.407 --> 00:47:29.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you remember, in hindsight,

00:47:29.617 --> 00:47:33.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt admitted,
‘I should have talked to you first.’

00:47:33.913 --> 00:47:37.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
With those words, he planted seeds of peace.

00:47:37.917 --> 00:47:40.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, amazingly,
long before the first century,

00:47:40.837 --> 00:47:44.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon manifested

00:47:44.006 --> 00:47:47.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
what later became a Christian principle.

00:47:47.677 --> 00:47:49.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 2:3, it says:

00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:53.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With humility consider others
superior to you.”

00:47:55.101 --> 00:47:58.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember Gideon’s exact expression?

00:47:58.396 --> 00:48:00.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twice he said:

00:48:00.398 --> 00:48:04.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What have I done compared [to] you?”

00:48:04.777 --> 00:48:07.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
His humility calmed

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Ephraimites down instantly.

00:48:10.616 --> 00:48:12.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do?

00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:17.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can apologize
for our contribution to the difference,

00:48:17.457 --> 00:48:21.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if the apology is done
on the other person’s terms.

00:48:21.794 --> 00:48:23.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can pray for him.

00:48:23.296 --> 00:48:27.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can give a sincere compliment;
do something kind for the person.

00:48:27.175 --> 00:48:30.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we have a discussion,
may our words be gracious

00:48:30.887 --> 00:48:33.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the tone kindly.

00:48:33.347 --> 00:48:36.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it would be nice if all the differences
between Christians

00:48:36.934 --> 00:48:40.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have a short germination cycle.

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:44.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of circumstances, personalities,

00:48:44.484 --> 00:48:49.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the nature of the issue,
that’s not always possible.

00:48:49.489 --> 00:48:51.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may we each

00:48:51.949 --> 00:48:55.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
be determined to do our part to sow peace

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, like the farmer,
expect peace in due time.

00:49:00.666 --> 00:49:03.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, oh,

00:49:03.085 --> 00:49:07.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
how sweet restored peace truly is!

00:49:09.425 --> 00:49:13.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:16.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give the next talk
of this symposium, entitled

00:49:16.766 --> 00:49:20.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Abigail.”

00:49:29.362 --> 00:49:32.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pursuing peace can be a challenge.

00:49:32.532 --> 00:49:36.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our imperfections
and the complexities of life,

00:49:36.744 --> 00:49:41.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to work for peace,
even under normal conditions.

00:49:41.165 --> 00:49:44.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
But pursuing peace
becomes a greater challenge

00:49:44.836 --> 00:49:46.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it’s one-sided.

00:49:46.838 --> 00:49:50.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Difficulties arise in the family
and in the congregation

00:49:50.633 --> 00:49:54.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
when one person pursues peace
but the other does not.

00:49:54.595 --> 00:49:58.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the congregation,
perhaps we have a friend

00:49:58.307 --> 00:50:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has a problem with another friend
in the congregation

00:50:01.644 --> 00:50:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
but does not do anything
to reconcile the situation,

00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:07.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the family, a Christian mate

00:50:07.775 --> 00:50:10.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have difficulty pursuing peace

00:50:10.444 --> 00:50:14.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
if his or her spouse
does not apply Bible principles.

00:50:14.198 --> 00:50:16.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we do then?

00:50:16.242 --> 00:50:18.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in those situations,

00:50:18.286 --> 00:50:21.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible account of Abigail may be helpful.

00:50:21.873 --> 00:50:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to turn in your Bibles
to 1 Samuel chapter 25,

00:50:26.168 --> 00:50:30.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here we’re introduced to Abigail
and her husband, Nabal.

00:50:30.214 --> 00:50:34.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you notice here in verse 3,
Nabal is described as “harsh.”

00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:39.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 25,
Abigail describes him as ‘senseless.’

00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:43.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 17, his own worker

00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:45.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes him as “worthless”

00:50:45.187 --> 00:50:48.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and says “no one can speak [with] him.”

00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:50.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with a personality like that,

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:54.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not surprising
that he mistreats David’s young men.

00:50:54.822 --> 00:50:57.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now David wants revenge.

00:50:57.992 --> 00:51:02.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you pursue peace
in a situation like that?

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:05.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does Abigail do?

00:51:05.124 --> 00:51:07.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about it.

00:51:07.126 --> 00:51:09.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
What she could have done.

00:51:09.128 --> 00:51:12.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Abigail could have done nothing.

00:51:12.298 --> 00:51:14.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to imagine that she had

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
a difficult life as well
living with this man.

00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:19.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could have just stepped back
and let David come through

00:51:19.722 --> 00:51:21.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do what he had in mind.

00:51:21.766 --> 00:51:25.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or she could have gone out to David
and inflamed the situation,

00:51:25.853 --> 00:51:28.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe describing what a terrible man he is

00:51:28.314 --> 00:51:31.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he mistreats her as well.

00:51:31.108 --> 00:51:33.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, either of these approaches

00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:37.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have made her life easier,
but she didn’t do that.

00:51:37.406 --> 00:51:41.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Abigail could not change
her husband’s ways,

00:51:41.077 --> 00:51:45.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she did what she could
to defuse an escalating conflict.

00:51:45.915 --> 00:51:49.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, notice her respectful,
well-chosen words.

00:51:49.126 --> 00:51:51.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to 1 Samuel 25,

00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:55.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verses 27-31:

00:51:56.926 --> 00:52:01.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now let this gift that your servant girl
has brought to my lord

00:52:01.097 --> 00:52:04.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be given to the young men
who are following my lord.

00:52:04.558 --> 00:52:08.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pardon, please, the transgression
of your servant girl,

00:52:08.354 --> 00:52:13.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah will without fail make
for my lord a lasting house,

00:52:13.317 --> 00:52:16.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because my lord
is fighting the wars of Jehovah,

00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:20.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and no evil has been found
in you all your days.

00:52:20.574 --> 00:52:25.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When someone rises up to pursue you
and seeks your life,

00:52:25.329 --> 00:52:28.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the life of my lord will be wrapped securely

00:52:28.374 --> 00:52:31.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the bag of life with Jehovah your God,

00:52:31.502 --> 00:52:33.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the lives of your enemies

00:52:33.504 --> 00:52:36.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he will hurl away like stones from a sling.

00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:41.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And when Jehovah has done for my lord
all the good things he has promised

00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:44.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he appoints you as leader over Israel,

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:48.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will have no remorse
or regret in your heart

00:52:48.185 --> 00:52:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for shedding blood without cause

00:52:50.479 --> 00:52:53.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and for letting the hand
of my lord take revenge.

00:52:53.858 --> 00:52:57.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jehovah confers good upon my lord,

00:52:57.695 --> 00:53:00.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember your servant girl.”

00:53:00.614 --> 00:53:02.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you notice what Abigail does?

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
She comes in with a gift,

00:53:04.702 --> 00:53:06.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
she bows down to David,

00:53:06.704 --> 00:53:09.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
she takes the blame
for the situation herself,

00:53:09.749 --> 00:53:14.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she reasons with him
using godly principles.

00:53:14.378 --> 00:53:17.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abigail’s actions calm David

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avert a calamity.

00:53:19.925 --> 00:53:22.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
She pursued peace.

00:53:22.803 --> 00:53:26.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to do that, she had to look
beyond her own feelings

00:53:26.807 --> 00:53:29.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consider what was best
for Jehovah’s name.

00:53:29.894 --> 00:53:32.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is not always easy to do.

00:53:32.271 --> 00:53:33.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was the result?

00:53:33.939 --> 00:53:37.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because she sowed peace—she pursued peace—

00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:39.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
she reaped peace.

00:53:39.987 --> 00:53:43.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we benefit from Abigail’s example?

00:53:43.449 --> 00:53:46.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it important to do so now?

00:53:46.285 --> 00:53:49.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at the following dramatization.

00:53:54.502 --> 00:53:56.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later on,

00:53:56.504 --> 00:53:58.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
when things got even more intense,

00:53:58.547 --> 00:54:02.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when our peace
was really put to the test.

00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:07.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, Tim, you always
found a way to keep us positive.

00:54:09.016 --> 00:54:13.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I learned a lot about that
from my better half.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amy has always had a way
of bringing people together.

00:54:16.232 --> 00:54:19.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, just before the pandemic,

00:54:19.652 --> 00:54:22.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were these two pioneer sisters
in our congregation.

00:54:23.197 --> 00:54:28.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Becky was energetic, industrious,
and fearless in her ministry,

00:54:28.536 --> 00:54:32.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Lena was experienced, self-sacrificing,

00:54:32.623 --> 00:54:35.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such a good Bible teacher.

00:54:35.876 --> 00:54:38.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they didn’t exactly get along.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready to go?

00:54:55.396 --> 00:54:57.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

00:54:57.606 --> 00:54:59.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just— It’s Becky.

00:54:59.608 --> 00:55:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s just such a phantom pioneer.

00:55:02.278 --> 00:55:04.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never see her.

00:55:04.446 --> 00:55:07.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, but she just needs
to be more serious

00:55:07.199 --> 00:55:08.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
about her ministry.

00:55:08.659 --> 00:55:10.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she’s been doing
metro witnessing and . . .

00:55:10.911 --> 00:55:12.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, I know, and LDC too, right?

00:55:12.872 --> 00:55:15.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does plumbing?

00:55:15.166 --> 00:55:16.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concrete.

00:55:16.834 --> 00:55:18.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does have a lot of energy!

00:55:20.629 --> 00:55:22.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
when we used to be like that?

00:55:22.548 --> 00:55:25.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know that I was ever like Becky.

00:55:25.176 --> 00:55:26.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you weren’t.

00:55:26.719 --> 00:55:28.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were Beckyer than Becky.

00:55:28.804 --> 00:55:30.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t keep up with you

00:55:30.472 --> 00:55:33.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those long service days
in your little red car.

00:55:33.017 --> 00:55:34.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
That feels like a long time ago.

00:55:34.894 --> 00:55:36.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:43.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Becky reminds me a lot of you

00:55:43.986 --> 00:55:46.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I mean both of us—

00:55:46.197 --> 00:55:48.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
twenty years ago.

00:55:48.157 --> 00:55:50.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s working so hard,

00:55:50.492 --> 00:55:52.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s made
so many sacrifices

00:55:52.745 --> 00:55:55.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the truth,
just like you have.

00:55:57.833 --> 00:55:59.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we should get together

00:55:59.877 --> 00:56:01.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the three of us.

00:56:01.879 --> 00:56:04.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should get to know her better.

00:56:07.885 --> 00:56:11.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next week,
I had them both over to the house.

00:56:12.973 --> 00:56:15.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the more those two
got to know each other,

00:56:17.228 --> 00:56:19.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
the closer they became.

00:56:21.023 --> 00:56:25.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that proverb:
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”?

00:56:25.402 --> 00:56:28.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amy taught me what that verse really means.

00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:32.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, everyone out!

00:56:39.959 --> 00:56:42.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
When everything changed

00:56:42.336 --> 00:56:45.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we suddenly
found ourselves locked up together,

00:56:45.923 --> 00:56:49.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to show that same spirit

00:56:49.385 --> 00:56:51.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could stay united.

00:56:59.603 --> 00:57:01.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with Jehovah’s help,

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did.

00:57:09.738 --> 00:57:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did you notice what our sister did
and did not do?

00:57:13.909 --> 00:57:15.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could have done nothing.

00:57:15.661 --> 00:57:18.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could have let Lena, her service partner,

00:57:18.372 --> 00:57:20.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
cultivate those thoughts about Becky.

00:57:20.958 --> 00:57:24.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Amy could have poured fuel
on the situation,

00:57:24.295 --> 00:57:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe agreeing with Lena
or telling a few stories

00:57:27.715 --> 00:57:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how Becky annoyed her as well.

00:57:30.217 --> 00:57:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she did not do that.

00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:36.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Amy’s desire to sow peace
moved her to help Lena

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
see things from a different perspective.

00:57:39.351 --> 00:57:42.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result, the congregation benefited

00:57:42.354 --> 00:57:44.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reaped peace.

00:57:44.857 --> 00:57:48.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul explains

00:57:48.068 --> 00:57:51.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
this approach that we should take
if you turn in your Bibles

00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:55.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Romans 12:18

00:57:55.326 --> 00:57:58.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 12:18:

00:57:58.996 --> 00:58:02.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:58:02.791 --> 00:58:06.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
be peaceable with all men.”

00:58:06.045 --> 00:58:09.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As far as it depends on you”

00:58:09.465 --> 00:58:12.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
—see, our congregations
and our families benefit

00:58:12.676 --> 00:58:15.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we sow seeds of peace

00:58:15.637 --> 00:58:17.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
before matters get out of hand.

00:58:17.848 --> 00:58:20.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like seeing a small fire in our house.

00:58:20.726 --> 00:58:22.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:25.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we just ignore it—hope it goes away?

00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:28.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we fan the flames?
Do we put fuel on it?

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:29.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we do something.
Why?

00:58:29.902 --> 00:58:32.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we know that if left unchecked,

00:58:32.696 --> 00:58:36.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fire could destroy our home.

00:58:36.408 --> 00:58:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s similar when we see problems
that develop

00:58:39.495 --> 00:58:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace being disrupted.

00:58:41.455 --> 00:58:42.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do the same.
Why?

00:58:42.831 --> 00:58:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we know that if we don’t
do something and if it’s left unchecked,

00:58:47.586 --> 00:58:51.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
that disturbance could destroy our family

00:58:51.423 --> 00:58:53.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the congregation.

00:58:53.926 --> 00:58:58.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question is,
How do we sow seeds of peace?

00:58:58.222 --> 00:58:59.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Abigail was a good example.

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice what she did?

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:04.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
She considered how best
to approach the situation.

00:59:04.478 --> 00:59:06.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was proactive.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
She didn’t just hope
it would go away on its own.

00:59:09.525 --> 00:59:13.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
She used respectful, soothing speech.

00:59:13.195 --> 00:59:17.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was careful not to fan the flames
or add fuel to it

00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all good steps we can take.

00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:23.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have other resources
to help us as well.

00:59:23.122 --> 00:59:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do research in the Bible
and in our publications

00:59:26.792 --> 00:59:30.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how others have sowed peace
in similar situations,

00:59:30.546 --> 00:59:34.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can also consult with the elders.

00:59:34.508 --> 00:59:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we understand that this
is especially a challenge

00:59:38.846 --> 00:59:43.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the situation is in the family,
as it was for Abigail.

00:59:43.851 --> 00:59:46.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not easy at all.

00:59:46.228 --> 00:59:48.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in those situations,

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:51.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to focus on your mate’s good qualities,

00:59:51.733 --> 00:59:55.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on his or her irritating traits.

00:59:55.696 --> 00:59:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with all of this,
we have to be realistic.

00:59:58.991 --> 01:00:02.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what the apostle Paul said there
as recorded in verse 18.

01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said “if possible,

01:00:05.122 --> 01:00:08.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as it depends on you.”

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:11.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul is acknowledging
that peace with others

01:00:11.879 --> 01:00:14.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not always be possible.

01:00:14.339 --> 01:00:16.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do?

01:00:16.049 --> 01:00:18.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to do the best that we can,

01:00:18.218 --> 01:00:21.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we leave the rest
in Jehovah’s hands.

01:00:21.763 --> 01:00:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we be determined

01:00:24.183 --> 01:00:28.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to develop the practice
of pursuing peace now.

01:00:28.854 --> 01:00:32.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re in the congregation
or in the family,

01:00:32.232 --> 01:00:35.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be confident that if we sow peace,

01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:39.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will reap peace,
even if others don’t respond.

01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:40.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

01:00:40.449 --> 01:00:43.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll have peace with Jehovah,
peace with ourselves,

01:00:43.785 --> 01:00:47.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the knowledge
that we did the right thing.

01:00:47.122 --> 01:00:50.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, when in the future

01:00:50.501 --> 01:00:53.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
a force for peace is vitally needed,

01:00:53.837 --> 01:00:56.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be prepared to provide it.

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:01.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother William Malenfant,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:04.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Mephibosheth.”

01:01:16.985 --> 01:01:20.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inherited imperfection

01:01:20.197 --> 01:01:24.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we don’t like it, but we all have it.

01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:26.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since imperfection means

01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:30.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everyone is less than perfect,

01:01:30.332 --> 01:01:34.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are bound to be treated unfairly at times,

01:01:34.503 --> 01:01:37.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
even by fellow Christians.

01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
In rare cases, one might become
the victim of slander

01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:44.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even fraud.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider with me an account about slander

01:01:48.308 --> 01:01:52.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
that occurred in the nation of Israel
in the days of King David.

01:01:52.938 --> 01:01:56.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s about a man named Mephibosheth

01:01:56.358 --> 01:02:01.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was slandered by a man named Ziba.

01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:03.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Examining the way

01:02:03.156 --> 01:02:06.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Mephibosheth handled this matter

01:02:06.577 --> 01:02:10.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be of real help to us to sow peace

01:02:10.414 --> 01:02:12.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to reap peace.

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:17.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonathan was Mephibosheth’s father,

01:02:17.588 --> 01:02:20.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and King Saul was his grandfather.

01:02:20.924 --> 01:02:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jonathan and Saul died,

01:02:23.844 --> 01:02:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
King David gave to Mephibosheth

01:02:26.972 --> 01:02:29.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the land of his grandfather.

01:02:30.767 --> 01:02:33.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
David assigned Ziba as a servant

01:02:33.854 --> 01:02:35.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take care of the land

01:02:35.856 --> 01:02:38.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had given to Mephibosheth.

01:02:38.984 --> 01:02:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, a rebellion
in David’s household

01:02:43.572 --> 01:02:46.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
forced him to flee from Jerusalem,

01:02:46.575 --> 01:02:50.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Ziba went out to meet David.

01:02:50.621 --> 01:02:54.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David asked Ziba about Mephibosheth

01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:57.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why he didn’t come with Ziba

01:02:57.294 --> 01:02:59.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show his support for David,

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ziba slandered Mephibosheth,

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:07.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that he was seeking the kingship
for himself.

01:03:08.597 --> 01:03:13.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sad to say, David believed the slander

01:03:13.143 --> 01:03:17.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave Mephibosheth’s land to Ziba.

01:03:18.565 --> 01:03:23.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, Mephibosheth
met with King David

01:03:23.362 --> 01:03:26.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
and explained why he didn’t show up

01:03:26.323 --> 01:03:28.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
to travel with him.

01:03:28.492 --> 01:03:32.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told David that Ziba had lied about him.

01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:36.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon hearing
Mephibosheth’s side of the story,

01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:38.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
David now decided

01:03:38.835 --> 01:03:43.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he and Ziba should share the land.

01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of complaining or seeking vengeance,

01:03:48.011 --> 01:03:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth displayed

01:03:50.138 --> 01:03:54.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spiritual qualities of a peacemaker,

01:03:54.226 --> 01:03:57.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was willing to be wronged.

01:03:57.813 --> 01:04:00.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to David, as recorded

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:04.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel chapter 19

01:04:04.986 --> 01:04:07.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 30,

01:04:07.239 --> 01:04:10.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
these words:

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this Mephibosheth said to the king:

01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:16.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let him take it all,

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘now that my lord the king

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:22.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
has come to his house in peace.’”

01:04:22.045 --> 01:04:25.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Mephibosheth was more concerned

01:04:25.465 --> 01:04:27.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
about David’s kingship

01:04:27.592 --> 01:04:29.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
than he was about himself.

01:04:31.012 --> 01:04:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:04:33.849 --> 01:04:36.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a brother reacts

01:04:36.476 --> 01:04:38.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a perceived injustice

01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:40.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereafter

01:04:40.939 --> 01:04:44.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he sows peace with his brothers.

01:04:50.824 --> 01:04:52.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first time we met David,

01:04:52.993 --> 01:04:54.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were in chains!

01:04:54.995 --> 01:04:58.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d seen a lot of things
during my time as a guard,

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:03.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
but nothing like the peace that you all had.

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:05.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prison chains may be strong,

01:05:05.297 --> 01:05:08.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we all had something much stronger.

01:05:09.885 --> 01:05:12.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we had to work for that peace.

01:05:12.262 --> 01:05:14.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right, Phil?

01:05:14.556 --> 01:05:16.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

01:05:17.267 --> 01:05:21.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, there was a misunderstanding

01:05:21.813 --> 01:05:24.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
that got blown all out of proportion.

01:05:26.485 --> 01:05:28.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t handle it the best.

01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:34.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more I tried to defend myself,
the worse it became.

01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:38.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

01:05:39.498 --> 01:05:41.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t true.

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know me!

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:51.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t prepared
for how far it would go.

01:05:51.968 --> 01:05:54.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one more announcement.

01:05:54.054 --> 01:05:57.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Philip Kim
is no longer serving as an elder.

01:05:59.392 --> 01:06:01.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that brings our meeting to a close.

01:06:01.645 --> 01:06:02.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we can stand.

01:06:03.647 --> 01:06:06.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next few months were a real struggle.

01:06:07.943 --> 01:06:10.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when more details came to light,

01:06:10.779 --> 01:06:12.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I’d be reappointed,

01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:15.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I wasn’t.

01:06:22.207 --> 01:06:23.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil!

01:06:23.625 --> 01:06:24.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand why.

01:06:25.627 --> 01:06:26.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil, come on . . .

01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:30.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt bitterness growing inside.

01:06:31.299 --> 01:06:32.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil, you know . . .

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything became about me

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:48.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how I felt, what I deserved.

01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:54.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a fog that stopped me
from seeing what Jehovah deserved,

01:06:55.198 --> 01:06:57.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I really needed his help.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort
in accounts of Jehovah’s servants

01:07:03.206 --> 01:07:06.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were either misunderstood or misjudged

01:07:08.712 --> 01:07:10.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maintained their loyalty to Him.

01:07:17.888 --> 01:07:21.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me realize that it’s a privilege

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be in Jehovah’s organization.

01:07:25.562 --> 01:07:27.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being at peace with my brothers

01:07:27.939 --> 01:07:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important
than any appointed position.

01:07:33.737 --> 01:07:38.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without peace, I don’t know
how we could’ve managed what was to come.

01:07:48.209 --> 01:07:50.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your arthritis bad today?

01:07:50.795 --> 01:07:52.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I’ll be your secretary

01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:56.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Baruch was to Jeremiah.

01:07:56.468 --> 01:07:58.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what I’d do without you.

01:08:05.977 --> 01:08:09.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question now for all of us is,

01:08:09.356 --> 01:08:12.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate the example

01:08:12.651 --> 01:08:14.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Mephibosheth?

01:08:14.694 --> 01:08:18.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, if you are the victim

01:08:18.365 --> 01:08:23.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
of minor gossip or rude treatment by someone,

01:08:23.161 --> 01:08:26.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not choose to let it pass

01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:29.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not make a big issue of it?

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:33.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that what 1 Peter 4:8 advises?

01:08:33.713 --> 01:08:37.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 4:8 reads:

01:08:37.008 --> 01:08:39.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Above all things,

01:08:39.552 --> 01:08:43.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
have intense love for one another.”

01:08:43.306 --> 01:08:46.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it tells us what our love can do.

01:08:46.351 --> 01:08:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

01:08:48.645 --> 01:08:53.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because love covers a multitude of sins.”

01:08:53.525 --> 01:08:57.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, love covers sins and imperfections

01:08:57.988 --> 01:09:00.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are willing

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let love have its way.

01:09:03.159 --> 01:09:06.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if you are the victim

01:09:06.538 --> 01:09:09.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a more serious injustice?

01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:12.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the brother in the video

01:09:12.127 --> 01:09:15.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt that he was a victim of injustice

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:18.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was deleted as an elder.

01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:20.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tried to clarify matters,

01:09:20.802 --> 01:09:25.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since he didn’t get the response
he was hoping for,

01:09:25.265 --> 01:09:28.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
he became very upset.

01:09:28.059 --> 01:09:32.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lost his peace, and he caused others

01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:35.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lose their peaceful relationship with him.

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:39.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
To regain his peace,

01:09:39.195 --> 01:09:42.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother dug into the Scriptures,

01:09:42.032 --> 01:09:45.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for examples he could benefit from.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:50.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he prayerfully looked to Jehovah
to help him.

01:09:51.332 --> 01:09:55.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could see the importance of self-control

01:09:55.462 --> 01:09:59.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being guided by God’s spirit.

01:09:59.132 --> 01:10:04.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, he was able
to be at peace with himself

01:10:04.137 --> 01:10:08.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sow peace with his brothers.

01:10:08.141 --> 01:10:12.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think for a moment
about the unfair decision David made

01:10:12.979 --> 01:10:15.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he told Mephibosheth

01:10:15.315 --> 01:10:19.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he and Ziba were to share the land.

01:10:19.527 --> 01:10:24.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ziba was the cause of the problem,
not Mephibosheth.

01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Mephibosheth

01:10:27.243 --> 01:10:31.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
displayed the qualities of a spiritual man

01:10:31.164 --> 01:10:34.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not looking out for his own interests,

01:10:34.667 --> 01:10:36.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being patient,

01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:40.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by not seeking vengeance.

01:10:40.173 --> 01:10:42.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me

01:10:42.175 --> 01:10:46.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel chapter 19,

01:10:46.054 --> 01:10:50.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 25 through verse 28

01:10:50.016 --> 01:10:54.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Samuel 19:25-28; it reads:

01:10:54.896 --> 01:10:57.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he came to Jerusalem

01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:00.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, Mephibosheth went to Jerusalem]

01:11:00.777 --> 01:11:02.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to meet the king,

01:11:02.779 --> 01:11:07.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the king said to him: ‘Why did you not go
with me, Mephibosheth?’

01:11:07.784 --> 01:11:09.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this he said:

01:11:09.786 --> 01:11:13.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My lord the king, my servant tricked me.

01:11:13.581 --> 01:11:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For your servant had said,

01:11:15.792 --> 01:11:17.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Let me get my donkey saddled

01:11:17.836 --> 01:11:21.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that I may ride on it
and go with the king,”

01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:24.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for your servant is crippled.

01:11:24.467 --> 01:11:28.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But he slandered your servant
to my lord the king.

01:11:28.429 --> 01:11:33.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘However, my lord the king
is like an angel of the true God,

01:11:33.268 --> 01:11:37.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so do whatever seems good to you.

01:11:37.147 --> 01:11:39.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘All the household of my father

01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:42.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘could have been doomed to death
by my lord the king,

01:11:42.902 --> 01:11:47.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and yet you placed your servant
among those eating at your table.

01:11:47.824 --> 01:11:50.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘So what right do I have

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cry out further to the king?’”

01:11:54.122 --> 01:11:56.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s truly remarkable.

01:11:56.124 --> 01:11:59.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth was grateful for what he had,

01:11:59.752 --> 01:12:01.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was seeking nothing more.

01:12:01.921 --> 01:12:04.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
He enjoyed peace of mind and heart.

01:12:06.301 --> 01:12:09.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a matter involving slander

01:12:09.095 --> 01:12:11.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fraud arises today,

01:12:11.598 --> 01:12:15.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Christian may choose to follow
Jesus’ instructions

01:12:15.101 --> 01:12:18.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 18:15-17.

01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:20.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, if for some reason,

01:12:20.815 --> 01:12:25.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
following that procedure
does not fully resolve the matter,

01:12:25.028 --> 01:12:28.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she may choose to pursue it no further

01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:30.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suffer a loss

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than disturb the peace
of the congregation.

01:12:35.371 --> 01:12:40.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can leave any unresolved issues
with Jehovah,

01:12:40.335 --> 01:12:43.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that he sees what we do

01:12:43.046 --> 01:12:45.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what others do,

01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:49.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will carry out justice
at the right time.

01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:52.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our own benefit,

01:12:52.847 --> 01:12:57.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
we really must try to let go of resentment.

01:12:57.227 --> 01:13:01.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do, we benefit ourselves.

01:13:01.522 --> 01:13:04.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we forgive, we forgive others

01:13:04.943 --> 01:13:07.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah forgives us.

01:13:07.278 --> 01:13:10.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that doesn’t mean
that we minimize or excuse

01:13:10.323 --> 01:13:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wrong conduct of fellow believers.

01:13:12.408 --> 01:13:14.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:13:14.035 --> 01:13:17.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it does mean that we imitate Mephibosheth

01:13:17.497 --> 01:13:20.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
by letting go of resentment

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pursuing peace.

01:13:22.877 --> 01:13:25.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
We draw closer to Jehovah

01:13:25.672 --> 01:13:29.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following the advice at Psalm 55:22:

01:13:29.968 --> 01:13:33.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Throw your burden on Jehovah,

01:13:33.054 --> 01:13:35.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will sustain you.

01:13:35.348 --> 01:13:38.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never will he allow
the righteous one to fall.”

01:13:39.894 --> 01:13:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Romans 15:13 assures us,

01:13:43.314 --> 01:13:48.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “fill you with all joy and peace

01:13:48.027 --> 01:13:51.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
by your trusting in him.”

01:13:52.865 --> 01:13:57.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

01:13:57.161 --> 01:14:01.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

01:14:01.499 --> 01:14:04.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace

01:14:04.877 --> 01:14:07.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Paul and Barnabas.”

01:14:15.138 --> 01:14:18.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the next challenge we’ll discuss?

01:14:18.558 --> 01:14:22.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a disagreement between elders.

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:25.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re an elder,
have you experienced that?

01:14:25.315 --> 01:14:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were voices raised?

01:14:27.483 --> 01:14:29.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did tempers flare?

01:14:29.694 --> 01:14:34.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has a friendship
with a fellow elder cooled off?

01:14:34.073 --> 01:14:37.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though we rightly expect
appointed brothers to be exemplary,

01:14:37.994 --> 01:14:41.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fact is that all of us, including elders,

01:14:41.414 --> 01:14:43.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
are still imperfect.

01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:47.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Differences in backgrounds,
personalities, experiences, and opinions

01:14:47.962 --> 01:14:50.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to disagreements.

01:14:50.214 --> 01:14:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a disagreement, if not resolved,

01:14:52.508 --> 01:14:56.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
can disrupt our peace and that of others.

01:14:56.054 --> 01:14:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this talk, we’ll consider
how two elders in the first century,

01:14:59.515 --> 01:15:03.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul and Barnabas, sowed and reaped peace.

01:15:03.811 --> 01:15:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how their example
can help appointed men today,

01:15:07.398 --> 01:15:12.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
including all of you dear elders,
to resolve a disagreement.

01:15:13.154 --> 01:15:16.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible with me
to Acts chapter 15

01:15:16.157 --> 01:15:19.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and read together verses 36 to 39.

01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:24.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the reading, please note the problem
that arose between Paul and Barnabas.

01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:28.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Acts chapter 15,
beginning in verse 36:

01:15:29.754 --> 01:15:33.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After some days, Paul said to Barnabas:

01:15:33.424 --> 01:15:37.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let us now return and visit the brothers
in every one of the cities

01:15:37.553 --> 01:15:41.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where we proclaimed the word of Jehovah,
to see how they are.’

01:15:41.682 --> 01:15:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Barnabas was determined
to take along John, who was called Mark.

01:15:46.562 --> 01:15:51.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul, however, was not in favor
of taking him along with them,

01:15:51.484 --> 01:15:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seeing that he had departed
from them in Pamphylia

01:15:54.737 --> 01:15:57.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and had not gone with them to the work.

01:15:57.865 --> 01:16:02.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this there was a sharp burst of anger,

01:16:02.829 --> 01:16:05.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they separated from each other;

01:16:05.248 --> 01:16:09.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Barnabas took Mark along
and sailed away to Cyprus.”

01:16:09.961 --> 01:16:11.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the problem?

01:16:11.963 --> 01:16:15.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
These two elders strongly disagreed

01:16:15.049 --> 01:16:19.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
about whether to take Mark with them
on their next missionary tour.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:23.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, expressing
a difference of opinion is not always wrong.

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:27.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 7 of this same chapter
reports that the apostles

01:16:27.353 --> 01:16:30.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and older men in Jerusalem
had an “intense discussion”

01:16:30.773 --> 01:16:33.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to a good outcome.

01:16:33.192 --> 01:16:36.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in this case, what resulted?

01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:38.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please look again at verse 39.

01:16:38.948 --> 01:16:41.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be nice to read,

01:16:41.033 --> 01:16:44.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this Paul and Barnabas prayed to Jehovah

01:16:44.036 --> 01:16:46.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and came to an agreement.”

01:16:46.038 --> 01:16:50.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, though,
their discussion on this occasion

01:16:50.293 --> 01:16:53.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
led to a “sharp burst of anger,

01:16:53.588 --> 01:16:56.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they separated.”

01:16:56.007 --> 01:17:00.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, their friendship
was affected by a temporary strain.

01:17:01.846 --> 01:17:04.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say “temporary”?

01:17:04.599 --> 01:17:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in time, 
it appears that Paul and Barnabas

01:17:08.311 --> 01:17:10.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
put this matter behind them.

01:17:10.897 --> 01:17:14.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
A short time later
in Paul’s letter to the Galatians,

01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wrote about Barnabas
and the activity they had enjoyed together.

01:17:18.654 --> 01:17:22.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul did not bring up their dispute.

01:17:22.074 --> 01:17:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, when Paul later wrote
to the Colossians and then to Timothy,

01:17:27.079 --> 01:17:30.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul spoke well of Mark.

01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in Paul’s last inspired letter,
the second to Timothy, he wrote this:

01:17:35.004 --> 01:17:39.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Bring Mark along with you,
for he is helpful to me in the ministry.”

01:17:39.884 --> 01:17:42.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it seems that Paul and Barnabas

01:17:42.762 --> 01:17:45.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
resolved their disagreement.

01:17:45.723 --> 01:17:48.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s think about that, brothers.

01:17:48.142 --> 01:17:50.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
What made that possible?

01:17:50.895 --> 01:17:55.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s this: Long before their disagreement,

01:17:55.066 --> 01:17:58.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had shared together
in an exciting ministry.

01:17:58.361 --> 01:18:00.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
For years, they were united

01:18:00.988 --> 01:18:04.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what the Bible calls a “bond of peace.”

01:18:04.534 --> 01:18:08.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though their friendship
experienced strain,

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
the bond between them was strong

01:18:10.498 --> 01:18:13.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
—strong enough to withstand the stress.

01:18:14.794 --> 01:18:17.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s bring this to our day.

01:18:17.338 --> 01:18:19.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:22.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
please notice how an elder sows peace.

01:18:29.267 --> 01:18:31.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know, there is more to the story.

01:18:31.894 --> 01:18:33.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil didn’t know just

01:18:33.896 --> 01:18:36.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
how tense things were between Tim and I.

01:18:37.483 --> 01:18:39.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
No idea.

01:18:39.777 --> 01:18:42.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never talked,

01:18:42.655 --> 01:18:45.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean really talked, about it

01:18:45.825 --> 01:18:47.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it was too late.

01:18:59.672 --> 01:19:01.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

01:19:01.966 --> 01:19:04.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to talk.

01:19:06.262 --> 01:19:09.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we need to seriously reconsider
Phil’s qualifications.

01:19:09.557 --> 01:19:11.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know he’s not
the type of brother that . . .

01:19:11.183 --> 01:19:14.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enough. Enough!
Enough about Phil.

01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:15.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know he’s your friend, . . .

01:19:15.563 --> 01:19:16.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friend?

01:19:16.147 --> 01:19:18.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . but the body agreed that he
no longer qualified to serve as an elder.

01:19:18.566 --> 01:19:19.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friend?
Friend?

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s worked with us for years!

01:19:22.862 --> 01:19:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
The body decided, unanimously,

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:26.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he should no longer serve.

01:19:26.866 --> 01:19:28.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you pushed them!

01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:32.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

01:19:32.496 --> 01:19:35.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s enough that we have
those outside the congregation

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:37.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting pressure on us;
we do not need more in here!

01:19:37.084 --> 01:19:38.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think . . .

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conversation
—the argument—

01:19:44.592 --> 01:19:46.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was terrible.

01:19:46.886 --> 01:19:48.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both said things we didn’t mean.

01:19:50.389 --> 01:19:54.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after that,
we both handled the situation poorly.

01:20:11.452 --> 01:20:13.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
We needed to make things right.

01:20:32.682 --> 01:20:34.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy,

01:20:36.268 --> 01:20:38.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we talked it out.

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:43.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we made peace with Jehovah’s help.

01:20:46.904 --> 01:20:50.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what it would have been like
in that cellblock if we hadn’t?

01:20:51.575 --> 01:20:56.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
We finally told Phil the whole story
once we were all roommates.

01:20:57.081 --> 01:20:58.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:01.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re ready!

01:21:01.627 --> 01:21:03.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go sing.

01:21:03.254 --> 01:21:08.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an island of calm
In dark stormy seas,

01:21:08.050 --> 01:21:13.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people are living in peace.

01:21:13.639 --> 01:21:20.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our eyes of faith,
We see beyond the clouds

01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that the storm soon will cease.

01:21:25.735 --> 01:21:32.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

01:21:32.658 --> 01:21:36.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:39.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below . . .

01:21:42.835 --> 01:21:47.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, here’s the question
before all of us now:

01:21:47.006 --> 01:21:50.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Paul and Barnabas?

01:21:50.718 --> 01:21:55.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, as elders,
we must apply Scriptural counsel

01:21:55.473 --> 01:21:58.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our dealings with one another.

01:21:58.309 --> 01:22:03.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, we just saw how imperfection
got the better of Tim and Carl

01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their body language,
choice of words, tone of voice.

01:22:07.234 --> 01:22:11.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Tim put it,
‘The argument was terrible.’

01:22:11.739 --> 01:22:14.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the dispute,

01:22:14.033 --> 01:22:17.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did those two elders
eventually do right?

01:22:17.953 --> 01:22:22.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
They applied Scriptural counsel
and made peace.

01:22:22.082 --> 01:22:26.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the divine counsel at James 3:17

01:22:26.504 --> 01:22:30.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds all of us
to be “peaceable [and] reasonable.” 

01:22:30.591 --> 01:22:34.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> once suggested
how this could be applied to elders.

01:22:34.762 --> 01:22:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
I quote: “Peacemakers
modestly express their thoughts

01:22:39.642 --> 01:22:42.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and then respectfully listen
to those of others.

01:22:42.853 --> 01:22:45.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Instead of insisting on his own way,

01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:49.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a peacemaker will prayerfully consider
his brother’s viewpoint.

01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:52.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If no Bible principle is violated,

01:22:52.196 --> 01:22:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there is usually room
for varied points of view. 

01:22:55.658 --> 01:23:00.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Experienced overseers
know that preserving the peace

01:23:00.412 --> 01:23:04.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more important
than getting one’s own way.”

01:23:04.792 --> 01:23:06.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful thought!

01:23:06.961 --> 01:23:08.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s our first lesson?

01:23:08.963 --> 01:23:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we as elders apply Scriptural counsel

01:23:12.508 --> 01:23:14.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our dealings with one another,

01:23:14.552 --> 01:23:19.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll never allow a difference of opinion
to become a cause for animosity.

01:23:20.724 --> 01:23:25.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 12:10 outlines a second lesson.

01:23:25.145 --> 01:23:27.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible with me there.

01:23:27.523 --> 01:23:32.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under inspiration, at Romans 12:10,

01:23:32.027 --> 01:23:33.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote this:

01:23:33.946 --> 01:23:36.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In brotherly love

01:23:36.448 --> 01:23:40.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have tender affection for one another.

01:23:40.327 --> 01:23:45.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

01:23:45.165 --> 01:23:50.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers (elders), now,
before life gets even more difficult,

01:23:50.045 --> 01:23:52.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is what we need to do.

01:23:52.047 --> 01:23:56.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to strengthen
love and affection for one another.

01:23:56.969 --> 01:24:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do that by continuing to speak well

01:24:00.556 --> 01:24:03.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our fellow elders
in public and in private,

01:24:03.726 --> 01:24:07.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
by resisting the urge to talk negatively
to other elders

01:24:07.563 --> 01:24:09.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
about any disagreements that arise,

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:14.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by regularly reflecting
on our brothers’ good qualities

01:24:14.737 --> 01:24:18.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on our past service together.

01:24:18.365 --> 01:24:22.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, weren’t we happy
to see how Tim and Carl

01:24:22.161 --> 01:24:26.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
imitated Paul and Barnabas
and eventually reaped peace?

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:30.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though not easy,
they applied Scriptural counsel

01:24:30.294 --> 01:24:32.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resolved their problem.

01:24:32.671 --> 01:24:37.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
That warm smile on Carl’s face
when he showed up at Tim’s home,

01:24:37.635 --> 01:24:41.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dessert (perhaps Tim’s favorite pie),

01:24:41.555 --> 01:24:43.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
the heart-to-heart talk,

01:24:43.974 --> 01:24:48.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their lasting friendship, even in prison,

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed that they maintained
their love and affection for each other.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:59.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers, elders, may we do likewise.

01:24:59.406 --> 01:25:03.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s settle disagreements
quickly and peacefully.

01:25:03.077 --> 01:25:07.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do so, we’ll reap not only peace,

01:25:07.206 --> 01:25:10.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’ll prove to be examples to the flock,

01:25:10.334 --> 01:25:12.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Paul and Barnabas.

01:25:13.963 --> 01:25:16.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Stephen Lett,
a member of the Governing Body,

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider the final talk
of this symposium,

01:25:20.302 --> 01:25:25.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Modern-Day Examples.”

01:25:33.148 --> 01:25:35.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do many people react

01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:38.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they see corruption and injustice?

01:25:38.445 --> 01:25:41.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
They become incensed,
and they want to fix the problem.

01:25:41.907 --> 01:25:44.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they try to fix the problem?

01:25:44.159 --> 01:25:48.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
By becoming involved
in political efforts or social movements

01:25:48.789 --> 01:25:53.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
that claim to fight corruption and injustice.

01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:55.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,

01:25:55.212 --> 01:25:57.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do Jehovah’s Witnesses not get involved

01:25:57.715 --> 01:26:01.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
in political efforts or social movements?

01:26:01.135 --> 01:26:05.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simple answer is
because they’ve learned from God’s Word

01:26:05.389 --> 01:26:09.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the problems of this world
cannot be corrected.

01:26:09.893 --> 01:26:12.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 1:15 says:

01:26:12.938 --> 01:26:17.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What is crooked cannot be made straight.”

01:26:17.609 --> 01:26:21.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan’s world around us
is like the trunk of a tree

01:26:21.196 --> 01:26:25.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has grown so crooked, twisted, gnarled

01:26:25.534 --> 01:26:28.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it cannot be made straight.

01:26:28.162 --> 01:26:30.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have learned

01:26:30.456 --> 01:26:33.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it would be futile
to spend our time and energy

01:26:33.625 --> 01:26:38.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to correct what Jehovah tells us
cannot be corrected.

01:26:38.338 --> 01:26:43.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, Jehovah’s Witnesses
have learned how and where

01:26:43.135 --> 01:26:46.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
real peace can be found even now.

01:26:46.972 --> 01:26:48.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard,

01:26:48.974 --> 01:26:51.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s consider two modern-day examples

01:26:51.769 --> 01:26:55.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
of ones who came
to acquire Jehovah’s thinking

01:26:55.439 --> 01:26:57.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this matter.

01:26:57.441 --> 01:27:01.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about Egidio Nahakbria

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:03.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Frede Bruun.

01:27:03.197 --> 01:27:05.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first Egidio

01:27:05.616 --> 01:27:08.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
—born in a remote part of East Timor,

01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:12.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
he experienced horrible
guerrilla warfare during his childhood.

01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:16.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of his neighbors
disappeared or were killed,

01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:18.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he feared he would be next.

01:27:18.879 --> 01:27:22.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some years later,
he moved to the capital city

01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:24.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
and entered a university

01:27:24.468 --> 01:27:29.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he met many other youths
with backgrounds similar to his.

01:27:29.389 --> 01:27:34.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He became part of a student group
that was trying to achieve social change

01:27:34.394 --> 01:27:36.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
through political action.

01:27:36.855 --> 01:27:40.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many political demonstrations were organized,

01:27:40.526 --> 01:27:44.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
but most ended up in riots,

01:27:44.196 --> 01:27:46.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many of his friends injured.

01:27:46.406 --> 01:27:48.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were even killed.

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then through a relative
who was studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:27:52.704 --> 01:27:55.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Egidio started to study.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s what he said
as he started this study:

01:27:58.669 --> 01:28:01.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As I studied the Bible,

01:28:01.046 --> 01:28:05.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I began to feel that I had 
never really known love.

01:28:05.884 --> 01:28:09.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Despite my rough
appearance and disposition,

01:28:09.179 --> 01:28:11.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Witnesses treated me
with ‘fellow feeling’

01:28:11.974 --> 01:28:14.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ‘brotherly affection.’”

01:28:14.434 --> 01:28:18.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, soon he was baptized,
became a regular pioneer,

01:28:18.272 --> 01:28:20.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was so happy because now he knew

01:28:20.816 --> 01:28:23.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was truly helping people.

01:28:23.902 --> 01:28:27.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
He ended his life story with these words:

01:28:27.781 --> 01:28:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the past,
 I felt angry, unloved, and unlovable.

01:28:32.786 --> 01:28:35.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But thanks to Jehovah,

01:28:35.038 --> 01:28:39.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
at last I have found true love and peace!”

01:28:40.711 --> 01:28:43.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s talk about Frede.

01:28:43.005 --> 01:28:45.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
From an early age,
he was very upset

01:28:45.507 --> 01:28:48.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
by all the hatred, bloodshed,
and war he saw around him.

01:28:48.969 --> 01:28:53.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
But especially was he disturbed
by religion’s role in all of this.

01:28:53.974 --> 01:28:57.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
He observed that much
of this hatred, bloodshed, and war

01:28:57.936 --> 01:29:00.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
was encouraged, supported,

01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:03.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at least condoned by religion.

01:29:03.692 --> 01:29:08.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1955, he attended
a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:29:08.697 --> 01:29:13.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after the convention,
he accepted a Bible study.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, during his studies,
he learned many wonderful things,

01:29:15.996 --> 01:29:18.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
but something he learned
really motivated him.

01:29:18.498 --> 01:29:21.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned the identity

01:29:21.043 --> 01:29:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the “great prostitute,”
Babylon the Great,

01:29:24.671 --> 01:29:28.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Revelation chapters 17 and 18.

01:29:28.592 --> 01:29:31.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned that this prostitute

01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:34.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the world empire of false religion.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he was really amazed

01:29:36.642 --> 01:29:40.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was shown Revelation 18:24,

01:29:40.479 --> 01:29:45.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:
“In her [the prostitute] was found the blood

01:29:45.025 --> 01:29:49.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those
who have been slaughtered on the earth.”

01:29:49.071 --> 01:29:52.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he learned that the world’s religions

01:29:52.491 --> 01:29:56.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
could never be a force
for international peace

01:29:56.161 --> 01:29:59.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they take sides,
they’re divided,

01:29:59.414 --> 01:30:01.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they go to war.

01:30:01.917 --> 01:30:05.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
he saw that Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:30:05.504 --> 01:30:08.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
are an international brotherhood

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:11.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
that truly practices what Jesus taught.

01:30:11.468 --> 01:30:14.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frede’s progress was very fast.

01:30:14.554 --> 01:30:19.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
He got baptized, started pioneering, 
attended the 50th class of Gilead,

01:30:19.434 --> 01:30:22.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has served many years in Guatemala,

01:30:22.062 --> 01:30:24.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping people (as he was helped)

01:30:24.731 --> 01:30:28.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find the true Source of peace.

01:30:29.486 --> 01:30:30.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

01:30:30.904 --> 01:30:34.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are lessons we can learn
from Egidio and Frede?

01:30:34.866 --> 01:30:37.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many,
but here are three big ones.

01:30:37.536 --> 01:30:39.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

01:30:39.371 --> 01:30:42.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can never correct the corruption

01:30:42.749 --> 01:30:45.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and injustice of this world

01:30:45.377 --> 01:30:50.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of political efforts
or social movements.

01:30:50.215 --> 01:30:53.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
That reminds me
of the illustration a brother used

01:30:53.051 --> 01:30:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
about trying to get rid of a problem

01:30:55.137 --> 01:30:59.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
with spiderwebs but being unable 
to get rid of the spider.

01:30:59.141 --> 01:31:00.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knock the webs down;

01:31:00.767 --> 01:31:02.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spider builds them right back.

01:31:02.394 --> 01:31:04.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knock them down;
it builds them back.

01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:06.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
You never get rid of the problem.

01:31:06.023 --> 01:31:10.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this illustration,
Satan is the spider.

01:31:10.861 --> 01:31:15.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since he’s the source
of corruption and injustice,

01:31:15.115 --> 01:31:19.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
as long as he exists,
the problem will exist.

01:31:19.036 --> 01:31:21.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little puny humans can’t get rid of Satan.

01:31:21.538 --> 01:31:23.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s superhuman,

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:27.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the solution must also be superhuman.

01:31:27.294 --> 01:31:30.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s where God’s Kingdom comes in.

01:31:30.672 --> 01:31:35.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom can and will
not only get rid of the webs

01:31:35.093 --> 01:31:39.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the old spider Satan himself too.

01:31:39.181 --> 01:31:41.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now here’s our second lesson:

01:31:41.516 --> 01:31:44.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must remember that political activism

01:31:44.895 --> 01:31:49.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
often leads to violence,
which is the opposite of peace.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:52.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pursue peace
—don’t we?—

01:31:52.486 --> 01:31:56.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
not conduct that often leads to violence.

01:31:56.156 --> 01:31:58.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our third lesson:

01:31:58.158 --> 01:32:01.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the religions of this world,

01:32:01.411 --> 01:32:05.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must promote peace with all people,

01:32:05.791 --> 01:32:10.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
which definitely means
we refuse to get involved in any way

01:32:10.087 --> 01:32:13.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the wars of Satan’s world.

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
That reminds me of an experience
a young brother had in the ministry.

01:32:17.469 --> 01:32:20.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
A very emotional woman said to him:

01:32:20.806 --> 01:32:23.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My son died

01:32:23.225 --> 01:32:26.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you to have the freedom you have.

01:32:26.728 --> 01:32:30.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why won’t you fight for your country?”

01:32:30.315 --> 01:32:33.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, very calmly,
the young brother said:

01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:36.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m very sorry
about the loss of your dear son.

01:32:36.988 --> 01:32:39.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But one thing I can guarantee you

01:32:39.658 --> 01:32:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is that it was not
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:32:43.412 --> 01:32:45.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who killed your son.

01:32:45.664 --> 01:32:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I don’t know if you can make
that guarantee about your religion,

01:32:48.834 --> 01:32:51.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I can make that guarantee.”

01:32:51.253 --> 01:32:53.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as it turned out,
she was Catholic,

01:32:53.797 --> 01:32:57.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she definitely was unable
to make that guarantee.

01:32:57.884 --> 01:33:01.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s remember
these three powerful lessons

01:33:01.721 --> 01:33:03.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have discussed.

01:33:03.723 --> 01:33:07.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we’d like to say
to you dear interested ones in attendance,

01:33:07.727 --> 01:33:10.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you’re not yet one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:33:10.522 --> 01:33:13.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
we warmly invite you to please

01:33:13.692 --> 01:33:16.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
study the Bible with us.

01:33:16.361 --> 01:33:21.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
See for yourself how genuine love 
is the best way of life

01:33:21.366 --> 01:33:24.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is the best way to deal with the problems

01:33:24.619 --> 01:33:27.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
that divide society today.

01:33:27.372 --> 01:33:29.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus made it crystal clear

01:33:29.708 --> 01:33:34.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the identifying mark
of true Christians is love.

01:33:34.671 --> 01:33:37.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 13:35, he said:

01:33:37.757 --> 01:33:42.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By this all will know
that you are my disciples

01:33:42.387 --> 01:33:46.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if you have love among yourselves.”

01:33:46.057 --> 01:33:48.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So dear interested ones,

01:33:48.393 --> 01:33:51.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
see for yourself whether this genuine love

01:33:51.313 --> 01:33:54.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
exists among Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:33:55.192 --> 01:33:59.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we say to those of you
who are already Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:33:59.779 --> 01:34:02.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
please continue to cultivate and show

01:34:02.157 --> 01:34:06.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“love for the whole association of brothers.”

01:34:06.995 --> 01:34:11.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing so will require
that you remain strictly neutral

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:16.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the world’s political affairs
and other controversies,

01:34:16.505 --> 01:34:19.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as our Leader remained neutral.

01:34:19.591 --> 01:34:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 17:14,
Jesus said of his disciples:

01:34:24.387 --> 01:34:27.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are no part of the world,

01:34:27.015 --> 01:34:31.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as I am no part of the world.”

01:34:31.186 --> 01:34:35.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
So during discussions in the ministry
or anywhere for that matter,

01:34:35.398 --> 01:34:38.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
remain strictly neutral

01:34:38.443 --> 01:34:41.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
on political topics.

01:34:41.196 --> 01:34:45.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take no position regarding what laws 
should be enacted,

01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:48.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
repealed, or changed.

01:34:48.078 --> 01:34:52.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t pressure others
to agree with your view.

01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:54.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to succeed in this,

01:34:54.501 --> 01:34:57.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be careful not to allow
the media of this world

01:34:57.879 --> 01:35:00.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
to manipulate our thinking.

01:35:00.298 --> 01:35:02.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
News broadcasts are often presented

01:35:02.968 --> 01:35:06.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a biased, opinionated way.

01:35:06.054 --> 01:35:09.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ve got to be careful
not to adopt the bias of a commentator.

01:35:09.391 --> 01:35:12.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only if we keep our thinking neutral

01:35:12.769 --> 01:35:17.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
will we be able to keep
our speech and actions neutral also.

01:35:17.274 --> 01:35:22.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, your good example
of showing love in Christian neutrality

01:35:22.279 --> 01:35:26.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
may attract honest-hearted ones to the truth.

01:35:27.534 --> 01:35:29.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:33.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned from this symposium?

01:35:33.331 --> 01:35:37.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s highlight just one
valuable takeaway lesson

01:35:37.252 --> 01:35:39.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
from each of our six parts.

01:35:39.546 --> 01:35:42.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first part,
“Joseph and His Brothers”:

01:35:42.966 --> 01:35:46.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our lesson is sow peace

01:35:46.511 --> 01:35:50.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
by letting go of resentment.

01:35:50.015 --> 01:35:52.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second part,
“The Gibeonites”:

01:35:52.809 --> 01:35:55.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly submit to Jehovah’s will,

01:35:55.895 --> 01:36:00.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it differs from what you prefer.

01:36:00.066 --> 01:36:02.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third part,
“Gideon”:

01:36:02.319 --> 01:36:05.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prevent conflicts from escalating

01:36:05.322 --> 01:36:08.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
by choosing words that calm,

01:36:08.158 --> 01:36:11.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
reassure, and heal.

01:36:11.536 --> 01:36:13.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fourth part,
“Abigail”:

01:36:13.955 --> 01:36:16.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do what you can to promote peace,

01:36:16.583 --> 01:36:20.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then leave matters with Jehovah.

01:36:20.337 --> 01:36:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fifth part,
“Mephibosheth”:

01:36:22.631 --> 01:36:25.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be willing to suffer loss

01:36:25.091 --> 01:36:28.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than disturb the peace
in the congregation.

01:36:28.762 --> 01:36:31.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just another thought on this:
Let’s always remember

01:36:31.556 --> 01:36:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
that defending Jehovah’s name and reputation

01:36:34.517 --> 01:36:36.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
is far more important

01:36:36.853 --> 01:36:40.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
than trying to defend
our own name and reputation.

01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:42.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be willing to suffer loss

01:36:42.275 --> 01:36:46.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than disturb the peace
in the congregation.

01:36:46.154 --> 01:36:49.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sixth part (this part),
“Modern-Day Examples”:

01:36:49.324 --> 01:36:53.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serve the God of peace with his people,

01:36:53.453 --> 01:36:56.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have peace.

01:36:56.539 --> 01:36:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, during this symposium,

01:36:58.708 --> 01:37:03.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve learned many valuable lessons
as to how we can sow peace.

01:37:03.004 --> 01:37:06.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s all be determined to do so
with all our heart.

01:37:06.383 --> 01:37:08.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what will be the final result?

01:37:08.927 --> 01:37:10.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the answer,

01:37:10.762 --> 01:37:15.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s watch the final dramatization
of this symposium.

01:37:20.772 --> 01:37:22.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one more story to tell.

01:37:24.234 --> 01:37:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know it at the time,

01:37:26.903 --> 01:37:29.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
but seeds of truth

01:37:29.698 --> 01:37:31.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
were being planted in my heart.

01:37:37.539 --> 01:37:39.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were all so different.

01:37:39.582 --> 01:37:42.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand it.

01:37:46.756 --> 01:37:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were prisoners, yes,

01:37:49.592 --> 01:37:51.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you felt free

01:37:56.474 --> 01:37:58.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
—truly free.

01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:04.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
After you were released,

01:38:06.401 --> 01:38:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
it became clear to me

01:38:08.778 --> 01:38:11.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have God’s blessing,

01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:14.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted to know why.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil helped me find the answer.

01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:24.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you will know the truth,

01:38:24.377 --> 01:38:27.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truth will set you free.”

01:38:29.632 --> 01:38:32.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil encouraged me to make the truth my own.

01:38:33.553 --> 01:38:37.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had real trouble at first.

01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:40.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
With all the turmoil going on at the time,

01:38:40.143 --> 01:38:43.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea of being peaceable

01:38:43.188 --> 01:38:46.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waiting on God’s Kingdom

01:38:48.318 --> 01:38:50.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was hard to grasp.

01:38:57.202 --> 01:38:59.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s help

01:39:01.414 --> 01:39:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the patience of these good people,

01:39:05.835 --> 01:39:09.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized
before the start of the great tribulation.

01:39:18.848 --> 01:39:21.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph, during our time in prison,

01:39:21.935 --> 01:39:23.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
the story of your life

01:39:23.978 --> 01:39:26.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
—your time in prison

01:39:26.481 --> 01:39:27.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah was always with you—

01:39:27.816 --> 01:39:29.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
became a real source of strength

01:39:29.776 --> 01:39:31.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us.

01:39:31.486 --> 01:39:33.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one day,

01:39:34.155 --> 01:39:36.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Carl said—

01:39:36.658 --> 01:39:38.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you say?

01:39:38.284 --> 01:39:42.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “One day,
we’ll have a meal with Joseph,

01:39:42.872 --> 01:39:46.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll say ‘thank you.’”

01:39:46.125 --> 01:39:48.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we are!

01:39:48.336 --> 01:39:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, it’s I who should thank you.

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each and every one
of your stories

01:39:55.468 --> 01:39:57.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
touches my heart.

01:39:57.554 --> 01:39:59.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know a lot about my life,

01:39:59.639 --> 01:40:03.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
but would it be all right
if I shared a few more stories?

01:40:03.226 --> 01:40:04.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please!

01:40:04.227 --> 01:40:05.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have so many questions.

01:40:05.728 --> 01:40:07.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about Egypt?

01:40:07.105 --> 01:40:08.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Pharaoh really like?

01:40:08.314 --> 01:40:09.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dreams!

01:40:09.274 --> 01:40:11.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to talk about those dreams.

01:40:13.152 --> 01:40:16.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
You do have many questions!

01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:19.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have many details to share.

01:40:19.826 --> 01:40:22.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thanks to our God, Jehovah,

01:40:22.036 --> 01:40:25.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have all the time we need.

01:40:34.132 --> 01:40:36.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a touching video!

01:40:36.676 --> 01:40:39.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we wholeheartedly sow peace,

01:40:39.637 --> 01:40:44.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll ‘save ourselves
and those who listen to us.’

01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:47.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what fundamental truth from our great God

01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:50.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
have we discussed during this symposium?

01:40:50.815 --> 01:40:55.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s expressed at Galatians 6:7:

01:40:55.778 --> 01:40:58.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For whatever a person is sowing,

01:40:58.573 --> 01:41:01.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
this he will also reap.”

01:41:01.826 --> 01:41:04.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we sow a tomato seed,

01:41:04.662 --> 01:41:07.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will always get tomato plants.

01:41:07.332 --> 01:41:11.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this unfailing fundamental truth
applies to peace.

01:41:11.085 --> 01:41:15.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we sow peace,
we will always reap peace.

01:41:15.465 --> 01:41:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although in some cases,

01:41:17.467 --> 01:41:22.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may take some time
for the peace we sowed to bring good results.

01:41:22.263 --> 01:41:25.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we persevere in sowing peace,

01:41:25.058 --> 01:41:28.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will reap peace of mind,

01:41:28.102 --> 01:41:32.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace with others and, most important,
peace with Jehovah.

01:41:32.273 --> 01:41:36.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll reap the reward
of living forever in a world

01:41:36.277 --> 01:41:40.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there will be an abundance of peace.

01:41:40.531 --> 01:41:44.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s be determined to sow peace now

01:41:44.243 --> 01:41:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can reap peace forever.

01:41:46.955 --> 01:41:48.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,

01:41:48.581 --> 01:41:52.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s a pretty good investment
of our time and effort, isn’t it?

01:41:52.585 --> 01:41:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sow peace now

01:41:55.004 --> 01:41:58.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reap peace forever.

01:42:00.843 --> 01:42:03.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for those practical talks.

01:42:03.805 --> 01:42:06.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all remember these useful examples

01:42:06.516 --> 01:42:11.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sow peace now
so that we can reap peace eternally.

01:42:12.647 --> 01:42:16.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s sing together song number 28,

01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:18.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gaining Jehovah’s Friendship.”

01:42:18.861 --> 01:42:21.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 28.

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the next challenge we’ll discuss?

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:08.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a disagreement between elders.

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:11.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re an elder,
have you experienced that?

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were voices raised?

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:15.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did tempers flare?

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:20.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has a friendship
with a fellow elder cooled off?

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:23.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though we rightly expect
appointed brothers to be exemplary,

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:27.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fact is that all of us, including elders,

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:29.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
are still imperfect.

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:33.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Differences in backgrounds,
personalities, experiences, and opinions

00:00:33.932 --> 00:00:36.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to disagreements.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:38.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a disagreement, if not resolved,

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
can disrupt our peace and that of others.

00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:45.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this talk, we’ll consider
how two elders in the first century,

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:49.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul and Barnabas, sowed and reaped peace.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how their example
can help appointed men today,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
including all of you dear elders,
to resolve a disagreement.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible with me
to Acts chapter 15

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and read together verses 36 to 39.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the reading, please note the problem
that arose between Paul and Barnabas.

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:14.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Acts chapter 15,
beginning in verse 36:

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:19.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After some days, Paul said to Barnabas:

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:23.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let us now return and visit the brothers
in every one of the cities

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:27.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where we proclaimed the word of Jehovah,
to see how they are.’

00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:32.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Barnabas was determined
to take along John, who was called Mark.

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:37.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul, however, was not in favor
of taking him along with them,

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seeing that he had departed
from them in Pamphylia

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:43.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and had not gone with them to the work.

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:48.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this there was a sharp burst of anger,

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they separated from each other;

00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:55.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Barnabas took Mark along
and sailed away to Cyprus.”

00:01:55.813 --> 00:01:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the problem?

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
These two elders strongly disagreed

00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:05.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
about whether to take Mark with them
on their next missionary tour.

00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:09.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, expressing
a difference of opinion is not always wrong.

00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:13.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 7 of this same chapter
reports that the apostles

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and older men in Jerusalem
had an “intense discussion”

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:19.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to a good outcome.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in this case, what resulted?

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please look again at verse 39.

00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:27.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be nice to read,

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:30.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this Paul and Barnabas prayed to Jehovah

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and came to an agreement.”

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:36.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, though,
their discussion on this occasion

00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:39.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
led to a “sharp burst of anger,

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:42.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they separated.”

00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:46.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, their friendship
was affected by a temporary strain.

00:02:47.827 --> 00:02:50.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say “temporary”?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in time, 
it appears that Paul and Barnabas

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
put this matter behind them.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
A short time later
in Paul’s letter to the Galatians,

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:04.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wrote about Barnabas
and the activity they had enjoyed together.

00:03:04.637 --> 00:03:08.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul did not bring up their dispute.

00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:13.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, when Paul later wrote
to the Colossians and then to Timothy,

00:03:13.063 --> 00:03:16.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul spoke well of Mark.

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:20.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in Paul’s last inspired letter,
the second to Timothy, he wrote this:

00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:25.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Bring Mark along with you,
for he is helpful to me in the ministry.”

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it seems that Paul and Barnabas

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
resolved their disagreement.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:34.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s think about that, brothers.

00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:36.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
What made that possible?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s this: Long before their disagreement,

00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:44.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had shared together
in an exciting ministry.

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:46.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
For years, they were united

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what the Bible calls a “bond of peace.”

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though their friendship
experienced strain,

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:56.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
the bond between them was strong

00:03:56.485 --> 00:03:59.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
—strong enough to withstand the stress.

00:04:00.781 --> 00:04:03.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s bring this to our day.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
please notice how an elder sows peace.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know, there is more to the story.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil didn’t know just

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never talked,

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:31.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean really talked, about it

00:04:31.565 --> 00:04:34.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it was too late.

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:48.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to talk.

00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:55.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we need to seriously reconsider
Phil’s qualifications.

00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:57.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know he’s not
the type of brother that . . .

00:04:57.384 --> 00:05:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enough. Enough!
Enough about Phil.

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know he’s your friend, . . .

00:05:01.764 --> 00:05:02.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friend?

00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . but the body agreed that he
no longer qualified to serve as an elder.

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:06.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friend?
Friend?

00:05:06.102 --> 00:05:08.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s worked with us for years!

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The body decided, unanimously,

00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he should no longer serve.

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:15.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you pushed them!

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:18.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s enough that we have
those outside the congregation

00:05:21.494 --> 00:05:23.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting pressure on us;
we do not need more in here!

00:05:23.162 --> 00:05:24.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think . . .

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:30.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conversation
—the argument—

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was terrible.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both said things we didn’t mean.

00:05:36.594 --> 00:05:39.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after that,
we both handled the situation poorly.

00:05:57.324 --> 00:05:59.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
We needed to make things right.

00:06:18.723 --> 00:06:20.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we talked it out.

00:06:25.772 --> 00:06:29.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we made peace with Jehovah’s help.

00:06:32.988 --> 00:06:36.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what it would have been like
in that cellblock if we hadn’t?

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
We finally told Phil the whole story
once we were all roommates.

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:44.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:06:46.086 --> 00:06:47.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re ready!

00:06:47.838 --> 00:06:49.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go sing.

00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:53.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an island of calm
In dark stormy seas,

00:06:53.844 --> 00:06:59.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people are living in peace.

00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:06.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our eyes of faith,
We see beyond the clouds

00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:12.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that the storm soon will cease.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:18.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:23.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:07:23.084 --> 00:07:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below . . .

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:33.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, here’s the question
before all of us now:

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Paul and Barnabas?

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:41.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, as elders,
we must apply Scriptural counsel

00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:44.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our dealings with one another.

00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:49.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, we just saw how imperfection
got the better of Tim and Carl

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their body language,
choice of words, tone of voice.

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:57.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Tim put it,
‘The argument was terrible.’

00:07:57.788 --> 00:08:00.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the dispute,

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:04.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did those two elders
eventually do right?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
They applied Scriptural counsel
and made peace.

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:12.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the divine counsel at James 3:17

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:16.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds all of us
to be “peaceable [and] reasonable.” 

00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:20.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> once suggested
how this could be applied to elders.

00:08:20.772 --> 00:08:25.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
I quote: “Peacemakers
modestly express their thoughts

00:08:25.694 --> 00:08:29.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and then respectfully listen
to those of others.

00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:31.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Instead of insisting on his own way,

00:08:31.366 --> 00:08:35.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a peacemaker will prayerfully consider
his brother’s viewpoint.

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:38.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If no Bible principle is violated,

00:08:38.165 --> 00:08:41.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there is usually room
for varied points of view. 

00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:46.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Experienced overseers
know that preserving the peace

00:08:46.424 --> 00:08:50.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more important
than getting one’s own way.”

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful thought!

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s our first lesson?

00:08:55.184 --> 00:08:58.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we as elders apply Scriptural counsel

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:00.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our dealings with one another,

00:09:00.648 --> 00:09:05.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll never allow a difference of opinion
to become a cause for animosity.

00:09:06.822 --> 00:09:11.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 12:10 outlines a second lesson.

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible with me there.

00:09:13.746 --> 00:09:18.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under inspiration, at Romans 12:10,

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:20.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote this:

00:09:20.044 --> 00:09:22.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In brotherly love

00:09:22.464 --> 00:09:26.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have tender affection for one another.

00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:31.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:35.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers (elders), now,
before life gets even more difficult,

00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:38.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is what we need to do.

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:43.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to strengthen
love and affection for one another.

00:09:43.027 --> 00:09:46.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do that by continuing to speak well

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our fellow elders
in public and in private,

00:09:49.827 --> 00:09:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
by resisting the urge to talk negatively
to other elders

00:09:53.455 --> 00:09:56.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
about any disagreements that arise,

00:09:56.042 --> 00:10:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by regularly reflecting
on our brothers’ good qualities

00:10:00.797 --> 00:10:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on our past service together.

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:08.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, weren’t we happy
to see how Tim and Carl

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
imitated Paul and Barnabas
and eventually reaped peace?

00:10:12.643 --> 00:10:16.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though not easy,
they applied Scriptural counsel

00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:18.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resolved their problem.

00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:23.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
That warm smile on Carl’s face
when he showed up at Tim’s home,

00:10:23.697 --> 00:10:27.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dessert (perhaps Tim’s favorite pie),

00:10:27.618 --> 00:10:30.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
the heart-to-heart talk,

00:10:30.204 --> 00:10:34.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their lasting friendship, even in prison,

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed that they maintained
their love and affection for each other.

00:10:40.632 --> 00:10:45.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers, elders, may we do likewise.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s settle disagreements
quickly and peacefully.

00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:53.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do so, we’ll reap not only peace,

00:10:53.229 --> 00:10:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’ll prove to be examples to the flock,

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Paul and Barnabas.

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:02.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Stephen Lett,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:11:02.697 --> 00:11:06.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:11:06.284 --> 00:11:11.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Modern-Day Examples.”

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is an ongoing need
for volunteers at Bethel

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on theocratic construction projects.

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has limited

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of those who may be invited
at this time,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is still a need for volunteers.

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
please note the spirit displayed

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:49.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
by those who make themselves available
for Bethel service.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making yourself available for Bethel service

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like knocking on a door that leads

00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
to many other privileges of service.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, to serve at Bethel

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires a self-sacrificing spirit

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a willingness to serve
wherever there is a need,

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with the attitude 
displayed by the prophet Isaiah

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 6:8:

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying:

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said: ‘Here I am! Send me!’”

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:29.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Isaiah learned about an opportunity

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do more in Jehovah’s service,
he responded eagerly,

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though he did not know exactly
what he was going to be assigned to do.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was enough for him to know
that Jehovah was extending an invitation

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:43.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve in a special way,

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same spirit is shown
by Bethel family members worldwide.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the Branch Committee determines
that there is a need for your services,

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:00.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will decide where you can best be used,

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether at Bethel or perhaps
on a theocratic construction assignment.

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Submitting your application
may open a door of opportunity

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve Jehovah and his organization
in a variety of ways.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was an excerpt from the video

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Making Yourself Available for Bethel Service.</i>

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are interested in serving at Bethel

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
or on theocratic construction projects

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a part-time or full-time basis,

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
please watch the entire video on jw.org.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baptized Christians who are
19 years of age or older

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are interested in volunteering
should apply.

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:50.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speak to your congregation secretary
for more information.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
If possible, please submit
your application electronically

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org.

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever found yourself in a situation
where your peace was threatened?

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you handle it?

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can learn much
from the faithful man Jacob

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:12.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to make peace.

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:16.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Genesis chapter 26,

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and follow along as Brother Mark Sanderson,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
applies the lessons

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:26.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the dramatic Bible reading
with the theme

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“</i>Jacob—A Man Who Loved Peace.<i>”</i>

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:43.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever been
the victim of oppression or injustice?

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:45.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
Have you been angered by something

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.664 line:10% position:50% align:center
someone has said or done?

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us hasn’t?

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
In situations like that,

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:53.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who don’t know Jehovah

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
often react in a way
that’s far from peaceful.

00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
They retaliate; they fight;

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
they hit back.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know that Jehovah
sees what happened,

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he can set matters straight.

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:13.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re wise to remember the words of Jesus:

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the mild-tempered.”

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the peacemakers.”

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible describes a man
who remained mild and peaceable

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some extremely difficult
and stressful situations.

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Repeatedly, he chose not to fight,

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
preferring a course that led to peace.

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:40.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
That man was Jacob.

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:43.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob learned from the peaceful example

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his father, Isaac.

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a famine in the land,

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Isaac moved his family to Gerar,

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:57.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was ruled by Abimelech,
king of the Philistines.

00:04:57.276 --> 00:05:00.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about the problems that arose

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Isaac dealt with them.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:07.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Genesis 26:12.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:13.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Isaac began to sow seed in that land,

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:18.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in that year he reaped
100 times what he sowed,

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:21.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah was blessing him.

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The man became wealthy,

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:28.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he continued to prosper
until he became very wealthy.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:32.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He acquired flocks of sheep
and herds of cattle

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a large body of servants,

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Philistines began to envy him.

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:42.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the Philistines took soil

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:46.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and stopped up all the wells
that his father’s servants had dug

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the days of Abraham.

00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:51.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abimelech then said to Isaac:

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:56.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Move from our neighborhood,
for you have grown far stronger than we are.’

00:05:56.585 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Isaac moved from there
and encamped in the valley of Gerar

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and began dwelling there.

00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Isaac again dug the wells

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:10.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had been dug
in the days of his father Abraham

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that the Philistines had stopped up
after Abraham’s death,

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:20.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he called them by the names
that his father had given them.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:24.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the servants of Isaac
were digging in the valley,

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they found a well of fresh water.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:28.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the shepherds of Gerar

00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:33.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“began quarreling
with the shepherds of Isaac, saying:

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:35.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The water is ours!’

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he named the well Esek,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they had quarreled with him.

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they started digging another well,

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:47.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they began quarreling over it also.

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:50.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he named it Sitnah.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:54.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Later he moved away from there
and dug another well,

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they did not quarrel over it.

00:06:57.312 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he named it Rehoboth and said:

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:05.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is because now Jehovah
has given us ample room

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:08.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and has made us fruitful in the land.’

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he went up from there to Beersheba.

00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:16.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That night Jehovah appeared to him and said:

00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am the God of your father Abraham.

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:23.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not be afraid, for I am with you,

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:26.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and I will bless you
and multiply your offspring

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:29.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
on account of Abraham my servant.’”

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:34.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Philistines, motivated by envy,

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:38.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
stop up all the wells that Abraham had dug,

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:42.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the king asks Isaac
to move from the neighborhood.

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:46.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac now has a decision to make.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps some encourage him to stay put.

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:52.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how they might have reasoned:

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:55.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’ve done nothing wrong, Isaac.

00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:58.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah told you that you and your offspring

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:00.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘would possess the land.

00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:03.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You have nothing to fear.

00:08:03.378 --> 00:08:05.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You have many servants,

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:08.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and they’re stronger than the Philistines.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why not hit back

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:14.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
against those who have done this
to your wells?’

00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:18.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this situation, what would you have done?

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac chooses a peaceful course.

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
He decides to move on.

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:29.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not easy.

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:32.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac has many servants

00:08:32.032 --> 00:08:36.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:39.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has tilled the ground and planted seed,

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:42.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s produced plentifully,

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:47.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he leaves that behind and moves on.

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:52.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Isaac’s troubles are not over.

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his new location, his servants dig wells

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find fresh water.

00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:01.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the shepherds in that area say:

00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The water is ours!”

00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:07.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac then digs another well,

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:11.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the local shepherds
quarrel about that one too.

00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:15.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, instead of fighting over the matter,

00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:19.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac moves and finally finds a place

00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:23.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he can reside in peace.

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:28.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob saw that his father’s peaceful actions

00:09:28.213 --> 00:09:30.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a good effect,

00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:34.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knew that Isaac
had received Jehovah’s blessing.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:38.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, never underestimate
the powerful effect

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:47.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
your good example can have on your children.

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:52.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob has a twin brother, Esau.

00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:56.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of the two, Esau is born first,

00:09:56.366 --> 00:10:00.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah foretells
that—contrary to custom—

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:04.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
the older Esau will serve
his younger brother.

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:10.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah foresees
what kind of personalities they’ll develop,

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:14.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knows that Esau
will have little appreciation

00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:16.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritual matters.

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
This becomes evident

00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:22.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Esau exchanges his right as firstborn

00:10:22.976 --> 00:10:26.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a mere bowl of stew,

00:10:26.313 --> 00:10:29.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
sealing the matter with an oath.

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:32.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
But something more is involved.

00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:37.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
In selling the birthright,
he also gives up the right

00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:42.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive a prophetic blessing
from his father.

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:47.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years pass, Isaac has grown old,

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:49.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he decides it’s time to impart

00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:52.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
the blessing to his firstborn.

00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may not know
that Esau had sold his right as firstborn.

00:10:57.886 --> 00:11:02.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any case, he tells Esau
that he will bless him

00:11:02.766 --> 00:11:04.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
but asks him first

00:11:04.768 --> 00:11:08.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide him with a tasty dish

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:10.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
of fresh game from the field.

00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:16.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah, the twins’ mother,
overhears this conversation

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:21.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persuades Jacob
to impersonate his twin brother

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:24.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
while Esau is out hunting.

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:27.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
The plan is successful.

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:31.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac unwittingly blesses Jacob!

00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:35.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esau, at learning of this, is furious.

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:37.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take up the account

00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:41.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Genesis 27:41.

00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:47.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Esau harbored
animosity against Jacob

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:51.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of the blessing
his father had given him,

00:11:51.273 --> 00:11:54.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Esau kept saying in his heart:

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:59.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The days of mourning for my father
are getting closer.

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:03.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that I am going to kill
Jacob my brother.’

00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:08.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the words of her older son Esau
were told to Rebekah,

00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:11.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“she at once sent for her younger son Jacob

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:14.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to him: ‘Look!

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:19.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Your brother Esau is planning
to take revenge by killing you.

00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:21.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now, my son, do as I say.

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:25.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Get up and run away
to my brother Laban at Haran.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Dwell with him for a while

00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:31.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘until your brother’s rage calms down,

00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:35.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘until your brother’s anger
toward you subsides

00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:38.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and he forgets what you have done to him.

00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:41.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Then I will send for you from there.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why should I lose both of you in one day?’

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:50.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that Rebekah kept saying to Isaac:

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:55.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am disgusted with my life
because of the daughters of Heth.

00:12:55.337 --> 00:12:58.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If Jacob ever takes a wife
from the daughters of Heth,

00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:00.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘like these daughters of the land,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what good is my life?’

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Isaac called Jacob

00:13:05.597 --> 00:13:09.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and blessed him and commanded him, saying:

00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:13.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must not take a wife
from the daughters of Canaan.

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:15.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go away to Paddanaram

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to the house of Bethuel,
your mother’s father,

00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:21.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and from there take for yourself a wife

00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:24.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘from the daughters of Laban,
your mother’s brother.

00:13:24.783 --> 00:13:29.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God Almighty will bless you
and make you fruitful and multiply you,

00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:33.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will certainly become
a congregation of peoples.

00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:36.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And he will give to you
the blessing of Abraham,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to you and to your offspring with you,

00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that you may take possession of the land
where you have been living as a foreigner,

00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:47.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which God has given to Abraham.’

00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:50.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Isaac sent Jacob away,

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:52.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he departed for Paddanaram,

00:13:52.977 --> 00:13:56.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramaean,

00:13:56.481 --> 00:14:00.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother of Rebekah,
the mother of Jacob and Esau.”

00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:06.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob’s parents tell him to travel
to his uncle, Laban,

00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:08.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find a wife.

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:11.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the core issue

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:13.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the problem with Esau.

00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:18.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that earlier,
Isaac had a problem with the Philistines

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:23.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a problem that evidently
could not be settled peacefully.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did Isaac do?

00:14:26.636 --> 00:14:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
He moved on.

00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:33.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now Jacob faces a similar situation.

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:36.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
His brother is seething with anger,

00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Jacob leaves.

00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:43.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means leaving his home and his family;

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:48.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means making a long journey
to a distant land.

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:52.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob could have chosen to stand his ground.

00:14:52.787 --> 00:14:55.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
He owns the birthright.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could argue the matter
with his father and mother:

00:14:58.376 --> 00:15:02.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m no child. I’m 77 years old!’

00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:06.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob does none of those things.

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:08.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible simply says:

00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:12.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob obeyed his father and his mother

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:14.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and departed.”

00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:16.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:18.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face a situation

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:22.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can’t be settled peacefully,

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:27.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
we probably won’t need to flee for our lives
to a distant land.

00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:31.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes, however,
it is the course of wisdom

00:15:31.034 --> 00:15:35.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
to walk away from a situation.

00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:39.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 17:14 says:

00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:44.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beginning a fight
is like opening a floodgate;

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:48.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the quarrel breaks out,
take your leave.”

00:15:50.011 --> 00:15:53.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
While Jacob is on his way to his uncle,

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:56.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah appears to Jacob in a dream

00:15:56.684 --> 00:16:01.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assures him
of his support and protection.

00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:04.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
That does not mean

00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:07.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jacob’s troubles are over.

00:16:07.195 --> 00:16:11.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the journey’s end,
he moves in with his uncle’s household.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, a situation arises again

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows that Jacob

00:16:18.122 --> 00:16:21.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a man who loves peace.

00:16:21.543 --> 00:16:26.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about it from Genesis 29:16.

00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:31.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Laban had two daughters.

00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:33.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The name of the older was Leah,

00:16:33.847 --> 00:16:37.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the name of the younger, Rachel.

00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:40.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the eyes of Leah had no luster,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whereas Rachel had become

00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:46.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a very attractive and beautiful woman.

00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel,
so he said:

00:16:50.446 --> 00:16:53.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am willing to serve you seven years

00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for your younger daughter Rachel.’

00:16:55.743 --> 00:16:58.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this Laban said:

00:16:58.037 --> 00:17:03.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is better for me to give her to you
than to give her to another man.

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:05.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep dwelling with me.’

00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:08.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,

00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:13.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in his eyes
they were like just a few days

00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:15.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because of his love for her.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jacob said to Laban:

00:17:18.766 --> 00:17:22.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Give over my wife because my days are up,

00:17:22.395 --> 00:17:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let me have relations with her.’

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:28.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that Laban gathered
all the men of the place

00:17:28.693 --> 00:17:30.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and made a feast.

00:17:30.737 --> 00:17:35.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But during the evening,
he resorted to taking his daughter Leah

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:40.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bringing her to him
that he might have relations with her.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Laban also gave his female servant Zilpah

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to his daughter Leah as a servant.

00:17:47.295 --> 00:17:52.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah!

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he said to Laban:

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What have you done to me?

00:17:56.554 --> 00:17:59.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Was it not for Rachel that I served you?

00:17:59.182 --> 00:18:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why have you tricked me?’

00:18:01.684 --> 00:18:04.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this Laban said:

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is not our custom here to give
the younger woman before the firstborn.

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:11.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Celebrate the week of this woman.

00:18:11.861 --> 00:18:14.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘After that you will also be given
this other woman

00:18:14.614 --> 00:18:19.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in exchange for serving me
seven more years.’

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:23.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob did so
and celebrated the week of this woman,

00:18:23.247 --> 00:18:27.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after which he gave him
his daughter Rachel as a wife.

00:18:27.627 --> 00:18:31.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Besides, Laban gave
his female servant Bilhah

00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his daughter Rachel as her servant.”

00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:38.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob has reason to be upset.

00:18:38.805 --> 00:18:40.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had arranged with Laban

00:18:40.807 --> 00:18:44.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work seven years for Rachel.

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:47.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the seven years,

00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:49.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
a wedding feast is arranged.

00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the heavily-veiled woman
brought in to him

00:18:53.152 --> 00:18:55.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not Rachel;

00:18:55.196 --> 00:18:57.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s Leah!

00:18:57.448 --> 00:19:02.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how shocked Jacob must have been!

00:19:02.078 --> 00:19:04.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of admitting to his deceit,

00:19:04.914 --> 00:19:08.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban gives an excuse.

00:19:08.334 --> 00:19:11.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
What thoughts come to Jacob’s mind?

00:19:11.546 --> 00:19:16.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he consider that Jehovah
might be working out his promise

00:19:16.092 --> 00:19:18.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make Jacob’s offspring plentiful

00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:22.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the dust particles of the earth”?

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know.

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:29.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turns out,
Leah bears him six sons,

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:32.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Levi and Judah

00:19:32.483 --> 00:19:37.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
—family heads of the two
most honored tribes of Israel.

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:41.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
Jacob couldn’t have foreknown this.

00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:45.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Jacob the peacemaker

00:19:45.413 --> 00:19:47.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepts Leah

00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:51.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and goes along
with Laban’s outrageous request

00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:55.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he work an additional seven years
for Rachel.

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:19:59.594 --> 00:20:02.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s disappointing when others

00:20:02.138 --> 00:20:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t hold to their agreements.

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:09.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jacob, can we find it in our hearts

00:20:09.645 --> 00:20:14.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to forgive and find a way
to preserve peace with them?

00:20:16.444 --> 00:20:18.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob serves Laban

00:20:18.446 --> 00:20:21.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 14 years for his two wives,

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:25.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he works for Laban another 6 years

00:20:25.078 --> 00:20:27.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a flock of his own.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, at Jehovah’s direction,

00:20:31.084 --> 00:20:34.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gathers his family along with his animals

00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:39.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, without informing Laban,
he leaves for home.

00:20:40.343 --> 00:20:44.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Laban learns of this, he is furious!

00:20:44.347 --> 00:20:47.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chases and catches up with Jacob.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:51.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a dangerous situation,

00:20:51.145 --> 00:20:54.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that can easily turn violent.

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:58.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how it might have been:

00:20:58.194 --> 00:21:01.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob had come to a mountainous region.

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:06.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Possibly it’s morning, and the air is cool.

00:21:06.202 --> 00:21:09.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are the sounds and smells of animals

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:14.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
—sheep, donkeys, camels; there are many.

00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:16.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
The servants attend to them,

00:21:16.712 --> 00:21:20.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting them ready for the day’s journey.

00:21:20.383 --> 00:21:23.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then come cries of alarm.

00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:27.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban has come, and he’s not alone.

00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:29.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
He arrives with strong men.

00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:34.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gallop in on camels; they dismount.

00:21:34.063 --> 00:21:38.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not a friendly visit.

00:21:38.234 --> 00:21:42.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban’s men are ready
to obey orders from Laban.

00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:46.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob’s servants quickly gather to the scene.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
All eyes are fixed on Laban and Jacob,

00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
who argue.

00:21:52.623 --> 00:21:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
The previous night,
Jehovah had warned Laban in a dream

00:21:56.961 --> 00:22:01.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be careful about what he’d say to Jacob.

00:22:01.132 --> 00:22:05.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Laban is angry and aggressive.

00:22:07.054 --> 00:22:09.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban makes two charges.

00:22:09.682 --> 00:22:14.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he says:
“Why have you resorted to outwitting me

00:22:14.645 --> 00:22:18.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and carrying my daughters off like captives

00:22:18.232 --> 00:22:20.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“taken by the sword?

00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:22.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why did you run away secretly

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and outwit me and not tell me?”

00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:29.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer to that charge is obvious.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob replies:

00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:34.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was because I was afraid,

00:22:34.415 --> 00:22:36.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I said to myself,

00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:40.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You might take your daughters
away from me by force.’”

00:22:41.005 --> 00:22:44.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban also charges that Jacob has stolen

00:22:44.675 --> 00:22:47.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
his household gods.

00:22:47.178 --> 00:22:50.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rachel has indeed stolen the gods,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jacob knows nothing about this.

00:22:53.935 --> 00:22:58.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
A search is made,
but the idols are not found.

00:22:58.898 --> 00:23:01.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob then makes his defense.

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:03.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take up our reading

00:23:03.569 --> 00:23:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Genesis 31:36.

00:23:09.242 --> 00:23:12.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that Jacob became angry

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and began to criticize Laban.

00:23:15.331 --> 00:23:17.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob then said to Laban:

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:22.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What is my offense, and for what sin
are you hotly pursuing me?

00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:25.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now that you have searched
through all my goods,

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:28.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘what have you found
that belongs to your house?

00:23:28.928 --> 00:23:32.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put it here in front of my brothers
and your brothers,

00:23:32.223 --> 00:23:35.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and let them decide between the two of us.

00:23:35.893 --> 00:23:39.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘During these 20 years
that I have been with you,

00:23:39.188 --> 00:23:42.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘your sheep and your goats never miscarried,

00:23:42.525 --> 00:23:46.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and I never ate the rams of your flock.

00:23:46.112 --> 00:23:50.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I did not bring you any animal
torn by wild beasts.

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:53.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I would stand the loss of it myself.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Whether the animal was stolen by day
or was stolen by night,

00:23:57.748 --> 00:24:00.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you would demand compensation from me.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘By day the heat consumed me,
and the cold by night,

00:24:05.715 --> 00:24:08.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and sleep would flee from my eyes.

00:24:08.718 --> 00:24:13.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This makes 20 years for me in your house.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have served you 14 years
for your two daughters

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:19.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and 6 years for your flock,

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you kept changing my wages ten times.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If the God of my father, the God of Abraham

00:24:26.694 --> 00:24:28.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the One whom Isaac fears,

00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:31.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘had not been on my side,

00:24:31.782 --> 00:24:35.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you would now have sent me away
empty-handed.

00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:39.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God has seen my affliction
and the toil of my hands,

00:24:39.623 --> 00:24:42.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that is why he reproved you last night.’

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Laban answered Jacob:

00:24:45.379 --> 00:24:49.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The daughters are my daughters
and the children my children

00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:51.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the flock my flock,

00:24:51.927 --> 00:24:54.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and everything you are looking at

00:24:54.555 --> 00:24:58.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is mine and my daughters’.

00:24:58.476 --> 00:25:02.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What can I do today against these
or against their children

00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:04.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘whom they have borne?

00:25:04.815 --> 00:25:09.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now come, let us make a covenant,
you and I,

00:25:09.153 --> 00:25:12.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it will serve as a witness between us.’

00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:17.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Jacob took a stone
and set it up as a pillar.

00:25:17.161 --> 00:25:21.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jacob said to his brothers:
‘Pick up stones!’

00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:24.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they took stones and made a pile.

00:25:24.877 --> 00:25:29.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that they ate there
on the pile of stones.

00:25:29.757 --> 00:25:33.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Laban began calling it Jegarsahadutha,

00:25:33.511 --> 00:25:36.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but Jacob called it Galeed.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Laban then said:

00:25:38.432 --> 00:25:41.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This pile of stones is a witness

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“between me and you today.’

00:25:44.105 --> 00:25:47.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why he named it Galeed,
and the Watchtower,

00:25:47.858 --> 00:25:49.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for he said:

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let Jehovah keep watch between you and me

00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:56.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘when we are out of each other’s sight.

00:25:56.325 --> 00:25:58.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you mistreat my daughters

00:25:58.994 --> 00:26:02.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and if you start taking wives
in addition to my daughters,

00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:05.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘though there is no man with us,

00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:09.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remember that God will be a witness
between you and me.’

00:26:09.964 --> 00:26:13.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Laban went on to say to Jacob:

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:15.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Here is this pile of stones,

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and here is the pillar
that I have erected between you and me.

00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:23.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This pile of stones is a witness,

00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:26.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the pillar
is something that bears witness,

00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:30.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that I will not pass beyond this pile
of stones to bring harm to you

00:26:30.818 --> 00:26:34.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will not pass
beyond this pile of stones

00:26:34.238 --> 00:26:37.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and this pillar to bring harm to me.

00:26:37.241 --> 00:26:40.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let the God of Abraham
and the God of Nahor,

00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:45.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God of their father, judge between us.’

00:26:45.207 --> 00:26:47.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jacob swore by the One

00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:50.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whom his father Isaac fears.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that Jacob offered
a sacrifice in the mountain

00:26:55.426 --> 00:26:58.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and invited his brothers to eat bread.

00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:02.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they ate
and spent the night in the mountain.

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:06.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Laban got up early in the morning

00:27:06.103 --> 00:27:10.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and kissed his grandchildren
and his daughters and blessed them.

00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:14.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Laban departed and returned home.”

00:27:17.072 --> 00:27:21.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob had served Laban faithfully
for 20 years,

00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:26.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though Laban had defrauded
and exploited him.

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban doesn’t acknowledge that

00:27:28.584 --> 00:27:31.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, dishonestly claims

00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:33.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he is the rightful owner

00:27:33.297 --> 00:27:36.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all that Jacob has with him.

00:27:36.425 --> 00:27:41.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban then suggests
that they make a covenant of peace

00:27:41.013 --> 00:27:45.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
ensuring that neither family
will bring harm to the other.

00:27:46.352 --> 00:27:50.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban’s motive is not that he loves peace.

00:27:50.397 --> 00:27:54.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might have been to ensure
that Jacob will not return

00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:57.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the household gods after Laban’s death

00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:01.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deprive his sons of their inheritance.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any case, Jacob agrees;

00:28:04.995 --> 00:28:07.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone relaxes;

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s to be no violence.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a monument is set up
to memorialize the agreement.

00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:19.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the many years of oppression,

00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob agrees to a covenant of peace.

00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:27.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not harbor resentment
or seek revenge.

00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:32.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
That crisis is over for Jacob.

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:35.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now another one looms.

00:28:35.776 --> 00:28:39.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob sends messengers to his brother.

00:28:39.488 --> 00:28:42.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say that Jacob is returning

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he seeks Esau’s favor.

00:28:46.245 --> 00:28:51.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
The messengers return with the news
that Esau is on his way to meet him

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with him are 400 men.

00:28:54.712 --> 00:28:56.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my!

00:28:56.755 --> 00:28:59.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is Esau still angry?

00:28:59.717 --> 00:29:02.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understandably, Jacob is worried.

00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:06.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not want to fight with his brother.

00:29:06.557 --> 00:29:09.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us see how he handles the situation.

00:29:09.602 --> 00:29:14.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Genesis 32:13.

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:20.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he spent the night there.

00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:22.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he took some of his possessions

00:29:22.573 --> 00:29:25.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a gift for Esau his brother:

00:29:25.993 --> 00:29:30.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
“200 female goats, 20 male goats,

00:29:30.873 --> 00:29:34.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“200 female sheep, 20 rams,

00:29:34.627 --> 00:29:37.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“30 camels nursing their young,

00:29:37.838 --> 00:29:41.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“40 cows, 10 bulls,

00:29:41.175 --> 00:29:43.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“20 female donkeys

00:29:43.427 --> 00:29:47.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and 10 full-grown male donkeys.

00:29:47.264 --> 00:29:50.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He handed them over to his servants,

00:29:50.142 --> 00:29:52.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one drove after another,

00:29:52.394 --> 00:29:55.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he said to his servants:

00:29:55.022 --> 00:29:57.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Cross over ahead of me,

00:29:57.441 --> 00:30:02.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you are to set a space
between one drove and the next.’

00:30:02.237 --> 00:30:05.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He also commanded the first one:

00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:08.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘In case Esau my brother
should meet you and ask,

00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:12.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“To whom do you belong,
and where are you going,

00:30:12.164 --> 00:30:15.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and to whom do these ahead of you belong?”

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘then you should say,
“To your servant Jacob.

00:30:19.129 --> 00:30:22.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“It is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau,

00:30:22.716 --> 00:30:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and look! he himself is also behind us.”’

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:30.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he commanded also the second, the third,

00:30:30.182 --> 00:30:33.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all those following the droves:

00:30:33.394 --> 00:30:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘According to this word,

00:30:35.437 --> 00:30:38.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you are to speak to Esau when you meet him.

00:30:38.649 --> 00:30:41.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And you should also say,

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:45.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
““Here is your servant Jacob behind us.”’

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he said to himself:

00:30:47.533 --> 00:30:52.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If I appease him
by sending a gift ahead of me,

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:54.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘then afterward when I see him,

00:30:54.832 --> 00:30:58.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
he may give me a kindly reception.’”

00:30:59.795 --> 00:31:03.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob wants peaceful relations
with his brother.

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:08.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sends a generous gift
—hundreds of animals—

00:31:08.387 --> 00:31:10.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help make that possible.

00:31:10.848 --> 00:31:13.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Jacob weak-minded,

00:31:13.016 --> 00:31:16.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
too cowardly to stand up to his brother?

00:31:16.353 --> 00:31:17.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:31:17.938 --> 00:31:20.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, as the time neared
for the meeting with Esau,

00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:24.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob wrestles with an angel until dawn

00:31:24.278 --> 00:31:28.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive further assurance
of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:31:28.699 --> 00:31:33.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now see what happens
when the two brothers meet.

00:31:34.204 --> 00:31:38.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Genesis 33:1.

00:31:40.127 --> 00:31:43.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Jacob raised his eyes

00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:45.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and saw Esau coming,

00:31:45.716 --> 00:31:49.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and 400 men were with him.

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:53.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he divided the children
among Leah, Rachel,

00:31:53.098 --> 00:31:55.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the two female servants.

00:31:55.934 --> 00:32:00.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He put the female servants
and their children in front,

00:32:00.647 --> 00:32:03.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Leah and her children after them,

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Rachel and Joseph behind them.

00:32:06.904 --> 00:32:09.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he himself went ahead of them

00:32:09.823 --> 00:32:13.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bowed down to the earth seven times

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as he came near to his brother.

00:32:16.497 --> 00:32:19.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Esau ran to meet him,

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:22.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he embraced him and kissed him,

00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:26.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they burst into tears.

00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:30.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he raised his eyes
and saw the women and the children,

00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:33.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he said: ‘Who are these with you?’

00:32:33.597 --> 00:32:35.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To which he said:

00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:39.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The children with whom God
has favored your servant.’

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:44.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that the female servants
came forward with their children

00:32:44.483 --> 00:32:46.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bowed down,

00:32:46.485 --> 00:32:49.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Leah too came forward with her children,

00:32:49.738 --> 00:32:51.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they bowed down.

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:55.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Joseph came forward with Rachel,

00:32:55.202 --> 00:32:57.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they bowed down.

00:32:57.329 --> 00:32:59.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Esau said:

00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:03.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What is the purpose of all this camp
of travelers that I have met?’

00:33:03.335 --> 00:33:06.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He replied: ‘In order to find favor

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the eyes of my lord.’

00:33:08.715 --> 00:33:10.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Esau said:

00:33:10.801 --> 00:33:14.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have a great many possessions,
my brother.

00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:17.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep what is yours.’

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, Jacob said:

00:33:19.476 --> 00:33:22.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No, please.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If I have found favor in your eyes,

00:33:25.482 --> 00:33:28.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you must take my gift from my hand,

00:33:28.443 --> 00:33:33.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because I brought it
so that I could see your face.

00:33:33.282 --> 00:33:36.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And I have seen your face

00:33:36.618 --> 00:33:39.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘as though seeing God’s face,

00:33:39.037 --> 00:33:42.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in that you received me with pleasure.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Take, please,

00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:48.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the gift conveying my blessing
that was brought to you,

00:33:48.505 --> 00:33:51.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for God has favored me

00:33:51.383 --> 00:33:55.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I have everything I need.’

00:33:55.012 --> 00:33:59.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he continued to urge him,
so that he took it.”

00:34:02.102 --> 00:34:04.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a happy outcome!

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:07.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of an angry confrontation,

00:34:07.774 --> 00:34:10.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a joyful reunion.

00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:14.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two men shed tears; they embrace.

00:34:14.281 --> 00:34:18.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, Jacob is the peacemaker.

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he prove that?

00:34:21.204 --> 00:34:25.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
He prayed, and he acted in harmony
with his prayers.

00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:27.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sent gifts.

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:31.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed honor and respect to his brother,
calling him lord

00:34:31.673 --> 00:34:34.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bowing seven times.

00:34:34.801 --> 00:34:37.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:34:37.095 --> 00:34:39.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t this account well illustrate

00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:42.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
the extent to which we
should be willing to go

00:34:42.976 --> 00:34:47.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preserve peace
with our Christian brothers and sisters?

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:50.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learn so much

00:34:50.817 --> 00:34:53.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
about seeking peace from Jacob.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
When threatened by his brother
while living at home,

00:34:57.074 --> 00:34:59.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
he moved away.

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:03.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
When deceived by Laban
regarding Rachel and Leah,

00:35:03.163 --> 00:35:05.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
he yielded.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
When chased down and accused by Laban,

00:35:08.669 --> 00:35:12.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob agreed to a covenant of peace.

00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:16.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when confronting Esau, he offered a gift.

00:35:16.843 --> 00:35:18.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind,

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
in none of these situations

00:35:20.597 --> 00:35:23.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
was Jacob the one who needed to apologize.

00:35:23.892 --> 00:35:26.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, throughout his life,

00:35:26.436 --> 00:35:29.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob loved peace.

00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:32.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
He relied on Jehovah,

00:35:32.734 --> 00:35:35.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed him.

00:35:35.487 --> 00:35:38.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never forgot Jacob

00:35:38.156 --> 00:35:40.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he pursued peace

00:35:40.826 --> 00:35:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his dealings with others.

00:35:43.453 --> 00:35:45.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do the same

00:35:45.664 --> 00:35:50.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when we pursue peace
in the face of injustice,

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of persecution,

00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:57.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
in small issues as well as in big issues—

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will not forget us either.

00:36:00.178 --> 00:36:02.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will richly bless us

00:36:02.639 --> 00:36:04.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we love peace

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:08.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Jacob loved peace.

00:36:15.694 --> 00:36:17.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
How comforting it is

00:36:17.904 --> 00:36:21.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reflect on Jehovah’s love and support

00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:24.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those who make peace!

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:28.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible account is filled
with practical examples

00:36:28.498 --> 00:36:31.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
that each of us can imitate.

00:36:31.376 --> 00:36:35.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be pleased to know
that the dramatic Bible reading

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jacob—A Man Who Loved Peace”

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
is now available for download

00:36:41.053 --> 00:36:43.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the jw.org website

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the <i>JW Library® </i> app.

00:36:50.645 --> 00:36:53.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we maintain our God-given peace

00:36:53.607 --> 00:36:57.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite living in an ungodly world?

00:36:57.444 --> 00:36:59.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention

00:36:59.613 --> 00:37:03.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Brother David Schafer,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:37:03.992 --> 00:37:06.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he answers this question in the talk

00:37:06.912 --> 00:37:10.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Result of True Righteousness
Will Be Peace.”

00:37:19.216 --> 00:37:23.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, we considered
the expression at Philippians 4:7,

00:37:23.136 --> 00:37:27.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding,”

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, the tranquility and calmness

00:37:30.769 --> 00:37:34.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy because we have
a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:37:34.648 --> 00:37:37.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a remarkable blessing!

00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:40.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
But although we enjoy God-given peace,

00:37:40.612 --> 00:37:45.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
our life in this system of things
is not problem free, is it?

00:37:45.283 --> 00:37:48.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 34:19 acknowledges
as much when it says:

00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:52.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many are the hardships of the righteous one,

00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:56.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah rescues him from them all.”

00:37:58.046 --> 00:38:00.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience family opposition,

00:38:00.632 --> 00:38:03.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
persecution, war, natural disasters,

00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:05.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
or severe illnesses,

00:38:05.804 --> 00:38:10.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
but none of these hardships
can “separate us from God’s love.”

00:38:10.142 --> 00:38:12.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Neither death nor life nor angels 

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor governments
nor things now here nor things to come”

00:38:14.771 --> 00:38:19.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
—none of these things
can rob us of the peace Jehovah gives.

00:38:20.527 --> 00:38:25.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, there is something that can.

00:38:26.324 --> 00:38:31.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Isaiah 32:17.

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:33.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read this text,

00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:37.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice that it refers to peace as a result.

00:38:37.919 --> 00:38:41.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think of peace that way, as a result?

00:38:41.214 --> 00:38:45.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
If peace is a result, what causes it?

00:38:45.468 --> 00:38:49.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 32:17:

00:38:49.306 --> 00:38:51.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The result

00:38:51.516 --> 00:38:56.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of true righteousness will be peace, 

00:38:56.271 --> 00:39:00.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the fruitage of true righteousness

00:39:00.442 --> 00:39:04.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be lasting tranquility and security.”

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful expression,
“lasting tranquility and security”!

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, from what does it result?

00:39:15.207 --> 00:39:17.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
True righteousness.

00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:19.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if righteousness
no longer mattered to us?

00:39:19.628 --> 00:39:21.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if a person concluded:
‘It makes no difference

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘how I live or what sacrifices I make.

00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:25.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to suffer hardships either way.

00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:29.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I might as well do
whatever I please while I can’?

00:39:29.012 --> 00:39:32.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong with that thinking?

00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:36.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it show appreciation for peace

00:39:36.144 --> 00:39:38.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that Jehovah
has done to make it possible?

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace is a result.

00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:44.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And behind every result is a cause.

00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:49.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we want peace,
we have to pursue righteousness.

00:39:49.407 --> 00:39:53.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
An unrighteous person
cannot be at peace with God.

00:39:53.536 --> 00:39:58.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serious transgressions put a strain
on a person’s relationship with God.

00:39:58.083 --> 00:40:00.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall King David’s words found

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 38:3.

00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:07.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sensing Jehovah’s disapproval, he wrote:

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no peace

00:40:10.136 --> 00:40:14.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
within my bones because of my sin.”

00:40:14.641 --> 00:40:16.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inevitably, the unrighteous person

00:40:16.935 --> 00:40:21.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reap what he sows and lose his peace.

00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is righteousness,
and how do we pursue it?

00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:30.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Righteousness is what we have or what we show

00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:33.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we do what is right
according to Jehovah’s standards.

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:36.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those standards
are not just rules we follow

00:40:36.746 --> 00:40:40.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
but principles that guide the way
we deal with each other.

00:40:40.917 --> 00:40:43.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Universal Sovereign and Creator,

00:40:43.878 --> 00:40:46.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God determines what is righteous.

00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:48.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that what was represented

00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:51.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
by “the tree of the knowledge
of good and bad” in the garden of Eden?

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:54.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of Jehovah’s command
to abstain from its fruit,

00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:59.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
that tree represented God’s right
to determine for his creatures

00:40:59.144 --> 00:41:02.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is good and what is bad for them.

00:41:02.147 --> 00:41:05.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although Jehovah
has given humans free will,

00:41:05.442 --> 00:41:07.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right to choose,

00:41:07.485 --> 00:41:10.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has not granted humans
(not even perfect ones)

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:14.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right to set the standard
for what is righteous and what is not.

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:20.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice once again that Isaiah 32:17 says

00:41:20.665 --> 00:41:25.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the result
of true righteousness will be peace.”

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
It uses that term twice—“true righteousness.”

00:41:29.632 --> 00:41:33.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everything called righteousness
is true righteousness.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:37.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people view righteousness
as just a personal virtue

00:41:37.557 --> 00:41:40.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
achieved by following the rules.

00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:42.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 23:28,

00:41:42.187 --> 00:41:46.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that the Pharisees
appeared righteous on the outside,

00:41:46.274 --> 00:41:49.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
but inside they were lawless.

00:41:49.986 --> 00:41:53.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 7:16 talks about those

00:41:53.114 --> 00:41:57.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
who think their standards
are more righteous even than God’s.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at Romans 10:3,

00:41:59.454 --> 00:42:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul talked about people
who ‘seek to establish

00:42:02.499 --> 00:42:05.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
their own righteousness.’

00:42:05.543 --> 00:42:07.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
But false piety,

00:42:07.545 --> 00:42:10.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
over-righteousness, and self-righteousness

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not what Isaiah 32:17 is talking about.

00:42:15.845 --> 00:42:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, many argue for the acceptance

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:22.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
of conduct that Jehovah forbids.

00:42:22.018 --> 00:42:26.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may even find support
from a world already alienated from God.

00:42:27.857 --> 00:42:31.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
But wide acceptance in a growing community

00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:33.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not redefine righteousness.

00:42:33.738 --> 00:42:37.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of that is true righteousness.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Creator sets
the standard for what is right

00:42:40.286 --> 00:42:44.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not our feelings,
not the community at large.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while you’re here in Isaiah,

00:42:46.835 --> 00:42:49.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
please turn to chapter 48.

00:42:50.088 --> 00:42:53.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to be viewed as righteous,

00:42:53.425 --> 00:42:56.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to trust that Jehovah

00:42:56.886 --> 00:42:59.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
should set the standard of right and wrong.

00:42:59.097 --> 00:43:02.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, we must prove
by our speech and actions

00:43:02.267 --> 00:43:06.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we agree with Jehovah’s standards
and obey him.

00:43:06.271 --> 00:43:10.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that takes real courage
in a wicked world.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we do that, we enjoy the result.

00:43:13.778 --> 00:43:16.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says at Isaiah chapter 48,

00:43:16.656 --> 00:43:19.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 17, 18:

00:43:20.493 --> 00:43:25.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,

00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:28.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Holy One of Israel:

00:43:28.168 --> 00:43:31.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:43:31.212 --> 00:43:34.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself

00:43:34.382 --> 00:43:37.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[or as the footnote says, teaching you
“for your own good”],

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:42.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.

00:43:42.307 --> 00:43:46.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If only you would pay attention
to my commandments!

00:43:46.478 --> 00:43:51.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Then your peace
would become just like a river

00:43:51.316 --> 00:43:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your righteousness
like the waves of the sea.’”

00:43:57.155 --> 00:44:00.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paying attention to Jehovah’s commandments
results in two things.

00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:03.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, our peace

00:44:03.203 --> 00:44:06.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “become just like a river”

00:44:06.498 --> 00:44:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
—serene, abundant, ongoing.

00:44:10.126 --> 00:44:14.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, our righteousness
will be “like the waves of the sea.”

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember your last trip to the beach?

00:44:17.967 --> 00:44:20.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you stood there on the shore,

00:44:20.053 --> 00:44:22.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps on a high hill overlooking the ocean

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
watching the waves
roll in one after the other

00:44:26.226 --> 00:44:28.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as they have for thousands of years,

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
could you feel a sense of constancy?

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says that our course

00:44:34.192 --> 00:44:37.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
of doing what is right can be just like that.

00:44:37.445 --> 00:44:40.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will guide us
in the path of righteousness.

00:44:40.073 --> 00:44:43.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will bless us with unending peace.

00:44:43.159 --> 00:44:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the process, we learn through experience

00:44:47.997 --> 00:44:50.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah’s wise and loving ways

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly benefit us personally.

00:44:52.961 --> 00:44:55.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we refuse to do that,

00:44:55.213 --> 00:44:58.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn what agitation
and discord truly mean.

00:44:58.299 --> 00:45:00.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
As verse 22 says:

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:05.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘There is no peace,’ says Jehovah,
‘for the wicked.’”

00:45:06.724 --> 00:45:08.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a heavy-handed threat to manipulate

00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:11.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
human behavior
as if Jehovah needed to do that.

00:45:11.229 --> 00:45:15.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a fact, a truth, a timeless principle.

00:45:15.775 --> 00:45:17.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is love.”

00:45:17.777 --> 00:45:20.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
He teaches us for our own good.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the result if we pay attention is peace

00:45:25.243 --> 00:45:29.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 48:17, 18.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these verses assure us
that imperfect humans

00:45:32.917 --> 00:45:37.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly can have a righteous standing with God.

00:45:37.922 --> 00:45:40.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s explore that further.

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:43.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall the very first time

00:45:43.678 --> 00:45:47.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “righteous” is used in the Bible?

00:45:47.473 --> 00:45:50.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Genesis chapter 6.

00:45:50.643 --> 00:45:53.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you likely recognize this
as the account about Noah.

00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:57.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah lived in an extremely wicked world.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his lifetime, rebel angels
left their assignments in heaven,

00:46:00.612 --> 00:46:03.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
materialized, married human women,

00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:07.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fathered hybrid offspring
who became violent giants.

00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:12.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did all of that wickedness
and violence affect Jehovah?

00:46:12.915 --> 00:46:15.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to Genesis 6:6,

00:46:15.793 --> 00:46:18.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“his heart was saddened,”

00:46:18.588 --> 00:46:21.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a remarkable thing to contemplate,
isn’t it?

00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:23.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s feelings are affected

00:46:23.384 --> 00:46:27.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
by our decisions because he cares for us.

00:46:27.764 --> 00:46:31.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
That ancient world became so wicked

00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:34.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah decided it must be destroyed.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, right in the midst
of all this depravity,

00:46:37.982 --> 00:46:40.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah showed a different spirit.

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says at Genesis 6:8, 9:

00:46:47.158 --> 00:46:52.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:46:52.163 --> 00:46:55.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the history of Noah.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah was a righteous man.”

00:46:59.587 --> 00:47:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is.

00:47:00.797 --> 00:47:05.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why was he described as righteous?

00:47:05.176 --> 00:47:08.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He proved himself faultless

00:47:08.763 --> 00:47:11.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
among his contemporaries.”

00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:13.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Noah was not like the rebel angels

00:47:13.476 --> 00:47:16.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
or their offspring
or like degraded human society.

00:47:16.771 --> 00:47:20.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Noah walked with the true God.”

00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:25.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus the second time
we find the word “righteous”

00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:29.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
is at Genesis 7:1:

00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:32.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that, Jehovah said to Noah:

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go into the ark,
you and all your household,

00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:37.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because you are the one

00:47:37.792 --> 00:47:40.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have found to be righteous

00:47:40.878 --> 00:47:45.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
before me among this generation.’”

00:47:45.299 --> 00:47:47.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Noah’s righteousness,

00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:50.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
he and his family survived the Flood

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:54.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worship Jehovah on a cleansed earth.

00:47:54.225 --> 00:47:57.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after the waters subsided

00:47:57.061 --> 00:48:00.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the family emerged from the ark,

00:48:00.148 --> 00:48:02.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
they witnessed a splendid sight,

00:48:02.984 --> 00:48:05.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
one never before observed:

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
a serene, multicolored arch

00:48:08.823 --> 00:48:11.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the sky
—a rainbow—

00:48:11.617 --> 00:48:13.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reassuring indication

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
of peace with God,

00:48:16.664 --> 00:48:20.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace resulting from righteousness.

00:48:20.877 --> 00:48:23.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And where does the word “righteous”

00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:26.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
appear next in the Bible?

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the account about Abraham

00:48:28.092 --> 00:48:31.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
—notably in his famous conversation
with Jehovah

00:48:31.012 --> 00:48:33.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in Genesis chapter 18,

00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:35.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah promised Abraham
that if he found

00:48:35.683 --> 00:48:38.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
as few as ten righteous people
in the city of Sodom,

00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:40.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would not destroy that city.

00:48:41.522 --> 00:48:44.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what was it that distinguished Abraham

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
as righteous in that moral climate?

00:48:48.237 --> 00:48:51.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read Genesis chapters 12 through 22,

00:48:51.657 --> 00:48:54.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get the sense that Abraham

00:48:54.076 --> 00:48:56.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a man of great faith, unwavering faith.

00:48:56.788 --> 00:48:59.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was ready to do whatever
Jehovah asked of him.

00:48:59.957 --> 00:49:03.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, citing Genesis 15:6

00:49:03.544 --> 00:49:07.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other texts, James 2:23 says

00:49:07.632 --> 00:49:11.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

00:49:11.886 --> 00:49:14.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and it was counted to him

00:49:14.388 --> 00:49:17.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as righteousness,’

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:22.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he came to be called Jehovah’s friend

00:49:22.063 --> 00:49:24.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah’s friend,

00:49:24.899 --> 00:49:28.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“peace with God resulting

00:49:28.736 --> 00:49:30.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
from righteousness].”

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about God’s people today?

00:49:33.825 --> 00:49:37.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Isaiah chapter 60

00:49:37.662 --> 00:49:41.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah chapter 60.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:44.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah refers to Noah

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Abraham as “righteous.”

00:49:47.463 --> 00:49:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would he say about you and me?

00:49:50.967 --> 00:49:53.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what it says
toward the end of this chapter.

00:49:53.845 --> 00:49:56.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah chapter 60,

00:49:56.472 --> 00:50:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 21, 22:

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And all your people

00:50:05.356 --> 00:50:08.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be righteous;

00:50:08.317 --> 00:50:12.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they will possess the land forever.

00:50:12.196 --> 00:50:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are the sprout that I planted,

00:50:14.657 --> 00:50:17.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the work of my hands,
for me to be beautified.

00:50:17.952 --> 00:50:22.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The little one will become a thousand
and the small one a mighty nation.

00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:24.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I myself, Jehovah,

00:50:24.584 --> 00:50:27.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
will speed it up in its own time.”

00:50:28.546 --> 00:50:31.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, prospective members of the great crowd

00:50:31.883 --> 00:50:36.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been declared righteous
as friends of God as Abraham was.

00:50:36.888 --> 00:50:39.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jehovah’s eyes, they are, as it says

00:50:39.682 --> 00:50:44.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Revelation 7:9, “dressed in white robes.”

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, they’re serving
alongside God’s spirit-anointed ones

00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:50.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are declared righteous for life.

00:50:50.735 --> 00:50:54.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, [our] Repurchaser,

00:50:54.113 --> 00:50:57.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Holy One of Israel,” has bought us back

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
from bondage to sin and death

00:51:00.328 --> 00:51:04.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:51:04.165 --> 00:51:06.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus with faith

00:51:06.292 --> 00:51:09.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ,

00:51:09.295 --> 00:51:14.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfect people are considered righteous
in the sight of God.

00:51:14.258 --> 00:51:18.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in calling us righteous,
Jehovah God by means of Jesus

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
has done something for us
that we could not do

00:51:20.806 --> 00:51:22.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ourselves in our imperfect condition.

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:26.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does that mean that we can do no wrong?

00:51:27.313 --> 00:51:30.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it does not mean that.

00:51:31.567 --> 00:51:33.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to maintain our peace,

00:51:33.903 --> 00:51:38.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must cooperate with Jehovah.

00:51:38.616 --> 00:51:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Romans chapter 1.

00:51:42.912 --> 00:51:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, like Noah and Abraham,

00:51:45.957 --> 00:51:47.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
we live in a wicked and violent world

00:51:47.959 --> 00:51:50.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we are exposed
to a spirit of disobedience.

00:51:50.962 --> 00:51:53.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan wants us to become part of this world

00:51:53.798 --> 00:51:58.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
by adopting its unrighteous standards.

00:51:58.344 --> 00:52:01.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world, sexual immorality
is practiced without shame.

00:52:01.889 --> 00:52:04.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Homosexuals flaunt their conduct.

00:52:04.558 --> 00:52:06.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah tells us

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
that homosexual acts are unrighteous.

00:52:10.439 --> 00:52:14.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
God specifically warned the Israelites

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:17.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
against this and other forms of immorality.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leviticus 18:22 says

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
that homosexual acts are “detestable.”

00:52:26.622 --> 00:52:29.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah still find it so offensive?

00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:33.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what he inspired
for both Jews and non-Jews

00:52:33.587 --> 00:52:35.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Christian Greek Scriptures here

00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:39.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 1:26, 27:

00:52:41.387 --> 00:52:44.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why God gave them over

00:52:44.515 --> 00:52:48.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to disgraceful sexual passion,

00:52:48.269 --> 00:52:51.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for their females changed the natural use

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of themselves into one contrary to nature;

00:52:53.816 --> 00:52:57.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“likewise also the males left
the natural use of the female

00:52:57.903 --> 00:53:01.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and became violently inflamed
in their lust toward one another,

00:53:01.657 --> 00:53:05.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“males with males, working what is obscene

00:53:05.161 --> 00:53:08.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and receiving
in themselves the full penalty,

00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:11.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was due for their error.”

00:53:11.375 --> 00:53:15.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah has not changed.

00:53:15.129 --> 00:53:18.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Creator, homosexual acts

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:21.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
constitute disgraceful,

00:53:21.093 --> 00:53:23.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
obscene error.

00:53:24.597 --> 00:53:26.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some would disagree.

00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:28.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
As verse 28 points out,

00:53:28.809 --> 00:53:33.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
such ones do not consider it
worthwhile “to acknowledge God.”

00:53:33.314 --> 00:53:35.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with what result?

00:53:35.858 --> 00:53:40.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it says there,
“a disapproved mental state”

00:53:40.029 --> 00:53:42.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just the opposite of peace.

00:53:42.656 --> 00:53:47.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And merely approving
of unrighteous conduct displeases Jehovah.

00:53:47.328 --> 00:53:51.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how this is indicated in verse 32:

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although these know full well
the righteous decree of God

00:53:55.544 --> 00:53:59.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—that those practicing such things
are deserving of death—

00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:01.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they not only keep on doing them

00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:06.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also approve of those practicing them.”

00:54:07.181 --> 00:54:10.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, we do not hate individuals

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
who practice unrighteousness,
nor do we judge them.

00:54:13.521 --> 00:54:15.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the contrary,
we share the good news with them.

00:54:15.815 --> 00:54:19.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember that we were all born
with the same infirmities

00:54:19.151 --> 00:54:21.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have the same sinful tendencies.

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:26.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also have
the same inherent spiritual need.

00:54:26.117 --> 00:54:29.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus, we recognize that others
can have the same peace,

00:54:29.245 --> 00:54:32.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same privileges,
and the same prospects we enjoy

00:54:32.873 --> 00:54:37.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they pay attention to Jehovah.

00:54:37.002 --> 00:54:41.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 2:3, 4 says
that God’s “will is that all sorts of people

00:54:41.841 --> 00:54:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be saved
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people practicing
all manner of unrighteousness

00:54:47.805 --> 00:54:49.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
have accepted the truth.

00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:53.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is what some of you were,”
1 Corinthians 6:11 says.

00:54:53.936 --> 00:54:57.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we communicate impartially
with all our neighbors.

00:54:57.523 --> 00:55:00.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we hate unrighteous conduct,

00:55:00.192 --> 00:55:04.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we refuse to compromise Bible principles.

00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:06.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes moral issues

00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:09.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
become the center
of heated political debates.

00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:13.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
We avoid getting drawn
into such controversies.

00:55:13.122 --> 00:55:18.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, in practical terms,
what might that look like?

00:55:18.085 --> 00:55:21.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video, notice how adults

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:26.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
can respond effectively when questioned
on highly controversial issues.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:55:40.316 --> 00:55:42.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you both get the email survey I sent?

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re both coming, right?

00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:46.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I must have missed it.
I was on calls all morning.

00:55:46.447 --> 00:55:47.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s this about?

00:55:47.656 --> 00:55:49.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the whole office is leaving early.

00:55:49.825 --> 00:55:52.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going downtown
to support the march

00:55:52.745 --> 00:55:54.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
for gay rights.

00:55:55.497 --> 00:55:57.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
She won’t go.

00:55:57.499 --> 00:55:58.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:55:58.751 --> 00:56:00.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s against her religion.

00:56:00.419 --> 00:56:02.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of her people came by my house,

00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:05.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I asked, they said your church

00:56:05.299 --> 00:56:07.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t support gay marriage.

00:56:08.177 --> 00:56:09.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irene?

00:56:12.723 --> 00:56:13.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true.

00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:17.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we hold to the Bible’s standard on marriage,

00:56:17.895 --> 00:56:21.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is only between a man and woman.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remain politically neutral.

00:56:23.901 --> 00:56:26.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s such ignorant thinking.

00:56:28.697 --> 00:56:31.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand it’s a sensitive subject.

00:56:31.492 --> 00:56:35.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a daughter who deserves her rights!

00:56:35.079 --> 00:56:39.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust me, Amber,
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:43.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
we believe everyone has a right
to choose how they live.

00:56:43.045 --> 00:56:46.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I would never force my beliefs on anyone.

00:56:46.257 --> 00:56:48.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you won’t go.

00:56:48.425 --> 00:56:50.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as I would never force
my beliefs on you,

00:56:50.511 --> 00:56:53.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
all I ask is the same respect.

00:56:54.306 --> 00:56:56.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, no, I won’t be going.

00:56:56.308 --> 00:56:58.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have to go back to work.

00:57:03.315 --> 00:57:05.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, obviously, Irene,

00:57:05.985 --> 00:57:08.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t agree with your perspective.

00:57:08.988 --> 00:57:12.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I do appreciate
that you not push it on anyone else.

00:57:12.157 --> 00:57:13.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:57:25.504 --> 00:57:29.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast with the majority of mankind
who are divided,

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
true Christians are united.

00:57:31.969 --> 00:57:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
We loyally support Jehovah’s right to rule.

00:57:35.389 --> 00:57:37.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t set the standards,

00:57:37.016 --> 00:57:39.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re not trying
to solve the world’s problems on our own.

00:57:39.643 --> 00:57:42.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We fully support God’s Kingdom.

00:57:42.104 --> 00:57:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we observed in the video,

00:57:44.106 --> 00:57:47.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
moral and political issues
might be brought up in the workplace.

00:57:47.776 --> 00:57:51.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more often our young ones,
even very young ones,

00:57:51.947 --> 00:57:54.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
are confronted with these same topics.

00:57:54.533 --> 00:57:56.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will they respond?

00:57:56.535 --> 00:57:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are your young ones ready?

00:57:59.038 --> 00:58:01.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the next video,

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:05.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Olivia defends
Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:09.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great discussion today, everyone.

00:58:09.465 --> 00:58:11.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, midterms are this Friday.

00:58:11.592 --> 00:58:13.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
No excuses!

00:58:13.427 --> 00:58:15.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes you, Jordan.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were noticeably silent
during our discussion today, Olivia.

00:58:20.726 --> 00:58:21.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was?

00:58:21.935 --> 00:58:24.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I just didn’t have much to say.

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aren’t you concerned about gay rights?

00:58:27.983 --> 00:58:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um,

00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:32.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, it seems like a political issue,

00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:36.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I stay neutral
when it comes to political stuff.

00:58:36.241 --> 00:58:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not a political issue.

00:58:38.494 --> 00:58:40.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a human rights issue.

00:58:40.496 --> 00:58:42.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Dallas,

00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:43.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s like crazy religious.

00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:44.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:58:44.375 --> 00:58:45.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:58:45.584 --> 00:58:46.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you don’t understand.

00:58:46.794 --> 00:58:49.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
hate everybody that isn’t straight.

00:58:49.296 --> 00:58:51.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not true! 
We don’t hate anyone.

00:58:51.548 --> 00:58:53.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve spoken with your people before.

00:58:54.802 --> 00:58:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seem big on equality.

00:58:56.512 --> 00:58:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are.

00:58:57.721 --> 00:58:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that ‘God isn’t partial.’

00:58:59.598 --> 00:59:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we believe that everyone
should be treated fairly.

00:59:04.019 --> 00:59:05.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:59:05.938 --> 00:59:09.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I assume you have
gay members in your church.

00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:12.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we don’t.

00:59:15.531 --> 00:59:18.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought you just said
everyone should be treated equally?

00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:21.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m confused.

00:59:21.328 --> 00:59:22.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hah, called it!

00:59:22.746 --> 00:59:25.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jordan, don’t you have a class to get to?

00:59:26.708 --> 00:59:28.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was saying,

00:59:29.711 --> 00:59:32.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
how is that not a little hypocritical,

00:59:32.714 --> 00:59:36.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that you love everyone
and then excluding certain people?

00:59:44.226 --> 00:59:46.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, Mr. Dallas,

00:59:49.064 --> 00:59:51.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve wondered the same thing.

00:59:51.692 --> 00:59:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And?

00:59:55.571 --> 00:59:58.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I researched it in the Bible,
and I realized

00:59:58.949 --> 01:00:03.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God accepts all people,
but he doesn’t accept all conduct.

01:00:05.456 --> 01:00:07.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

01:00:08.834 --> 01:00:12.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that you can’t be abusing drugs

01:00:12.504 --> 01:00:14.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can’t be stealing

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be violent and still be a Witness.

01:00:19.678 --> 01:00:23.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are just certain actions
that God just doesn’t accept.

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:30.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Including how someone expresses
their sexuality?

01:00:31.857 --> 01:00:33.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases, yes.

01:00:33.275 --> 01:00:35.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
We follow God’s standards

01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:37.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not having sex without being married.

01:00:38.906 --> 01:00:39.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:44.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
if that’s how you feel, that’s your right.

01:00:44.578 --> 01:00:48.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, it seems a tad archaic to me 

01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:50.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to each their own.

01:00:57.716 --> 01:00:58.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

01:00:58.717 --> 01:00:59.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

01:00:59.718 --> 01:01:02.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the Bible really say all that?

01:01:02.763 --> 01:01:05.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it does.

01:01:05.182 --> 01:01:06.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK,

01:01:06.183 --> 01:01:08.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe you can show me sometime.

01:01:08.185 --> 01:01:09.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.

01:01:09.603 --> 01:01:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Awesome.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:39.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can expect future installments
in this saga.

01:01:39.424 --> 01:01:41.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you notice how Olivia

01:01:41.843 --> 01:01:45.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
was able to defend
Jehovah’s righteous standards?

01:01:45.138 --> 01:01:47.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
She kept her peaceful spirit, didn’t she?

01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
She acknowledged that she had
the same question as the teacher,

01:01:50.727 --> 01:01:53.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she had done further
research on the subject.

01:01:53.438 --> 01:01:57.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you appreciate how she
subtly showed that Jehovah’s standards

01:01:57.317 --> 01:02:00.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit both the individual
and the community?

01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:04.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
As examples, she highlighted
the avoidance of drug abuse and theft,

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
values she knew her teacher would appreciate.

01:02:08.662 --> 01:02:11.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, are your young ones

01:02:11.123 --> 01:02:14.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
able to explain why we do

01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:16.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
or don’t do certain things?

01:02:16.503 --> 01:02:18.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know how your children

01:02:18.714 --> 01:02:21.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
really feel about Jehovah’s standards?

01:02:21.425 --> 01:02:25.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they obedient simply
to avoid making you mad?

01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:30.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, will that truly be enough?

01:02:30.851 --> 01:02:32.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Encourage your young ones

01:02:32.853 --> 01:02:36.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prove to themselves
why Jehovah’s standards are wise.

01:02:36.898 --> 01:02:39.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them to see how they can explain

01:02:39.443 --> 01:02:41.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
their choice to live by Jehovah’s standards.

01:02:41.987 --> 01:02:46.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teach them how to resist pressure
to follow the world.

01:02:48.869 --> 01:02:51.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so thankful

01:02:51.622 --> 01:02:55.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even during these
“critical times hard to deal with”

01:02:55.917 --> 01:03:00.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can enjoy the inner peace
that Jehovah gives to the righteous.

01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:04.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s remind ourselves of what Jehovah
promises to bring about

01:03:04.968 --> 01:03:08.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
once Satan’s unrighteous system is removed.

01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:12.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Psalm 37.

01:03:13.935 --> 01:03:16.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in these familiar verses,

01:03:16.188 --> 01:03:19.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find a beautiful description
of what is to come.

01:03:19.858 --> 01:03:21.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice once again

01:03:21.985 --> 01:03:24.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the Bible makes the correlation

01:03:24.279 --> 01:03:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
between peace and righteousness

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 37:29.

01:03:30.786 --> 01:03:32.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have it?

01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:35.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:38.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who will possess the earth?

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous.”

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:43.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for how long will they live on it?

01:03:43.298 --> 01:03:45.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forever.”

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then according to verse 11,
what will they find there?

01:03:51.473 --> 01:03:53.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace.”

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result of true righteousness
will be peace.

01:03:56.978 --> 01:03:59.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how much peace will they find?

01:03:59.064 --> 01:04:02.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little peace?
just personal or family peace?

01:04:02.067 --> 01:04:04.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the righteous
already had peace with God,

01:04:04.111 --> 01:04:06.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when wicked people still existed.

01:04:06.238 --> 01:04:10.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what will Jehovah provide
to all those who continue loving him?

01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:14.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
The abundance of peace.

01:04:14.746 --> 01:04:17.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how will you feel about that?

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:22.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Delighted or exquisitely delighted?

01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:24.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stick with it, dear friends.

01:04:24.381 --> 01:04:27.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this convention, be on the lookout
for the connection

01:04:27.384 --> 01:04:29.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
between peace and righteousness.

01:04:29.845 --> 01:04:32.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue on the course of righteousness.

01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:34.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help others to find “the way of peace.”

01:04:34.516 --> 01:04:37.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, we can enjoy peace
with Jehovah now,

01:04:37.769 --> 01:04:40.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the remainder of these last days,

01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:44.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on into the future when Jesus
rules as King over a cleansed earth

01:04:44.651 --> 01:04:49.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which “the righteous will flourish
and peace will abound.”

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:54.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Schafer,
for helping us to understand

01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:57.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
why upholding Jehovah’s righteousness

01:04:57.372 --> 01:05:00.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential for enjoying true peace.

01:05:01.835 --> 01:05:04.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been well-instructed

01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:07.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this first session of our convention,
haven’t we?

01:05:07.799 --> 01:05:10.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to our next session

01:05:10.177 --> 01:05:12.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which we will consider in greater detail

01:05:12.888 --> 01:05:17.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
promises of peace found in God’s Word.

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:21.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will also see how Bible principles
can help families

01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:23.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy greater peace now

01:05:23.523 --> 01:05:27.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can avoid pursuing
imitation peace.

01:05:29.946 --> 01:05:32.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s conclude this session

01:05:32.574 --> 01:05:36.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
by singing song number 97, entitled

01:05:36.286 --> 01:05:39.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Life Depends on God’s Word.”

01:05:39.748 --> 01:05:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
After singing the song,

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:45.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may have your local concluding prayer.

01:05:45.003 --> 01:05:48.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, that’s song number 97.

WEBVTT

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body
and all of those working

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s my pleasure to welcome you

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the 2022 “Pursue Peace”! Convention.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
These convention segments,

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
which constitute special editions

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting® this month and next,

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been translated
into more than 500 languages.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture theme
for this session and the next

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Psalm 29:11:

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch
the following music-video presentation,

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the peace we find

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
by observing Jehovah’s creations,
reading his Word,

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:17.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sharing his message with others.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:44.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are delighted you could join us
for the opening session

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:49.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the “Pursue Peace”! Convention
of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s sing together song number 86, entitled

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:56.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We Must Be Taught.”

00:10:56.092 --> 00:10:58.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 86.

00:12:58.173 --> 00:13:01.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of peace does God give,

00:13:01.092 --> 00:13:03.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to whom does he give it?

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Stephen Lett, a member
of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:13.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
will answer these questions
in the opening talk of our program.

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:17.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention
as he develops the theme

00:13:17.942 --> 00:13:21.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah Is ‘the God Who Gives Peace.’”

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:31.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is my great pleasure

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:33.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warmly welcome all of you

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to say, <i>“Shalom.”</i>

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is saying that appropriate?

00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:42.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>shalom </i> is the Hebrew word for “peace,”

00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:46.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it occurs over 200 times in the Bible.

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it’s used as a greeting
(just as I used it),

00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:53.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means: “May you have peace.”

00:13:53.895 --> 00:13:58.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what could be a more appropriate way
to greet all of you at the start

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this “Pursue Peace”!
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:06.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are very pleased that you’re with us,

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we assure you
that you will not be disappointed.

00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:13.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary, you’ll be glad you were able

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:17.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
to devote three days to learning
what the Bible says

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to gain and maintain peace

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all areas of your life.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s begin
by talking about the Person

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:32.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has drawn us all together
for this convention—Jehovah.

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:34.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how we delight in talking

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our marvelous heavenly Father!

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 4:9

00:14:39.482 --> 00:14:42.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
calls Jehovah “the God of peace.”

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true
that he possesses many qualities

00:14:45.113 --> 00:14:48.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love, justice, wisdom, power—

00:14:48.116 --> 00:14:51.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also possesses the quality of peace.

00:14:51.453 --> 00:14:54.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you think about it,
he is at peace with himself,

00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:56.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
at peace with angels,

00:14:56.666 --> 00:14:58.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
at peace with faithful humans.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he is “the God of peace.”

00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:07.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now here’s a question:
Does Jehovah keep this peace to himself?

00:15:07.051 --> 00:15:11.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s get the answer
at Romans chapter 15.

00:15:11.264 --> 00:15:13.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans chapter 15

00:15:13.558 --> 00:15:18.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and please let’s read verse 33:

00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:22.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives peace

00:15:22.442 --> 00:15:25.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
be with all of you. Amen.”

00:15:25.403 --> 00:15:28.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he generously gives this peace,
as we’ll be discussing.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he gives
“every good gift and every perfect present,”

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to James 1:17.

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:38.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of his finest presents
is the gift of peace.

00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:40.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now here’s another question:

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:43.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of peace does Jehovah give?

00:15:43.713 --> 00:15:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many equate peace

00:15:45.715 --> 00:15:49.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
with freedom from conflict
and strife in one’s life.

00:15:49.552 --> 00:15:53.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the peace Jehovah gives
is a lot more than that.

00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:57.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace that only Jehovah can supply

00:15:57.143 --> 00:15:59.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings in feelings of safety,

00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:03.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
security, well-being.

00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Jehovah-given peace

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:07.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
is described very nicely
in Philippians chapter 4.

00:16:07.946 --> 00:16:09.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go there.

00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:12.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians chapter 4 beginning in verse 6:

00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:15.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:18.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in everything by prayer and supplication

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:21.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with thanksgiving,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let your petitions be made known to God;

00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:29.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding

00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:32.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will guard your hearts
and your mental powers

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:35.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:16:35.223 --> 00:16:40.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice that Jehovah is saying:
“Do not be anxious over anything.”

00:16:40.228 --> 00:16:42.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Jehovah tell us to do something

00:16:42.772 --> 00:16:45.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was impossible for us to do?

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:46.442 --> 00:16:49.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, obviously, he’s talking about not being

00:16:49.737 --> 00:16:52.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
overly anxious.

00:16:52.365 --> 00:16:55.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Controlled anxiety
can actually be beneficial.

00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:58.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can move us to show concern for others.

00:16:58.997 --> 00:17:04.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can motivate us to work enthusiastically
to accomplish an assignment.

00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:07.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what about excessive,
uncontrolled anxiety?

00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:09.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that can lead to physical problems.

00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depression can be crippling,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
debilitating, enfeebling.

00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:17.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how can we avoid

00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:22.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
being overly anxious over anything?

00:17:22.228 --> 00:17:26.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is given in the next words
of Philippians 4:6, 7.

00:17:26.858 --> 00:17:31.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
After telling us not to be anxious,
Jehovah gives the antidote.

00:17:31.487 --> 00:17:35.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
He basically tells us to pray,
supplicate, and petition him,

00:17:35.158 --> 00:17:38.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will get that “peace of God.”

00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what does the scripture mean

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:45.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it says that this ‘peace of God

00:17:45.627 --> 00:17:49.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
surpasses all understanding’?

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we could say
that it’s so amazing and so powerful

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:56.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we limited humans
cannot fully understand it.

00:17:56.596 --> 00:18:00.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
It defies logic from a human standpoint.

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hearts and minds may be filled
with so much worry, fear, anxiety

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:07.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we see no way out, but we beg Jehovah

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the peace that he can supply.

00:18:10.276 --> 00:18:12.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what happens?

00:18:12.278 --> 00:18:17.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our minds and hearts
are amazingly filled with calmness,

00:18:17.283 --> 00:18:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
security, tranquility.

00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:23.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loraine, a young girl

00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:26.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose mother was dying
of cancer, said this:

00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:31.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was in the room
when my mother took her last breath.

00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:33.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I . . . asked Jehovah
to give me the strength

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:36.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to endure and to get through this.

00:18:36.803 --> 00:18:41.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
I immediately felt the peace of God.”

00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:45.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what is meant by the expression

00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:49.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the peace of God . . .
will guard your hearts

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:51.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your mental powers”?

00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:54.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Greek word translated “guard”

00:18:54.195 --> 00:18:57.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a military term
that evokes a mental picture

00:18:57.865 --> 00:19:01.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
of soldiers
maintaining a day-and-night watch.

00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:03.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same way,

00:19:03.162 --> 00:19:06.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
this peace of God
can act like a 24-hour guard

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:09.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
over our hearts and mental powers

00:19:09.836 --> 00:19:14.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
—keeping them calm, secure, and tranquil.

00:19:14.298 --> 00:19:16.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a question:

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the key ingredient

00:19:18.678 --> 00:19:23.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our being able to receive
this miraculous peace of God?

00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:28.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer:
Having a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:19:28.938 --> 00:19:32.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul
experienced firsthand many times

00:19:32.817 --> 00:19:35.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that having inner peace depends,

00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on circumstances,

00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:41.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, on a close,
personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:41.576 --> 00:19:43.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, on one occasion

00:19:43.953 --> 00:19:47.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Paul and Silas boldly preached,

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:50.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had their garments ripped off of them.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were beaten—many blows with rods.

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:55.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were thrown into the inner prison.

00:19:55.882 --> 00:19:59.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their feet were fastened in stocks.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the middle of the night,

00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:03.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did Paul and Silas begin to do?

00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:08.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to pray
and sing songs of praise to Jehovah.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
In amazement,

00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:13.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the other prisoners
were listening to them.

00:20:13.775 --> 00:20:18.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, their very,
very unfavorable circumstances

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:22.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
had not robbed them
of their precious peace of God.

00:20:22.408 --> 00:20:25.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s learn
this valuable lesson from Paul and Silas.

00:20:25.995 --> 00:20:28.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having the peace of God

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:32.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not dependent on our circumstances,
but it is dependent

00:20:32.835 --> 00:20:37.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
on having a close,
personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:43.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus far, we’ve discussed how Jehovah
is the God of peace who gives peace,

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:45.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve talked
about what kind of peace he gives.

00:20:45.807 --> 00:20:47.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:20:47.683 --> 00:20:52.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom does Jehovah give peace?

00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:54.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simple answer is,

00:20:54.023 --> 00:20:58.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives peace
to those who draw close to him

00:20:58.194 --> 00:21:01.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
and want to follow his guidance.

00:21:01.322 --> 00:21:04.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
So receiving peace from Jehovah starts

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
with living a clean life,

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
following Jehovah’s
righteous moral standards.

00:21:10.498 --> 00:21:13.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in Satan’s world, as you know,

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:17.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
believe that God will accept them as they are

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:21.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that God in effect
will lower his standard to accommodate them.

00:21:21.509 --> 00:21:23.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine such pride?

00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:28.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be like a pot
telling its maker, the potter,

00:21:28.724 --> 00:21:31.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the pot must be used,

00:21:31.352 --> 00:21:35.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the potter must accept this,
whether he likes it or not.

00:21:35.273 --> 00:21:37.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know
it doesn’t work that way, does it?

00:21:37.817 --> 00:21:40.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to come up
to Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:21:40.945 --> 00:21:44.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he’ll help us, but we do the changing

00:21:44.157 --> 00:21:46.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
—certainly not Jehovah.

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:50.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, James 3:17

00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:54.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that “the wisdom from above

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:57.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is first of all pure,

00:21:57.253 --> 00:21:59.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
then peaceable.”

00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:01.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we want peace from Jehovah

00:22:01.591 --> 00:22:03.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will result in peaceful lives,

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:08.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be pure
according to Jehovah’s moral standards.

00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:11.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 48:22 reads:

00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:16.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘There is no peace,’
says Jehovah, ‘for the wicked.’”

00:22:16.105 --> 00:22:17.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or put another way,

00:22:17.899 --> 00:22:20.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who wickedly set
their own moral standards

00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive no peace from Jehovah
and will not have peaceful lives.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we work hard
to live by Jehovah’s standards.

00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:33.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true
that Jehovah does his part to help us,

00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:37.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he does expect us to do our part.

00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:40.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could say that his blessing on our effort

00:22:40.213 --> 00:22:43.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
is somewhat like multiplication.

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:45.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean?

00:22:45.051 --> 00:22:49.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we put forth no effort,
there’s nothing for Jehovah to multiply.

00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:51.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is ten times zero?

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:53.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:55.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
a hundred times zero?
a thousand times zero?

00:22:55.436 --> 00:22:57.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
a million times zero?

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still have zero.

00:22:58.898 --> 00:23:03.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we don’t do anything,
Jehovah has nothing to multiply.

00:23:03.903 --> 00:23:08.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 5:22 tells us that peace

00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:11.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an aspect
of “the fruitage of the [holy] spirit.”

00:23:11.827 --> 00:23:16.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the holy spirit will help us
cultivate and demonstrate peace.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, John 14:26

00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:22.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes the holy spirit as a “helper.”

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that expression “helper”

00:23:25.007 --> 00:23:29.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t indicate
it will miraculously do the job for us

00:23:29.053 --> 00:23:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no effort on our part.

00:23:31.472 --> 00:23:33.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate this if we can:

00:23:33.474 --> 00:23:36.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine that you’re working very hard

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
to paint the outside of your house,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a good friend comes to help you.

00:23:41.148 --> 00:23:43.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re painting together.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then you decide,

00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:49.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ll just go back in the house,
and I’ll just take it easy.’

00:23:49.031 --> 00:23:52.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how long
will your friend keep painting?

00:23:52.201 --> 00:23:56.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he continued painting,
he’s no longer a helper;

00:23:56.247 --> 00:23:58.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s doing the job for you.

00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:01.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 11:13 tells us that Jehovah

00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:06.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “give holy spirit
to those asking him” for it.

00:24:06.173 --> 00:24:08.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we ask for holy spirit

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:12.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then do our very best
to work in harmony with that helper,

00:24:12.596 --> 00:24:15.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy peace with God

00:24:15.182 --> 00:24:18.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will enjoy and promote harmony,

00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:21.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
unity, and good relations with others.

00:24:21.814 --> 00:24:26.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a pleasure it is
to associate with those who display peace

00:24:26.402 --> 00:24:31.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this important aspect
of the spirit’s fruitage!

00:24:32.033 --> 00:24:34.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a sleeping baby

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
is suddenly awakened
in the middle of the night by a loud noise,

00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:41.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
he becomes frightened
—doesn’t he?—

00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:43.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he cries out for help.

00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:46.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when a parent cuddles him

00:24:46.589 --> 00:24:50.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and soothes him with reassuring words,

00:24:50.384 --> 00:24:52.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
he calms down immediately.

00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, David at Psalm 55:16-18

00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:02.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
said that when he was troubled,
he ‘called out to God’

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Jehovah
‘heard his voice’ and ‘gave him peace.’

00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:10.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like David, when we’re in anguish,

00:25:10.863 --> 00:25:13.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can supplicate our heavenly Father,

00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:18.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will soothe and restore our peace.

00:25:18.996 --> 00:25:24.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, our loving Father
is eager to do this for us.

00:25:24.001 --> 00:25:26.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open up to Jeremiah chapter 29,

00:25:26.462 --> 00:25:31.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice that he’s eager
to replace our anxiety

00:25:31.092 --> 00:25:33.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the peace from him.

00:25:34.929 --> 00:25:37.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 29:11:

00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:41.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you,’

00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“declares Jehovah,

00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:47.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:49.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to give you a future and a hope.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:54.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And you will call me
and come and pray to me,

00:25:54.865 --> 00:25:59.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will listen to you.’”

00:25:59.161 --> 00:26:01.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:26:01.038 --> 00:26:06.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our God is ready, willing, and able
to replace our anxieties

00:26:06.043 --> 00:26:10.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this amazing peace
that only he can give.

00:26:10.923 --> 00:26:15.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve now discussed
how Jehovah is the God of peace.

00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:18.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve discussed who he gives the peace to

00:26:18.097 --> 00:26:20.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to those who draw close to him

00:26:20.558 --> 00:26:23.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and earnestly seek peace from him.

00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:27.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s examine how each of us

00:26:27.523 --> 00:26:31.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
can promote peace with others.

00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:33.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:26:33.237 --> 00:26:35.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook of the Governing Body

00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:39.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
will explain how this convention program

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to pursue peace.

00:26:44.582 --> 00:26:46.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:49.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that we really appreciate

00:26:49.503 --> 00:26:52.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
your attending
this “Pursue Peace”! Convention.

00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:55.384 line:10% position:50% align:center
Speaking of peace,

00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:57.386 line:10% position:50% align:center
we love the serene setting

00:26:57.386 --> 00:26:59.430 line:10% position:50% align:center
here at our world headquarters

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Blue Lake in New York State.

00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:06.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the water is as smooth as a mirror.

00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:10.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
We occasionally see eagles and hawks fly by.

00:27:10.983 --> 00:27:14.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the fall of the year
when the leaves change color,

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
the forest can look spectacular.

00:27:18.157 --> 00:27:20.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
More important
than this tranquil setting, though,

00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:22.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the abundant peace

00:27:22.495 --> 00:27:26.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to his organization.

00:27:26.081 --> 00:27:30.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can say this because of the peace
and harmony that unite us

00:27:30.878 --> 00:27:32.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what our nationality,

00:27:32.922 --> 00:27:37.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
language, race, tribe,
or social background is.

00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:40.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is truly spectacular,

00:27:40.429 --> 00:27:45.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we consider
all the turmoil in the world

00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:47.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how divided people are

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:51.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
politically, socially, and religiously.

00:27:51.398 --> 00:27:56.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we cannot take
our beautiful peace for granted;

00:27:56.028 --> 00:27:58.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not maintained automatically.

00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:02.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us personally must pursue peace

00:28:02.284 --> 00:28:04.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to have God’s approval.

00:28:04.828 --> 00:28:09.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly wants his worshippers
to enjoy lasting peace.

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:12.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was true in ancient times.

00:28:12.002 --> 00:28:15.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
God told Moses to have the priests in Israel

00:28:15.214 --> 00:28:19.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
bless the people with very reassuring words.

00:28:19.176 --> 00:28:21.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice these words that we find

00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:26.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Numbers 6:24-26,

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hear what the priests
were to say to the people:

00:28:29.853 --> 00:28:34.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you.

00:28:34.525 --> 00:28:37.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah make his face shine upon you,

00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:39.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and may he favor you.

00:28:39.822 --> 00:28:42.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah lift up his face toward you

00:28:42.783 --> 00:28:44.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grant you peace.”

00:28:45.995 --> 00:28:47.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next verse states:

00:28:47.246 --> 00:28:49.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they must place my name

00:28:49.248 --> 00:28:51.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“upon the people of Israel,

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I may bless them.”

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:56.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has placed his name on us too,

00:28:56.797 --> 00:28:59.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is richly blessing us.

00:28:59.717 --> 00:29:03.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what
this convention program is going to cover

00:29:03.554 --> 00:29:06.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’ll know how we can continue

00:29:06.223 --> 00:29:09.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy God’s blessing of peace.

00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:14.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll consider
how to be at peace with God.

00:29:14.398 --> 00:29:16.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our greatest peace comes

00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:20.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
from having
a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:23.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making him our best Friend benefits us

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:28.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leads to peace
in every other aspect of our life.

00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:33.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we reach out
for a close relationship with God?

00:29:33.042 --> 00:29:36.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need more
than a superficial knowledge of him.

00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:40.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to get to know Jehovah as a person

00:29:40.132 --> 00:29:43.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and admire his qualities and ways.

00:29:43.093 --> 00:29:45.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we can love what he loves

00:29:45.846 --> 00:29:48.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hate what he hates.

00:29:48.682 --> 00:29:50.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this program,

00:29:50.684 --> 00:29:53.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen for details about Jehovah

00:29:53.062 --> 00:29:56.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will draw you ever closer to him.

00:29:57.024 --> 00:30:01.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we’ll consider
how to be at peace with others.

00:30:01.445 --> 00:30:04.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our homes should be havens
for peace for our families.

00:30:05.991 --> 00:30:08.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means more than the absence of arguing.

00:30:08.869 --> 00:30:13.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves putting the interests
of our family members ahead of our own.

00:30:13.874 --> 00:30:16.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ll learn from this program,

00:30:16.418 --> 00:30:19.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
that includes showing love
and respect to one another,

00:30:19.838 --> 00:30:21.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
working as a team,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
improving family communication,

00:30:24.343 --> 00:30:27.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worshipping Jehovah together.

00:30:28.055 --> 00:30:30.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we’ll consider

00:30:30.307 --> 00:30:32.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to be at peace despite trials

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and troublesome world conditions.

00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:40.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this convention,
we’re going to tour the world to see how,

00:30:40.025 --> 00:30:43.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite opposition, illness,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic problems, and natural disasters,

00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:50.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers really care for one another,

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:53.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they receive help
from Jehovah’s organization,

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they continue
their spiritual activity.

00:30:57.251 --> 00:31:01.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what may threaten
our lives or livelihood,

00:31:01.296 --> 00:31:05.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be confident
that Jehovah can help us get through it

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:08.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and retain our peace of mind and heart.

00:31:09.012 --> 00:31:11.181 line:10% position:50% align:center
Fourth, we’ll consider

00:31:11.181 --> 00:31:13.851 line:10% position:50% align:center
how to enjoy peace eternally.

00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:18.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once God’s Kingdom
has lifted mankind to perfection,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll no longer have to pursue peace.

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:25.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Psalm 72:7 promises:

00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:27.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will flourish,

00:31:27.406 --> 00:31:31.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace will abound
until the moon is no more.”

00:31:31.452 --> 00:31:35.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, there will be peace forever.

00:31:35.873 --> 00:31:38.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
This program will help us

00:31:38.292 --> 00:31:41.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anticipate future blessings from Jehovah.

00:31:41.962 --> 00:31:44.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see why “Pursue Peace!”

00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:48.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
was well chosen
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:31:48.469 --> 00:31:50.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
To pursue something means

00:31:50.637 --> 00:31:54.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
to chase it in order to capture it.

00:31:54.016 --> 00:31:56.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the influence of Satan,

00:31:56.518 --> 00:31:59.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
his wicked world, and our own imperfections,

00:31:59.897 --> 00:32:02.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace is constantly trying to elude us.

00:32:02.983 --> 00:32:07.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we have to chase after it
to capture it in our lives.

00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:12.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention program will help us do that.

00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:17.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
May the God of peace
be with all of you now and forever!

00:32:17.414 --> 00:32:22.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the heartfelt wish
of all of us on the Governing Body

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:25.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love you dearly.

00:32:25.255 --> 00:32:29.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the entire convention program!

00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:35.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warmly thank Brother Cook
for highlighting

00:32:35.516 --> 00:32:38.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of the ways
this convention program

00:32:38.227 --> 00:32:41.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to pursue peace.

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:44.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s briefly preview

00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:48.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
the convention program that is coming our way

00:32:48.946 --> 00:32:51.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been provided by the God of peace,

00:32:51.657 --> 00:32:55.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you may want to follow along
by using your copy

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:57.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the convention program.

00:32:57.663 --> 00:33:00.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll note that day one has the theme

00:33:00.332 --> 00:33:04.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”

00:33:04.378 --> 00:33:07.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first symposium will illustrate

00:33:07.464 --> 00:33:09.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
how love for God, love for neighbor,

00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:11.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love for God’s Word

00:33:11.593 --> 00:33:15.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
lead to genuine peace.

00:33:15.264 --> 00:33:17.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s dramatic Bible reading

00:33:17.808 --> 00:33:20.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
is based on the life of Jacob.

00:33:20.894 --> 00:33:24.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you will see,
Jacob gives us an excellent example

00:33:24.898 --> 00:33:28.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to how we can
“pursue the things

00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:31.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
making for peace.”

00:33:31.446 --> 00:33:34.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thereafter, we’ll have the talk

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:38.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Result of True Righteousness
Will Be Peace,”

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see in that talk
how we can resist temptation.

00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:48.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as a lion devours prey
and assimilates it into his body,

00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:51.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan tries to get us
to succumb to temptations

00:33:51.842 --> 00:33:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he can devour us
and assimilate us into his world.

00:33:56.346 --> 00:34:01.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during that talk,
we’ll learn how to reject his temptations.

00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:04.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in the second half of day one,

00:34:04.062 --> 00:34:07.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll enjoy our second convention symposium,

00:34:07.566 --> 00:34:12.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace.”

00:34:12.154 --> 00:34:16.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will be greatly heartened
by Jehovah’s promises of peace

00:34:16.658 --> 00:34:18.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in the book of Isaiah.

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:21.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, one of the talks has the theme

00:34:21.413 --> 00:34:25.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Wolf and the Lamb Will Feed Together.”

00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:30.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we can’t even imagine
feeding a wolf and a lamb together.

00:34:30.297 --> 00:34:34.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we tried such, it would likely result

00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:37.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
in lamb chops for the wolf.

00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:41.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s promise in Isaiah assures us

00:34:41.475 --> 00:34:44.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
that peace will exist
between humans and animals

00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:48.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and between animals and other animals.

00:34:49.107 --> 00:34:54.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third convention symposium
has a thought-provoking theme

00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:58.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace.”

00:34:58.408 --> 00:35:01.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how, despite challenges,

00:35:01.203 --> 00:35:04.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
marriage mates, parents, and children

00:35:04.456 --> 00:35:09.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
can successfully follow
that road map to family peace.

00:35:09.169 --> 00:35:11.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we’ll enjoy the talk

00:35:11.588 --> 00:35:14.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Loyally Support the ‘Prince of Peace.’”

00:35:14.883 --> 00:35:16.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
That talk will remind us

00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:19.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the importance
of maintaining our neutrality

00:35:19.638 --> 00:35:23.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not taking sides on political issues.

00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:27.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
To conclude day one,
we’ll have the intriguing talk

00:35:27.354 --> 00:35:32.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do Not Be Misled by Imitation Peace!”

00:35:32.234 --> 00:35:35.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will contrast the world’s so-called peace

00:35:35.195 --> 00:35:37.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a genuine peace

00:35:37.197 --> 00:35:40.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will give his followers.

00:35:40.242 --> 00:35:42.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then on day two,

00:35:42.244 --> 00:35:44.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the theme

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:49.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be found . . . spotless
and unblemished and in peace.”

00:35:49.334 --> 00:35:52.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second day starts with a symposium

00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:56.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to invigorate us for our ministry

00:35:56.591 --> 00:35:58.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can be ready

00:35:58.593 --> 00:36:02.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the good news of peace.

00:36:03.223 --> 00:36:05.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will be followed by the talk

00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:10.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Young People
—Choose a Path That Leads to Peace!”

00:36:10.772 --> 00:36:13.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that talk will encourage
our dear young ones

00:36:13.692 --> 00:36:16.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue the full-time ministry.

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:18.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to say to you dear young ones

00:36:18.196 --> 00:36:22.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if you do this,
you will enjoy a happy life

00:36:22.034 --> 00:36:24.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have no regrets.

00:36:24.786 --> 00:36:27.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we will see a video

00:36:27.372 --> 00:36:29.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows how our brothers around the world

00:36:29.624 --> 00:36:32.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
are continuing their spiritual activity

00:36:32.753 --> 00:36:37.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are enjoying peace
despite difficult trials.

00:36:37.674 --> 00:36:39.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a highlight of the day

00:36:39.885 --> 00:36:43.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be the baptism
of new disciples of Jesus.

00:36:43.221 --> 00:36:46.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the baptism talk, the baptism candidates

00:36:46.516 --> 00:36:51.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be encouraged
to “Go On Walking ‘in the Way of Peace.’”

00:36:51.521 --> 00:36:53.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why?

00:36:53.231 --> 00:36:57.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because this is truly the best way of life.

00:36:57.694 --> 00:37:02.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two more symposiums
will use video dramatizations

00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:05.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
to contrast traits of peace wreckers

00:37:05.452 --> 00:37:09.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the qualities of peacemakers.

00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:14.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a stark contrast between the two
you’ll see in these symposiums!

00:37:14.336 --> 00:37:18.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s kind of like the contrast
between bitter and sweet.

00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:23.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part 1 of this year’s Bible drama

00:37:23.178 --> 00:37:28.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
will remind us of ancient examples
of God’s people who pursued peace,

00:37:28.183 --> 00:37:31.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll definitely be able
to relate to their examples

00:37:31.436 --> 00:37:35.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and relate it
to our current situation in life.

00:37:35.607 --> 00:37:38.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day will conclude with showing us

00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:42.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to “Safeguard
Our ‘Uniting Bond of Peace’!”

00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:44.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how we can do so

00:37:44.783 --> 00:37:47.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
by putting the application
of Bible principles

00:37:47.702 --> 00:37:52.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
always ahead
of following local culture and traditions.

00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:55.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now on day three, the theme is

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:37:57.671 --> 00:38:02.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill you with all joy and peace.”

00:38:02.008 --> 00:38:06.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opening symposium
will examine seven examples

00:38:06.513 --> 00:38:10.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
of ones who sowed peace and reaped peace.

00:38:10.809 --> 00:38:14.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will examine Joseph and his brothers,

00:38:14.229 --> 00:38:17.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gibeonites, Gideon, Abigail,

00:38:17.524 --> 00:38:20.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth, Paul and Barnabas,

00:38:20.527 --> 00:38:22.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and modern examples.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:28.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly hope that many accept our invitation
to hear the enlightening

00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:30.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
public Bible discourse

00:38:30.245 --> 00:38:35.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Friendship With God
—How Possible?”

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we think about it,

00:38:37.252 --> 00:38:39.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not born as friends of God

00:38:39.337 --> 00:38:42.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re born
as sinful offspring of Adam.

00:38:42.549 --> 00:38:44.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, if you think about it,

00:38:44.551 --> 00:38:46.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re born as enemies of God.

00:38:46.678 --> 00:38:49.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you’ll hear
people say of a little baby,

00:38:49.598 --> 00:38:52.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look at that little angel,”

00:38:52.184 --> 00:38:55.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
but more accurate would be to say,

00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:58.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look at that little enemy of God.”

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, we love that little baby.

00:39:00.192 --> 00:39:03.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not hopeless
because our loving Creator

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
has made reconciliation with him

00:39:06.072 --> 00:39:09.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the reach of everyone.

00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:11.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can become a good friend of God.

00:39:11.745 --> 00:39:14.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that close relationship with Jehovah

00:39:14.289 --> 00:39:18.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
will become our most valuable possession.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then after we enjoy
Part 2 of the Bible drama,

00:39:22.255 --> 00:39:24.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
the concluding talk of this convention

00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:28.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
will fill our hearts with a joyful prospect

00:39:28.261 --> 00:39:33.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Universal Peace Is Sure to Come!”

00:39:33.266 --> 00:39:37.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s guaranteed by the God “who cannot lie.”

00:39:37.729 --> 00:39:41.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, we’ll join in singing
a beautiful new original song

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:45.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll close with a prayer of praise
to Jehovah,

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Source of peace.

00:39:48.365 --> 00:39:50.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,

00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:52.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a brief synopsis

00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:56.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our wonderful three-day convention

00:39:56.331 --> 00:40:01.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided by the God of peace
that is coming our way.

00:40:01.002 --> 00:40:03.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
And throughout,

00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:07.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
the program will be enhanced
with dozens of videos,

00:40:07.259 --> 00:40:11.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see our brothers
either in real-life settings

00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:16.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
or dramatizations
that we’ll definitely be able to relate to.

00:40:16.226 --> 00:40:18.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the following video

00:40:18.937 --> 00:40:21.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a little, or small, sampling of the videos

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will see during this convention.

00:40:25.902 --> 00:40:27.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone.

00:40:27.112 --> 00:40:29.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:30.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:40:30.573 --> 00:40:32.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:40:32.575 --> 00:40:34.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:40:34.536 --> 00:40:37.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to go up to the girls
and smash their phones.

00:40:37.998 --> 00:40:40.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neutral?
Ain’t no neutral.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:43.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:40:43.336 --> 00:40:45.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was feeling back then

00:40:45.297 --> 00:40:47.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just sadness,

00:40:47.424 --> 00:40:49.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
never really peace.

00:40:49.843 --> 00:40:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here.

00:40:52.387 --> 00:40:56.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
In June of 2018,

00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:02.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge group of armed men came to us.

00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:07.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:41:07.235 --> 00:41:10.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost us?

00:41:10.238 --> 00:41:12.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a choice.
You went behind my back!

00:41:13.908 --> 00:41:15.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s your mask?

00:41:15.076 --> 00:41:17.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know how many people
have actually gotten sick?

00:41:17.537 --> 00:41:18.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:41:19.873 --> 00:41:21.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what always happens.

00:41:21.958 --> 00:41:23.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just
about to lose all your strength,

00:41:23.877 --> 00:41:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:41:28.548 --> 00:41:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful that we made peace

00:41:30.759 --> 00:41:33.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the world turned upside down.

00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:39.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s an important question
for all of us:

00:41:39.934 --> 00:41:42.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we prepare our heart

00:41:42.687 --> 00:41:46.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive God’s peace
during this convention?

00:41:46.858 --> 00:41:50.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra 7:10 tells us

00:41:50.236 --> 00:41:55.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘Ezra prepared his heart
to consult the Law of Jehovah

00:41:55.241 --> 00:41:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to practice it,
and to teach it to the Israelites.’

00:41:59.204 --> 00:42:00.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what was the result?

00:42:00.955 --> 00:42:05.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11 tells us
he became “an expert in the study

00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:08.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the commandments of Jehovah.”

00:42:08.505 --> 00:42:10.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in imitation of Ezra,

00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:13.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we prepare our heart

00:42:13.843 --> 00:42:17.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what we’re going to take in
at this convention?

00:42:17.806 --> 00:42:21.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing (very important),
by prayer and meditation,

00:42:21.935 --> 00:42:25.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can make sure that our heart is ready,

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
receptive to receive Jehovah’s instruction.

00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:32.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can also make sure that in our heart,

00:42:32.654 --> 00:42:36.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are determined
to apply what Jehovah teaches us.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then another thing we can do

00:42:38.952 --> 00:42:41.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
is we can pay close attention

00:42:41.079 --> 00:42:43.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the music-video presentations

00:42:43.915 --> 00:42:48.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be shown before every session
as the convention begins.

00:42:48.044 --> 00:42:51.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these presentations
have been carefully crafted

00:42:51.965 --> 00:42:56.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help prepare our heart for each session.

00:42:56.511 --> 00:42:59.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much time, effort, and expense

00:42:59.472 --> 00:43:02.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been expended in preparing

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
these beautiful presentations.

00:43:04.811 --> 00:43:09.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please listen carefully
as the sounds and scenes

00:43:09.607 --> 00:43:13.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepare your heart to accept
the spiritual instruction

00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:15.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will follow.

00:43:15.947 --> 00:43:19.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, may each of us be determined

00:43:19.409 --> 00:43:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen attentively

00:43:22.287 --> 00:43:24.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what Jehovah is teaching us.

00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:28.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we be determined to imitate the psalmist

00:43:28.543 --> 00:43:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
who humbly stated at Psalm 85:8:

00:43:32.881 --> 00:43:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will listen
to what the true God Jehovah says,

00:43:36.885 --> 00:43:40.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he will speak peace to his people.”

00:43:40.805 --> 00:43:45.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we will learn
how to pursue peace with all people

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the praise of Jehovah, the God of peace,

00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:51.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
who blesses his people with peace.

00:43:51.608 --> 00:43:56.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we will be successful in pursuing peace

00:43:56.154 --> 00:43:59.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
until we no longer have to pursue it.

00:43:59.532 --> 00:44:02.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we mean?
Well, think about it.

00:44:02.327 --> 00:44:05.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah have to pursue peace?

00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:07.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he have to chase it
in an effort to try to catch it?

00:44:07.832 --> 00:44:09.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:44:09.209 --> 00:44:12.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah merely displays peace.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in the new world,

00:44:14.672 --> 00:44:17.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a wonderful time it will be

00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:20.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we no longer have to pursue peace,

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
but like Jehovah,
we can merely display peace.

00:44:25.016 --> 00:44:30.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
But right now, let’s be determined
to continue to pursue peace.

00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:32.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may this wonderful convention

00:44:32.774 --> 00:44:37.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is coming our way help us to do so!

00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:43.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Lett, for helping us
prepare our hearts

00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:45.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the rest of the program.

00:44:45.411 --> 00:44:50.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are ready for Jehovah to teach us
how to pursue peace.

00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:55.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is peace related to love?

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:57.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we show love?

00:44:57.257 --> 00:45:00.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what blessings result when we do?

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:05.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first symposium of this convention
will answer those questions.

00:45:05.598 --> 00:45:07.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Seth Hyatt,

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Service Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:45:10.853 --> 00:45:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
will begin with the talk

00:45:12.855 --> 00:45:17.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Love Leads to Genuine Peace
—Love for God.”

00:45:25.451 --> 00:45:27.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:45:27.745 --> 00:45:30.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a connection, a relationship,

00:45:30.873 --> 00:45:34.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
between love and peace?

00:45:35.336 --> 00:45:38.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if so, what role does love play

00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:41.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
in achieving genuine peace?

00:45:42.802 --> 00:45:45.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible helps us to appreciate

00:45:45.471 --> 00:45:49.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
that love is an essential element

00:45:49.517 --> 00:45:52.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
in achieving genuine peace.

00:45:52.895 --> 00:45:56.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re interested in showing love.

00:45:58.568 --> 00:46:01.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
As students of the Bible, we know

00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:04.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans were created
in the image of God.

00:46:04.198 --> 00:46:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result,
you and I have the ability to show love.

00:46:10.246 --> 00:46:12.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also know that we live in a world

00:46:12.498 --> 00:46:15.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has a very distorted view

00:46:15.585 --> 00:46:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and definition of love.

00:46:18.087 --> 00:46:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
That, combined with our own imperfection,

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
means that if we’re not careful,

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
our view of love can become distorted.

00:46:28.306 --> 00:46:30.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we guard against that?

00:46:32.101 --> 00:46:36.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
By allowing Jehovah to teach us how to love.

00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:43.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you think about it,
what better teacher could we have?

00:46:43.196 --> 00:46:46.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that “God is love.”

00:46:46.908 --> 00:46:49.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that Jehovah, our Creator

00:46:49.702 --> 00:46:53.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
—who knows us better than we know ourselves,

00:46:53.414 --> 00:46:57.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
who embodies, who personifies love—

00:46:57.001 --> 00:47:01.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
is willing to teach us how to love.

00:47:01.214 --> 00:47:03.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how does he do that?

00:47:03.257 --> 00:47:07.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by means of his Word, the Bible,

00:47:07.136 --> 00:47:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by means of his own beautiful example.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we get acquainted with Jehovah,

00:47:13.393 --> 00:47:16.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn what love really is.

00:47:16.688 --> 00:47:20.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we put that love to work,

00:47:20.233 --> 00:47:22.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus did,

00:47:22.485 --> 00:47:25.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we’re in a position

00:47:25.154 --> 00:47:28.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy genuine peace.

00:47:29.283 --> 00:47:31.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium,

00:47:31.285 --> 00:47:35.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to explore how love for God,

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
love of neighbor,

00:47:37.542 --> 00:47:40.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love for God’s Word, the Bible,

00:47:40.336 --> 00:47:43.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to genuine peace.

00:47:43.881 --> 00:47:47.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s talk about love for God.

00:47:47.635 --> 00:47:50.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
How important is that

00:47:50.805 --> 00:47:54.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we want to enjoy genuine peace?

00:47:54.684 --> 00:47:58.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus provides some insight
in a statement he made

00:47:58.062 --> 00:48:01.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s recorded in our Bibles
at Matthew chapter 22.

00:48:01.315 --> 00:48:02.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at it.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 22,

00:48:04.736 --> 00:48:07.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verse 37.

00:48:09.407 --> 00:48:13.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to provide some context for these words,

00:48:13.953 --> 00:48:16.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus has been asked a question by a man

00:48:16.914 --> 00:48:19.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is well-versed in the Law.

00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:24.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[What] is the greatest commandment
in the Law?”

00:48:24.088 --> 00:48:27.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Jesus responds:

00:48:27.467 --> 00:48:29.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to him:

00:48:29.844 --> 00:48:33.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must love Jehovah your God

00:48:33.139 --> 00:48:35.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘with your whole heart

00:48:35.141 --> 00:48:37.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and with your whole soul

00:48:37.518 --> 00:48:40.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with your whole mind.’

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:44.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the greatest and first commandment.”

00:48:45.818 --> 00:48:50.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God”
—a command.

00:48:52.533 --> 00:48:54.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for Jehovah is essential.

00:48:54.994 --> 00:48:59.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be
the most important relationship in our life.

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
More important than any human,

00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:05.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
more important than any thing

00:49:05.129 --> 00:49:07.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we want to love Jehovah.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:09.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what extent?

00:49:09.383 --> 00:49:14.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus says: “with your whole heart.”

00:49:14.013 --> 00:49:16.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that involve?

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:19.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
The context of Jesus’ words

00:49:19.268 --> 00:49:24.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to understand that he was talking
about a person’s feelings,

00:49:24.023 --> 00:49:27.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotions, desires.

00:49:27.068 --> 00:49:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
So does love for God involve our emotions?

00:49:31.531 --> 00:49:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:49:33.783 --> 00:49:38.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it has to involve more
than a simple affection for God.

00:49:38.579 --> 00:49:40.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

00:49:40.206 --> 00:49:43.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Jesus say next?

00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With your whole soul,”

00:49:45.628 --> 00:49:48.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, with your entire being.

00:49:48.714 --> 00:49:51.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
We use everything we have

00:49:51.509 --> 00:49:53.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
to praise Jehovah

00:49:53.678 --> 00:49:56.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prove our love for him.

00:49:57.765 --> 00:50:00.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even more is involved.

00:50:00.226 --> 00:50:02.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus concludes by saying:

00:50:02.478 --> 00:50:05.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your whole mind.”

00:50:05.606 --> 00:50:09.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our intellectual faculties are involved.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re willing to take the time

00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to know Jehovah’s thinking

00:50:15.157 --> 00:50:17.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make it our thinking.

00:50:17.743 --> 00:50:20.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to think the way Jehovah thinks.

00:50:20.788 --> 00:50:23.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to understand his purpose

00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:27.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his requirements for us,

00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:30.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to understand his personality.

00:50:32.508 --> 00:50:37.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we think about that kind of love,

00:50:37.054 --> 00:50:40.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s clear that it encompasses

00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:45.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
our thoughts, our words, and our actions.

00:50:45.271 --> 00:50:48.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing is left out.

00:50:48.691 --> 00:50:51.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that kind of love

00:50:51.277 --> 00:50:55.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides a basis for a friendship with God.

00:50:56.699 --> 00:51:01.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that results in peace with God.

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:04.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there we see the progression.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loving Jehovah with our whole heart,

00:51:08.169 --> 00:51:11.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
soul, and mind

00:51:11.297 --> 00:51:14.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
leads to peace with God.

00:51:14.508 --> 00:51:17.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we enjoy peace with God,

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can also enjoy inner peace

00:51:20.222 --> 00:51:24.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace with those around us.

00:51:24.143 --> 00:51:26.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does that work?

00:51:26.395 --> 00:51:30.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our love for Jehovah
motivates us to imitate him,

00:51:30.942 --> 00:51:34.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we cultivate the qualities

00:51:34.779 --> 00:51:37.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah displays,

00:51:37.573 --> 00:51:40.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
for example: patience,

00:51:40.368 --> 00:51:44.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
kindness, mildness

00:51:44.038 --> 00:51:47.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities that make us attractive to others,

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:52.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and qualities that promote peace with others.

00:51:54.006 --> 00:51:56.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you would agree

00:51:56.133 --> 00:51:59.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we want to be at peace with God.

00:52:01.514 --> 00:52:05.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes our peace can be threatened.

00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:08.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience pressure.

00:52:08.813 --> 00:52:12.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may be the subject of some wrong,

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:17.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
some injustice, some evil

00:52:17.029 --> 00:52:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
that threatens our peace.

00:52:21.117 --> 00:52:23.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the question is this:

00:52:23.911 --> 00:52:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we handle things in a way

00:52:26.455 --> 00:52:29.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is pleasing to Jehovah

00:52:29.166 --> 00:52:31.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
or will we become impatient

00:52:31.335 --> 00:52:35.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
or try to take matters into our own hands?

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:38.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a family draws strength
from a Bible account

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
that highlights love and respect

00:52:46.642 --> 00:52:48.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:53:08.122 --> 00:53:09.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia!

00:53:10.332 --> 00:53:12.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia!

00:53:12.543 --> 00:53:15.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurry, you’re going to be late for school!

00:53:19.717 --> 00:53:20.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:53:20.593 --> 00:53:22.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, Mom. I’m going to preach.

00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:23.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you.

00:53:23.429 --> 00:53:23.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love you.

00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:25.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye, Mom. Love you.

00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have a good day.

00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:31.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, Mom.

00:53:39.195 --> 00:53:41.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:53:41.989 --> 00:53:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would never; she’s an angel.

00:53:44.075 --> 00:53:45.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all a front.

00:53:45.701 --> 00:53:46.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:53:46.952 --> 00:53:47.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:53:47.495 --> 00:53:49.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, she totally just saw us.

00:53:50.164 --> 00:53:52.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. I’m totally posting that.

00:53:52.166 --> 00:53:53.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it.

00:53:54.001 --> 00:53:54.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. It’s up.

00:53:55.586 --> 00:53:56.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone . . .

00:53:56.837 --> 00:53:57.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you just get that?

00:53:57.588 --> 00:53:58.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:53:58.297 --> 00:53:59.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:53:59.381 --> 00:54:00.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone . . .

00:54:00.132 --> 00:54:00.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the craziest.

00:54:00.925 --> 00:54:02.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness.

00:54:02.635 --> 00:54:04.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:08.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:54:08.974 --> 00:54:11.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:54:11.102 --> 00:54:12.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:14.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:54:14.897 --> 00:54:16.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:20.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all an act.

00:54:20.277 --> 00:54:22.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:54:22.113 --> 00:54:23.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, she saw us.

00:54:23.072 --> 00:54:24.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
She saw us.

00:54:24.115 --> 00:54:25.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t believe it.

00:54:25.157 --> 00:54:26.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to comment?

00:54:26.408 --> 00:54:27.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:54:29.328 --> 00:54:31.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even think she likes guys.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she’s into girls?

00:54:32.248 --> 00:54:33.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true. Yeah.

00:54:34.083 --> 00:54:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Comments!

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody is getting it.

00:54:36.919 --> 00:54:39.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bet she’s still a virgin.

00:54:52.476 --> 00:54:54.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, can I see that?

00:54:54.228 --> 00:54:55.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:54:57.022 --> 00:54:58.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:54:59.942 --> 00:55:01.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:02.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how are you going to do that?

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a very good question, actually.

00:55:04.321 --> 00:55:05.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, God promises . . .

00:55:05.114 --> 00:55:06.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no, not God, you!

00:55:06.824 --> 00:55:07.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:55:08.993 --> 00:55:11.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me? Well, I try to help others . . .

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try?

00:55:12.371 --> 00:55:13.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man, all you do
is stand next to your little cart

00:55:13.664 --> 00:55:16.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the rest of us
stand up for your rights, bro.

00:55:17.209 --> 00:55:19.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m actually neutral when it . . .

00:55:19.211 --> 00:55:19.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neutral?

00:55:19.837 --> 00:55:21.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ain’t no neutral. You’re just a coward.

00:55:23.591 --> 00:55:25.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:55:40.733 --> 00:55:42.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did it go?

00:55:42.401 --> 00:55:45.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a tough day at the cart, but I’m OK.

00:55:58.959 --> 00:55:59.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:56:01.629 --> 00:56:04.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:56:04.173 --> 00:56:05.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:56:05.883 --> 00:56:06.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia,

00:56:08.093 --> 00:56:10.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s wrong?

00:56:15.351 --> 00:56:17.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:56:17.478 --> 00:56:19.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:56:19.188 --> 00:56:21.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:56:21.982 --> 00:56:23.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:56:23.901 --> 00:56:25.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:56:25.486 --> 00:56:27.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:56:27.738 --> 00:56:30.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:56:30.115 --> 00:56:31.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all an act.

00:56:31.325 --> 00:56:33.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:56:33.535 --> 00:56:35.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, she saw us.

00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:41.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry that happened to you.

00:56:52.638 --> 00:56:54.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:58.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reminds me of a situation Paul was in.

00:57:04.108 --> 00:57:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it was at Acts chapter 16

00:57:11.073 --> 00:57:13.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 23:

00:57:15.744 --> 00:57:19.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After they had inflicted many blows on them,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they threw them into prison

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and ordered the jailer
to guard them securely.

00:57:31.093 --> 00:57:33.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because he got such an order, he threw them

00:57:33.804 --> 00:57:35.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into the inner prison

00:57:35.806 --> 00:57:38.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and fastened their feet in the stocks.

00:57:40.519 --> 00:57:43.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But about the middle of the night,

00:57:43.022 --> 00:57:45.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul and Silas were praying

00:57:45.107 --> 00:57:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and praising God with song,

00:57:48.277 --> 00:57:50.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prisoners were listening to them.”

00:57:53.073 --> 00:57:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think made them want to sing?

00:57:59.246 --> 00:58:00.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
They loved Jehovah.

00:58:00.998 --> 00:58:04.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when they focused on that,
how do you think they felt?

00:58:09.757 --> 00:58:10.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think

00:58:13.469 --> 00:58:15.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
they felt some peace.

00:58:15.512 --> 00:58:16.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about we dig a little bit deeper?

00:58:20.893 --> 00:58:21.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:58:21.602 --> 00:58:22.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:29.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did you notice?

00:58:30.819 --> 00:58:34.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe and Olivia are under pressure

00:58:34.823 --> 00:58:39.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Olivia in the classroom,
Gabe at the witnessing cart.

00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:44.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will they handle the pressure

00:58:44.124 --> 00:58:48.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that preserves
their peace with Jehovah?

00:58:49.463 --> 00:58:52.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a good question.

00:58:52.132 --> 00:58:54.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And really, all of us

00:58:54.927 --> 00:58:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to reflect on that question

00:58:57.721 --> 00:59:00.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re under pressure.

00:59:00.391 --> 00:59:03.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah’s way is the best way.

00:59:03.602 --> 00:59:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re convinced that his way of ruling
is the best way.

00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:13.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we’re subjected to pressure,

00:59:13.195 --> 00:59:17.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps the victim of some injustice

00:59:17.866 --> 00:59:20.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even of some evil,

00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may be inclined
to take matters into our own hands.

00:59:28.293 --> 00:59:31.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do,

00:59:31.296 --> 00:59:34.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can jeopardize our peace.

00:59:35.968 --> 00:59:40.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we demonstrate respect

00:59:40.222 --> 00:59:42.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s sovereignty?

00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:47.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspired advice
in Romans chapter 12 can help.

00:59:47.062 --> 00:59:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look together at Romans chapter 12,

00:59:50.399 --> 00:59:52.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning in verse 17:

00:59:56.071 --> 00:59:59.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return evil for evil to no one.”

00:59:59.741 --> 01:00:04.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this provides the context
for what follows.

01:00:04.746 --> 01:00:07.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may suffer some evil.

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:11.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return evil for evil to no one.

01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take into consideration what is fine
from the viewpoint of all men.”

01:00:16.008 --> 01:00:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then notice verse 18:

01:00:18.469 --> 01:00:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If possible, as far as it depends

01:00:21.513 --> 01:00:24.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on you,

01:00:24.057 --> 01:00:29.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
be peaceable (be a peacemaker)
with all men.”

01:00:30.898 --> 01:00:32.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these words

01:00:32.941 --> 01:00:36.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
really heighten our appreciation

01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:39.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s reasonableness.

01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:44.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah doesn’t ask us

01:00:44.453 --> 01:00:48.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something that we can’t do.

01:00:48.373 --> 01:00:52.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t ask us to control others.

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:54.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

01:00:55.255 --> 01:01:00.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the extent “it depends on you.”

01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:02.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah asks that each of us

01:01:02.888 --> 01:01:05.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
control ourselves,

01:01:05.474 --> 01:01:10.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
our response to a situation,

01:01:10.354 --> 01:01:12.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be peacemakers.

01:01:13.774 --> 01:01:18.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then an explanation, verse 19:

01:01:18.487 --> 01:01:22.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,

01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:24.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
but yield place to the wrath.”

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:25.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:29.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine;

01:01:29.414 --> 01:01:32.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will repay,’ says Jehovah.”

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:36.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the advice is this:

01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:38.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be a peacemaker,

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leave wrath to God.

01:01:41.093 --> 01:01:45.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let him determine
if and when and upon whom

01:01:45.722 --> 01:01:48.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
vengeance will be brought.

01:01:49.685 --> 01:01:51.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easy to say,

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:55.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is it always easy to do?

01:01:55.399 --> 01:01:57.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:01:57.401 --> 01:01:59.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
The example of King David

01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:03.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be very helpful to us.

01:02:03.073 --> 01:02:05.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through no fault of his own,

01:02:05.075 --> 01:02:08.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
David became the target

01:02:08.078 --> 01:02:12.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
of King Saul’s murderous hatred.

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:14.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on several occasions,

01:02:14.626 --> 01:02:17.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul tried to kill David.

01:02:17.963 --> 01:02:20.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
For several years David lived as a fugitive.

01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:24.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there were opportunities during that time

01:02:24.886 --> 01:02:29.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
for David to harm Saul, even to kill him.

01:02:30.976 --> 01:02:34.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have justified that in his mind.

01:02:34.896 --> 01:02:37.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you think had he done so

01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:41.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would have threatened his peace

01:02:41.403 --> 01:02:45.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his peace, especially, with Jehovah?

01:02:45.157 --> 01:02:48.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that it would.

01:02:48.368 --> 01:02:51.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did David respond?

01:02:51.371 --> 01:02:54.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion, he said to his men:

01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:58.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint

01:02:58.587 --> 01:03:01.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should do such a thing to my lord,

01:03:01.298 --> 01:03:03.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
the anointed of Jehovah.”

01:03:05.969 --> 01:03:08.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped David?

01:03:08.764 --> 01:03:11.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he saw a bigger picture

01:03:11.224 --> 01:03:14.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
than David and Saul, didn’t he?

01:03:14.603 --> 01:03:18.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw a picture with David, Saul,

01:03:18.023 --> 01:03:20.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah.

01:03:20.067 --> 01:03:23.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that if Saul needed to be corrected,

01:03:23.612 --> 01:03:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would do it in his time and way.

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:30.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, David was willing to be patient

01:03:30.702 --> 01:03:33.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he preserved his peace

01:03:33.288 --> 01:03:37.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his peace with God, his inner peace,

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:40.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his peace with those around him.

01:03:40.003 --> 01:03:42.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful example!

01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:45.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure that if we demonstrate

01:03:45.926 --> 01:03:48.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for Jehovah

01:03:48.095 --> 01:03:52.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
by respecting his sovereignty
and waiting on him,

01:03:52.974 --> 01:03:56.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy peace as well.

01:03:57.437 --> 01:03:59.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assures us

01:03:59.439 --> 01:04:02.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will bless his people

01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:05.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will bless us with peace.

01:04:05.904 --> 01:04:08.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us be determined to love Jehovah

01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:12.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our whole heart, soul, and mind

01:04:12.244 --> 01:04:15.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to demonstrate our love for Jehovah

01:04:15.372 --> 01:04:20.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
by patiently waiting on him
and respecting his sovereignty

01:04:20.001 --> 01:04:22.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his way of doing things.

01:04:22.045 --> 01:04:24.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we will enjoy

01:04:24.256 --> 01:04:27.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
the incomparable peace of God.

01:04:28.844 --> 01:04:32.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

01:04:32.973 --> 01:04:36.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Love Leads to Genuine Peace
—Love of Neighbor.”

01:04:49.656 --> 01:04:53.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Foretelling dominant traits
that would exist in the last days,

01:04:53.326 --> 01:04:57.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Timothy chapter 3 says
that “men will be lovers of themselves.”

01:04:58.957 --> 01:05:02.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it wrong for us to love ourselves?

01:05:02.544 --> 01:05:07.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it’s normal, even necessary,
to have a healthy love of oneself.

01:05:07.507 --> 01:05:10.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, Jesus said:

01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:14.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love your neighbor as yourself.”

01:05:15.307 --> 01:05:18.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll talk more about that in a minute.

01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:20.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the love mentioned here

01:05:20.854 --> 01:05:24.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
is distorted and selfish.

01:05:24.065 --> 01:05:26.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because it prevents love of neighbor,

01:05:26.985 --> 01:05:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes a barrier to peace.

01:05:30.864 --> 01:05:35.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some Bible scholars suggest that Paul
put love of self at the top of his list

01:05:35.827 --> 01:05:38.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:1-5

01:05:38.872 --> 01:05:42.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all the remaining
negative characteristics in the list

01:05:42.542 --> 01:05:44.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
result from it.

01:05:44.544 --> 01:05:48.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those traits too are a barrier to peace.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
“not [being] open to any agreement”

01:05:51.635 --> 01:05:55.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at 2 Timothy 3:3,

01:05:55.388 --> 01:05:58.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
often leads to “anger, wrath,

01:05:58.475 --> 01:06:02.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
screaming, and abusive speech.”

01:06:02.187 --> 01:06:04.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than bringing peace,

01:06:04.356 --> 01:06:08.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
such a lack of self-control
“stirs up strife.”

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, love of neighbor

01:06:11.279 --> 01:06:14.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the opposite effect.

01:06:14.407 --> 01:06:17.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
It leads to genuine peace.

01:06:19.079 --> 01:06:23.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Matthew chapter 22,

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:26.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 36.

01:06:26.086 --> 01:06:29.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the Pharisees versed in the Law

01:06:29.923 --> 01:06:32.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
tests Jesus:

01:06:32.843 --> 01:06:35.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Teacher,

01:06:35.011 --> 01:06:39.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the greatest commandment
in the Law?”

01:06:40.183 --> 01:06:43.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus responded with the words in verse 37

01:06:43.228 --> 01:06:47.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
just considered at length
in the preceding talk:

01:06:47.232 --> 01:06:51.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God.”

01:06:51.736 --> 01:06:54.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, Jesus goes
beyond the original question

01:06:54.906 --> 01:06:56.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and quotes a second commandment.

01:06:56.741 --> 01:06:59.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 39:

01:06:59.786 --> 01:07:02.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The second, like it, is this:

01:07:02.706 --> 01:07:06.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’”

01:07:08.211 --> 01:07:11.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is saying that the two commandments

01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:14.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love of God and love of neighbor—

01:07:14.467 --> 01:07:16.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
are linked.

01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:21.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how exactly would you define “neighbor”?

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:24.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Luke chapter 10.

01:07:25.854 --> 01:07:29.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Jesus answered this very question:

01:07:29.566 --> 01:07:32.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who really is my neighbor?”

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus responds clearly
with his renowned illustration

01:07:35.488 --> 01:07:37.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the neighborly Samaritan.

01:07:37.782 --> 01:07:41.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ day, the Jews disdained Samaritans.

01:07:41.661 --> 01:07:46.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their attitude moved Jesus
to make a powerful point.

01:07:46.374 --> 01:07:49.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his illustration,
Jesus said that the Samaritan

01:07:49.586 --> 01:07:53.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
took extraordinary measures
to help a Jewish man.

01:07:53.715 --> 01:07:56.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jew had fallen victim to robbers,

01:07:56.635 --> 01:07:59.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his own countrymen ignored him

01:07:59.721 --> 01:08:02.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
—leaving him half-dead.

01:08:02.265 --> 01:08:06.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Jesus said
must have stunned the audience.

01:08:06.311 --> 01:08:10.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 10:33, 34 reads:

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:14.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But a certain Samaritan

01:08:14.694 --> 01:08:17.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“traveling the road came upon him,

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.

01:08:21.534 --> 01:08:24.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he approached him
and bandaged his wounds,

01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:27.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pouring oil and wine on them.

01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:32.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he mounted him on his own animal
and brought him to an inn

01:08:32.754 --> 01:08:35.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took care of him.”

01:08:35.465 --> 01:08:40.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus then asked a penetrating question
in verse 36:

01:08:41.137 --> 01:08:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who of these three

01:08:43.139 --> 01:08:46.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to you
to have made himself neighbor?”

01:08:48.144 --> 01:08:50.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words recorded in verse 37

01:08:50.146 --> 01:08:53.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
are also directed to you and to me:

01:08:54.901 --> 01:08:57.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go and do the same yourself.”

01:08:59.531 --> 01:09:01.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our neighbors include

01:09:01.616 --> 01:09:05.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only our family members
and our Christian brothers and sisters

01:09:05.245 --> 01:09:09.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all whom we encounter from day to day.

01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:11.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, our love

01:09:11.918 --> 01:09:15.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
extends to those who are not of our own race,

01:09:15.505 --> 01:09:19.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
tribe, nationality, or religion.

01:09:19.634 --> 01:09:22.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we show that love?

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Romans chapter 13.

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:31.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we love our neighbor,

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:36.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
we avoid conduct that disrupts peace.

01:09:37.277 --> 01:09:39.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we strive to apply
the inspired counsel

01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:44.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 13:8-10:

01:09:46.202 --> 01:09:51.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not owe anything to anyone
except to love one another;

01:09:51.082 --> 01:09:54.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for whoever loves his fellow man
has fulfilled the law.

01:09:54.961 --> 01:09:58.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the law code,
‘You must not commit adultery,

01:09:58.173 --> 01:10:01.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you must not murder,
you must not steal, you must not covet,’

01:10:01.426 --> 01:10:04.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and whatever other commandment there is,

01:10:04.512 --> 01:10:07.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is summed up in this saying:

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’

01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:14.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor;

01:10:14.981 --> 01:10:18.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
therefore, love is the law’s fulfillment.”

01:10:20.028 --> 01:10:23.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that our responsibility
is to treat others

01:10:23.198 --> 01:10:25.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that promote peace.

01:10:25.742 --> 01:10:28.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
When others treat us unkindly,

01:10:28.036 --> 01:10:30.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endeavor to imitate Jesus.

01:10:30.997 --> 01:10:35.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was being insulted,
he did not return the insult.

01:10:35.752 --> 01:10:39.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was suffering,
he didn’t go threatening.

01:10:39.172 --> 01:10:42.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitating the Prince of Peace
and the God of peace

01:10:42.842 --> 01:10:45.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us inner peace.

01:10:47.263 --> 01:10:49.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:10:49.265 --> 01:10:52.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a family benefits
from the apostle Paul’s example

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:54.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
of displaying love of neighbor,

01:10:54.354 --> 01:10:56.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when provoked.

01:10:58.358 --> 01:10:59.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to do?

01:10:59.359 --> 01:10:59.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

01:10:59.984 --> 01:11:01.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man, all you do
is stand next to your little cart.

01:11:01.486 --> 01:11:02.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t do anything.

01:11:02.237 --> 01:11:02.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

01:11:02.862 --> 01:11:03.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just stand next to your little cart.

01:11:03.613 --> 01:11:03.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

01:11:03.947 --> 01:11:04.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ain’t no neutral.

01:11:04.656 --> 01:11:05.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stand up for your rights.

01:11:05.365 --> 01:11:06.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

01:11:06.491 --> 01:11:07.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe,

01:11:07.826 --> 01:11:09.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened today?

01:11:13.164 --> 01:11:16.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just that I’ve been yelled at
in service before, but

01:11:17.335 --> 01:11:20.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time I wanted to—I don’t know.

01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:25.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to go up to the girls
and smash their phones.

01:11:26.636 --> 01:11:28.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so glad that you didn’t.

01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:31.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:34.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel guilty

01:11:34.727 --> 01:11:37.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was like—I was like so angry.

01:11:43.027 --> 01:11:44.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

01:11:46.114 --> 01:11:48.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep reading.

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:51.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had left off in verse 26.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Suddenly a great earthquake occurred,

01:12:00.044 --> 01:12:03.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the foundations of the jail
were shaken.

01:12:03.256 --> 01:12:07.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, all the doors
were instantly opened,

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:09.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and everyone’s bonds came loose.

01:12:09.554 --> 01:12:13.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the jailer woke up
and saw that the prison doors were open,

01:12:13.933 --> 01:12:15.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he drew his sword

01:12:15.977 --> 01:12:18.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and was about to kill himself,

01:12:18.062 --> 01:12:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“assuming that the prisoners had escaped.

01:12:21.524 --> 01:12:24.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Paul called out with a loud voice:

01:12:24.068 --> 01:12:26.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here!’

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he asked for lights and rushed in,

01:12:31.868 --> 01:12:34.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and seized with trembling,

01:12:34.078 --> 01:12:36.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fell down before Paul and Silas.”

01:12:40.627 --> 01:12:43.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about what the jailer
had done to Paul.

01:12:49.093 --> 01:12:50.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have hated him for it.

01:12:50.678 --> 01:12:52.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he could have.

01:12:53.973 --> 01:12:58.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess he saw the jailer’s pain
instead of just his own.

01:13:04.067 --> 01:13:06.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, Paul loved his neighbor.

01:13:06.194 --> 01:13:09.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t hold back
from trying to save his life.

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:21.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, man.

01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:30.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, how do you have the nerve
to keep coming out here?

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, you were right

01:13:34.305 --> 01:13:36.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what you said.

01:13:36.391 --> 01:13:40.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one should stand around
while other people suffer injustice.

01:13:40.186 --> 01:13:42.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do something. Fight like we do.

01:13:43.022 --> 01:13:45.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my way of making a difference

01:13:45.024 --> 01:13:48.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the only way that I know
the world can really change.

01:13:48.319 --> 01:13:50.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, man, the Bible?

01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:54.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I get what you’re thinking,
but let me show you just one scripture.

01:13:55.076 --> 01:13:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, one scripture.

01:13:56.744 --> 01:13:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is a verse in the Bible
that convinced me

01:13:59.038 --> 01:14:01.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how I can make a difference.

01:14:01.082 --> 01:14:04.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at Matthew 24:14.

01:14:04.877 --> 01:14:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here it says:

01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom
will be preached

01:14:09.632 --> 01:14:11.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all the inhabited earth

01:14:11.884 --> 01:14:14.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

01:14:14.137 --> 01:14:16.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the end will come.”

01:14:21.227 --> 01:14:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the dramatization, Paul could have reacted

01:14:24.605 --> 01:14:27.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a negative way toward the jailer.

01:14:27.608 --> 01:14:31.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in spite of the way
he had been treated,

01:14:31.279 --> 01:14:34.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
he displayed neighborly love.

01:14:34.324 --> 01:14:36.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this had a powerful effect on the jailer

01:14:36.784 --> 01:14:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brought praise to Jehovah.

01:14:40.371 --> 01:14:43.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we are imperfect,

01:14:43.416 --> 01:14:48.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must work hard
at cultivating love for our neighbor.

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:53.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is illustrated in what happened
with the apostle Peter.

01:14:53.176 --> 01:14:56.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to becoming a follower of Jesus,

01:14:56.679 --> 01:15:00.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did not have fellowship
with non-Jewish people.

01:15:00.558 --> 01:15:03.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after he became a Christian,

01:15:03.186 --> 01:15:05.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
God taught him

01:15:05.188 --> 01:15:08.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
that division between Jews and Gentiles

01:15:08.566 --> 01:15:10.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not to continue,

01:15:10.777 --> 01:15:13.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Peter got the point.

01:15:13.363 --> 01:15:16.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 10:34, 35,

01:15:16.657 --> 01:15:19.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter is quoted as saying:

01:15:19.452 --> 01:15:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I truly understand
that God is not partial,

01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:28.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in every nation the man who fears him
and does what is right

01:15:28.836 --> 01:15:32.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
is acceptable to him.”

01:15:32.131 --> 01:15:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter even stayed in the newly converted
Gentiles’ home for days.

01:15:36.886 --> 01:15:39.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he continued the practice of eating

01:15:39.764 --> 01:15:43.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
with non-Jewish Christians.

01:15:43.142 --> 01:15:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, 13 years later

01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:48.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
while in Syrian Antioch,

01:15:48.773 --> 01:15:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter suddenly stopped associating
with Gentile Christians.

01:15:52.568 --> 01:15:54.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:15:54.445 --> 01:15:56.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
He feared the reaction
of some Jewish Christians

01:15:56.781 --> 01:15:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were slow to accept change.

01:15:59.575 --> 01:16:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
This illustrates that prejudice
can be deeply rooted.

01:16:04.038 --> 01:16:07.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes constant effort
to rid ourselves of it.

01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:11.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we must learn to view others impartially

01:16:11.754 --> 01:16:14.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah does.

01:16:14.132 --> 01:16:17.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to treat others
as Jehovah treats them.

01:16:18.344 --> 01:16:22.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:

01:16:22.098 --> 01:16:24.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You heard that it was said:

01:16:24.642 --> 01:16:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must love your neighbor
and hate your enemy.’

01:16:28.771 --> 01:16:32.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, I say to you:

01:16:32.442 --> 01:16:34.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue to love your enemies

01:16:34.569 --> 01:16:38.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to pray for those who persecute you.”

01:16:38.489 --> 01:16:42.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, as recorded at Matthew chapter 5,

01:16:42.326 --> 01:16:45.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 45,

01:16:45.121 --> 01:16:48.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
he explains why we want to show
that type of love:

01:16:49.834 --> 01:16:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that you may prove yourselves
sons of your Father who is in the heavens,

01:16:54.505 --> 01:16:58.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“since he makes his sun rise
on both the wicked and the good

01:16:58.217 --> 01:17:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and makes it rain on both the righteous

01:17:01.304 --> 01:17:03.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the unrighteous.”

01:17:03.848 --> 01:17:06.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
This love produced by holy spirit

01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:11.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
is markedly different from the sort of love
that is common in the world.

01:17:11.856 --> 01:17:15.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s based on a higher principle.

01:17:15.026 --> 01:17:19.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said even sinners
will follow a policy of like for like.

01:17:20.823 --> 01:17:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we want to prove ourselves
sons of our “Father who is in the heavens,”

01:17:25.828 --> 01:17:28.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be different.

01:17:28.164 --> 01:17:30.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
We welcome others

01:17:30.958 --> 01:17:34.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
as God and Christ have welcomed us.

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Romans 15:7, the Bible says to us:

01:17:38.341 --> 01:17:40.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Welcome one another,

01:17:40.718 --> 01:17:44.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Christ also welcomed you.”

01:17:44.889 --> 01:17:47.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word used there conveys the idea

01:17:47.308 --> 01:17:50.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
of receiving someone kindly or hospitably

01:17:50.353 --> 01:17:53.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
—such as into one’s home
or circle of friends.

01:17:54.899 --> 01:17:58.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prejudice withers as love grows.

01:17:59.987 --> 01:18:02.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that at one time,

01:18:02.448 --> 01:18:07.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were all strangers, or foreigners,
not close to God.

01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:11.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah drew us to him

01:18:11.249 --> 01:18:13.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
with “cords of love.”

01:18:13.834 --> 01:18:17.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ welcomed us.

01:18:17.088 --> 01:18:21.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
He opened the door, as it were,
so that we could become part of God’s family.

01:18:22.552 --> 01:18:26.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jesus has kindly accepted us

01:18:26.264 --> 01:18:28.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
as imperfect as we are,

01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:33.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
it should be unthinkable for us
to reject anyone else.

01:18:33.688 --> 01:18:35.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:40.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
divisions, prejudice, and hostility
will doubtless increase in the world

01:18:40.486 --> 01:18:44.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we approach the end of this wicked system.

01:18:44.323 --> 01:18:47.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
As servants of Jehovah, though,

01:18:47.159 --> 01:18:51.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
we seek “the wisdom from above,”
which is impartial

01:18:51.372 --> 01:18:53.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and promotes peace.

01:18:53.874 --> 01:18:56.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice

01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:59.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we forge friendships
with people from other lands,

01:18:59.505 --> 01:19:01.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
accept cultural differences,

01:19:01.507 --> 01:19:05.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and possibly even learn
the languages of others.

01:19:05.428 --> 01:19:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do this,

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:10.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace flows “just like a river”

01:19:10.808 --> 01:19:14.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and justice “like the waves of the sea.”

01:19:14.645 --> 01:19:18.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We “work what is good toward all,

01:19:18.107 --> 01:19:21.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially [our brothers].”

01:19:21.027 --> 01:19:25.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love of neighbor moves us
to make sacrifices in behalf of others

01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:28.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to share the good news
at every opportunity.

01:19:29.619 --> 01:19:34.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Master, Jesus, said:

01:19:34.248 --> 01:19:37.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my commandment,

01:19:37.084 --> 01:19:41.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you love one another
just as I have loved you.”

01:19:42.882 --> 01:19:47.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are the blessings
that come from love of neighbor?

01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:49.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus answers that

01:19:49.597 --> 01:19:52.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John chapter 15,

01:19:52.683 --> 01:19:55.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verses 8 through 10,

01:19:58.981 --> 01:20:00.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning with verse 8.

01:20:02.443 --> 01:20:04.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

01:20:04.445 --> 01:20:08.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My father is glorified in this,

01:20:08.658 --> 01:20:11.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you keep bearing much fruit

01:20:11.702 --> 01:20:14.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prove yourselves my disciples.”

01:20:15.706 --> 01:20:20.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second blessing, verse 9:

01:20:20.127 --> 01:20:24.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as the Father has loved me,
so I have loved you;

01:20:24.256 --> 01:20:26.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remain in my love.

01:20:26.967 --> 01:20:29.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you observe my commandments,

01:20:29.887 --> 01:20:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will remain in my love,

01:20:32.682 --> 01:20:35.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as I have observed
the commandments of the Father

01:20:35.976 --> 01:20:38.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain in his love.”

01:20:40.606 --> 01:20:44.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

01:20:44.068 --> 01:20:46.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the final talk
of this symposium,

01:20:46.904 --> 01:20:51.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Love Leads to Genuine Peace
—Love for God’s Word.”

01:20:59.625 --> 01:21:04.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine a collection
of some 40 million books?

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would fill more than 800 miles,

01:21:06.549 --> 01:21:09.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 1,300 kilometers, of bookshelves?

01:21:09.552 --> 01:21:12.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, that is what you can find
in what has been described

01:21:12.513 --> 01:21:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the largest library in the world

01:21:15.725 --> 01:21:18.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.,

01:21:18.686 --> 01:21:20.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States.

01:21:20.855 --> 01:21:24.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which book would you say
is the most worthwhile to read

01:21:24.316 --> 01:21:26.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
among all of those millions of volumes?

01:21:26.944 --> 01:21:29.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can let the apostle Paul
answer that question.

01:21:29.989 --> 01:21:33.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his second letter to Timothy
at 2 Timothy 3:15,

01:21:33.701 --> 01:21:37.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
he referred to “the holy writings,
which are able to make [us]

01:21:37.204 --> 01:21:41.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
wise for salvation
through faith in Christ Jesus.”

01:21:41.751 --> 01:21:45.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was referring, of course,
to God’s own written Word

01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:48.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we know as the Bible.

01:21:48.215 --> 01:21:52.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
The contents of this book can give us
the wisdom that we need to gain salvation,

01:21:52.803 --> 01:21:56.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that makes it
the most worthwhile book on earth.

01:21:57.725 --> 01:22:01.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can a book have
such a profound effect on a person?

01:22:02.104 --> 01:22:05.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when describing books
and their authors per se,

01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:08.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
the secular writer Gilbert Highet once stated

01:22:08.235 --> 01:22:11.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
that books are not “lumps of lifeless paper,

01:22:11.322 --> 01:22:14.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but minds alive on the shelves.

01:22:14.658 --> 01:22:16.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From each of them goes out
its own voice . . .

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:20.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So by taking down one of these volumes
and opening it,

01:22:20.122 --> 01:22:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one can call into range
the voice of a man the author,

01:22:23.626 --> 01:22:25.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
“far distant in time and space,

01:22:25.961 --> 01:22:30.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hear him speaking to us,
mind to mind, heart to heart.”

01:22:30.966 --> 01:22:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we take this book, the Bible,
down off the shelf and open it,

01:22:35.805 --> 01:22:40.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are calling into range
the voice of its Author, Jehovah.

01:22:40.267 --> 01:22:44.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
And is he speaking to us
mind to mind, heart to heart?

01:22:44.647 --> 01:22:46.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, he is.

01:22:46.649 --> 01:22:51.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, at Jeremiah 29:11,
Jehovah tells us:

01:22:51.195 --> 01:22:55.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you, . . .

01:22:55.324 --> 01:22:57.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

01:22:57.785 --> 01:23:00.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give you a future and a hope.”

01:23:00.246 --> 01:23:03.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at Proverbs 27:11, Jehovah tells us:

01:23:03.707 --> 01:23:06.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be wise . . . and make my heart rejoice,

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:11.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can make a reply
to him who taunts me.”

01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:14.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
How grateful we are
that Jehovah has given us

01:23:14.009 --> 01:23:16.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
his precious Word, the Bible,

01:23:16.428 --> 01:23:19.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reveals his intimate thoughts
and feelings,

01:23:19.431 --> 01:23:21.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
that draws us close to him,

01:23:21.433 --> 01:23:25.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that teaches us
how to gain everlasting life!

01:23:25.479 --> 01:23:29.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we love Jehovah,
we also love and cherish

01:23:29.066 --> 01:23:33.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he tells us
through the pages of his written Word.

01:23:33.404 --> 01:23:36.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is exactly how the psalmist felt

01:23:36.031 --> 01:23:38.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wrote the 119th Psalm.

01:23:38.659 --> 01:23:42.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible to Psalm 119,

01:23:42.872 --> 01:23:45.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find verse 161.

01:23:45.457 --> 01:23:49.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Psalm 119:161.

01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:52.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the latter part, it says:

01:23:52.923 --> 01:23:57.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But my heart stands in awe of your words.”

01:23:57.511 --> 01:24:02.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now see what more he wrote
in verses 167 and 168:

01:24:03.559 --> 01:24:07.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I keep your reminders,
and I love them dearly.

01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:10.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I observe your orders and your reminders,

01:24:10.524 --> 01:24:14.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you are aware of all that I do.”

01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:19.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible writer did not view
God’s orders and reminders

01:24:19.033 --> 01:24:23.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
as just a list of cold, legalistic statutes.

01:24:23.913 --> 01:24:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be sure
that he did not consider them

01:24:26.582 --> 01:24:28.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be burdensome.

01:24:28.584 --> 01:24:31.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he knew that they formed the basis

01:24:31.754 --> 01:24:34.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the best life possible.

01:24:34.173 --> 01:24:37.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is why he not only wanted
to learn God’s orders,

01:24:37.927 --> 01:24:41.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also desired to observe,
or obey, them.

01:24:42.765 --> 01:24:47.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist believed that God’s Word
is the one thing worth studying,

01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:51.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that because of knowing
God’s orders and reminders,

01:24:51.023 --> 01:24:53.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are far wiser than people

01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:57.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
who know everything else
except God’s Word.

01:24:57.112 --> 01:25:04.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now look at what more he wrote in verse 165:

01:25:04.036 --> 01:25:08.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abundant peace
belongs to those who love your law;

01:25:08.415 --> 01:25:12.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
nothing can make them stumble.”

01:25:12.044 --> 01:25:16.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herein lies a major reason
why we love God’s Word:

01:25:16.507 --> 01:25:20.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abiding by it leads to genuine peace.

01:25:20.469 --> 01:25:22.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone longs for peace in their life,

01:25:22.888 --> 01:25:27.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and through the pages of the Bible,
we learn how to attain it.

01:25:27.559 --> 01:25:30.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we choose to live by God’s Word

01:25:30.646 --> 01:25:33.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the face of the trials
that arise in our life

01:25:33.774 --> 01:25:38.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of which may try to steal away
our peace of mind and heart.

01:25:38.445 --> 01:25:42.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, Jehovah knows what we
are going through every day of our lives

01:25:42.282 --> 01:25:44.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stands ready to help us.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we love and obey Jehovah’s Word,

01:25:48.706 --> 01:25:53.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not be stumbled spiritually
by what someone else does or says

01:25:53.544 --> 01:25:56.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or by any other matter or situation in life.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does love for God’s Word
lead to such peace

01:26:01.135 --> 01:26:04.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep us from stumbling?

01:26:04.388 --> 01:26:06.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
that “all scripture is inspired of God,”

01:26:06.932 --> 01:26:11.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the Bible the most reliable guide
for every aspect of life.

01:26:11.603 --> 01:26:16.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, his wisdom
is infinitely superior to our own.

01:26:16.316 --> 01:26:18.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading the Bible enables us
to look at matters

01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:21.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
from God’s elevated point of view.

01:26:21.864 --> 01:26:25.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is just as the prophet Isaiah wrote

01:26:25.534 --> 01:26:29.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 55:8, 9.

01:26:29.038 --> 01:26:31.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d like to open to that, please

01:26:31.248 --> 01:26:34.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 55:8, 9.

01:26:36.128 --> 01:26:40.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote: “‘For my thoughts
are not your thoughts,

01:26:40.299 --> 01:26:44.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your ways are not my ways,’
declares Jehovah.

01:26:44.678 --> 01:26:46.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For as the heavens
are higher than the earth,

01:26:46.930 --> 01:26:49.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so my ways are higher than your ways

01:26:49.767 --> 01:26:52.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my thoughts than your thoughts.’”

01:26:53.979 --> 01:26:57.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just imagine
—Jehovah’s thoughts and language

01:26:57.274 --> 01:27:01.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be vastly superior to those of humans.

01:27:01.361 --> 01:27:04.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he communicates with us,
as he does through the pages of the Bible,

01:27:04.865 --> 01:27:08.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts

01:27:08.702 --> 01:27:11.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can understand them.

01:27:11.121 --> 01:27:13.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then as we take in all that Jehovah says,

01:27:13.832 --> 01:27:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can let his thinking guide our thinking.

01:27:18.378 --> 01:27:22.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading the Bible
can be likened to peering into a mirror

01:27:22.424 --> 01:27:25.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
because its message
has the power to allow us

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see ourselves as we really are

01:27:28.222 --> 01:27:30.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it shows us where adjustments
are needed

01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:32.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our attitude and conduct.

01:27:34.937 --> 01:27:38.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus far in this symposium,
we have seen how this can actually work.

01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:41.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have seen two dramatizations
of a widowed mother

01:27:41.944 --> 01:27:46.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the Bible to help her teenage children
avoid being stumbled

01:27:46.031 --> 01:27:49.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
by other young people
who had been harassing them.

01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, her son, Gabe,
had been called a coward

01:27:53.122 --> 01:27:55.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a couple of tough-looking youths

01:27:55.374 --> 01:27:58.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
while he was engaged in public witnessing.

01:27:58.252 --> 01:28:01.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And her daughter, Olivia,
had been chided by other girls

01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
for not being interested in dating
one of the guys in her class.

01:28:06.385 --> 01:28:11.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their mother used what Jehovah inspired
the apostle Paul to write about

01:28:11.098 --> 01:28:13.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his ordeal in prison

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:17.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show how he was able
to preserve his peace

01:28:17.104 --> 01:28:19.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very difficult situation.

01:28:19.731 --> 01:28:24.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that, in turn, helped Olivia and Gabe
to safeguard their own peace.

01:28:25.779 --> 01:28:29.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what more the mother finds
in the Bible to help Olivia

01:28:29.783 --> 01:28:34.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
avoid being stumbled into conduct
that could rob her of peace.

01:28:35.956 --> 01:28:37.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:38.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

01:28:38.458 --> 01:28:39.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:40.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she ever?

01:28:40.377 --> 01:28:40.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

01:28:40.919 --> 01:28:42.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even think she likes guys.

01:28:42.588 --> 01:28:43.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she’s into girls?

01:28:43.463 --> 01:28:45.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bet she’s still a virgin.

01:28:47.634 --> 01:28:49.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia, what are you thinking?

01:28:52.181 --> 01:28:55.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t—I don’t know how they could do that.

01:28:55.642 --> 01:28:57.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even follow them.

01:28:58.395 --> 01:29:00.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this doesn’t stop,

01:29:02.774 --> 01:29:04.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if I can . . .

01:29:07.654 --> 01:29:09.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re strong, OK.

01:29:09.948 --> 01:29:11.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just can’t let them get to you.

01:29:18.373 --> 01:29:20.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels out of your control, doesn’t it?

01:29:33.096 --> 01:29:36.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, I think we need another Bible example.

01:29:37.768 --> 01:29:40.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when we studied
about the Shulammite girl?

01:29:44.775 --> 01:29:46.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I remember.

01:29:47.152 --> 01:29:49.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who was pressuring her?

01:29:52.491 --> 01:29:54.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon.

01:29:59.206 --> 01:30:02.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she wasn’t interested in him,

01:30:02.459 --> 01:30:06.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like I’m not interested
in that boy Jake, so . . .

01:30:07.547 --> 01:30:09.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it wasn’t just him;

01:30:09.508 --> 01:30:13.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were the daughters of Jerusalem
in Solomon’s court.

01:30:15.639 --> 01:30:18.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
They urged her to accept his attentions.

01:30:20.978 --> 01:30:23.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you remember what she said

01:30:23.814 --> 01:30:26.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Song of Solomon chapter 2?

01:30:29.236 --> 01:30:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “I put you under oath,

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O daughters of Jerusalem,

01:30:33.407 --> 01:30:36.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the gazelles and the does of the field:

01:30:36.159 --> 01:30:40.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me

01:30:40.038 --> 01:30:42.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it feels inclined.”

01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
So despite all of the pressure,
who was really in control?

01:30:49.965 --> 01:30:52.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was.

01:30:53.302 --> 01:30:57.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one was going to push her
into something that she didn’t want to do.

01:31:00.434 --> 01:31:04.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
She even said: “I am a wall.”

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the same power.

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:15.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you believe that,
it’ll change how you handle the pressure.

01:31:18.785 --> 01:31:20.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now give me a hug.

01:31:32.424 --> 01:31:35.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, update on yesterday’s topic.

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess she still needs a man.

01:31:37.095 --> 01:31:38.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
She needs something.

01:31:43.810 --> 01:31:45.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just posted it. Go like my video.

01:31:47.481 --> 01:31:50.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
All they want is to see me give in.

01:31:51.234 --> 01:31:54.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, update on yesterday’s topic.
I guess she still needs . . .

01:31:55.447 --> 01:31:58.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would I give them the satisfaction?

01:31:59.117 --> 01:32:01.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

01:32:03.205 --> 01:32:05.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can make me stumble.

01:32:10.670 --> 01:32:12.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a wall.”

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia’s mother thought
of another inspired Bible example,

01:32:29.856 --> 01:32:32.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of the Shulammite girl
who was being urged

01:32:32.776 --> 01:32:37.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the young women in Solomon’s court
to accept his amorous attentions.

01:32:37.322 --> 01:32:41.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
But despite the pressure,
the Shulammite girl remained in control

01:32:41.284 --> 01:32:45.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
for no one was going to push her
into something that she did not want to do.

01:32:45.956 --> 01:32:49.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia got the point
as she thought to herself:

01:32:49.751 --> 01:32:52.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My peace comes from doing the right thing.

01:32:52.254 --> 01:32:55.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can make me stumble. I am a wall.’

01:32:57.092 --> 01:33:01.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s obvious that the mother
had a real love for God’s Word, knew it well,

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:06.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and calmly and skillfully used it
to guide the thinking of her children

01:33:06.393 --> 01:33:09.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep them from stumbling.

01:33:10.564 --> 01:33:13.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many people these days
put God’s Word out of their mind

01:33:13.942 --> 01:33:16.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent it from influencing their life.

01:33:16.903 --> 01:33:20.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as the world’s morals decline,
we must stick loyally to God’s Word

01:33:20.907 --> 01:33:24.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
to conform our conduct
to his pure and holy thinking

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:28.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthen our determination
to live by his standards.

01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:34.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is just what the apostle Paul
urged us to do

01:33:34.171 --> 01:33:37.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 12:2.

01:33:37.257 --> 01:33:41.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you would turn there, please
—Romans 12:2.

01:33:42.554 --> 01:33:44.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote:

01:33:44.556 --> 01:33:48.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And stop being molded
by this system of things,

01:33:48.143 --> 01:33:51.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but be transformed
by making your mind over,

01:33:51.855 --> 01:33:56.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may prove to yourselves
the good and acceptable

01:33:56.485 --> 01:33:59.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perfect will of God.”

01:33:59.446 --> 01:34:03.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word strengthens us
to resist conforming

01:34:03.033 --> 01:34:05.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the corrupting practices of Satan’s world

01:34:05.368 --> 01:34:08.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to suppress temptations
toward wrongdoing.

01:34:09.915 --> 01:34:12.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we prove to ourselves

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the will of God is good and perfect,

01:34:15.295 --> 01:34:17.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we should also accept

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
that loyally obeying God
is the best way of living.

01:34:20.842 --> 01:34:24.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a direct connection
between heeding Scriptural teachings

01:34:24.304 --> 01:34:28.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obeying or enjoying genuine peace.

01:34:29.559 --> 01:34:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, for Jehovah’s Word
to have such power in our lives,

01:34:33.396 --> 01:34:36.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to read the Bible every day

01:34:36.441 --> 01:34:40.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditate on why its counsel
is beneficial.

01:34:40.445 --> 01:34:42.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means reading it at a pace

01:34:42.656 --> 01:34:46.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
that allows us to ponder
on what we are reading.

01:34:46.785 --> 01:34:49.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing this helps to fix in our minds
the portions

01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:52.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are especially helpful to us.

01:34:52.749 --> 01:34:56.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
When asked why he reads the Bible
every day,

01:34:56.962 --> 01:34:59.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
one Christian replied:

01:34:59.047 --> 01:35:01.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I repeatedly pray to Jehovah
during the day

01:35:01.967 --> 01:35:04.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and expect him to hear me,

01:35:04.511 --> 01:35:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“why shouldn’t I also listen to God
by reading his Word every day?

01:35:09.432 --> 01:35:11.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we want to be a good friend,

01:35:11.476 --> 01:35:14.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would we do all the talking?”

01:35:14.396 --> 01:35:17.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
He makes a very good point, doesn’t he?

01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:20.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
By reading the Bible,
we are listening to Jehovah,

01:35:20.944 --> 01:35:24.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is how we get
his viewpoint on matters.

01:35:24.781 --> 01:35:29.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do you allow God
to speak to you every day?

01:35:30.996 --> 01:35:33.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can measure
how effective our Bible reading is

01:35:33.707 --> 01:35:37.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the influence it has
on our attitude and conduct.

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:41.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our peace is disturbed,
we can look into the source of divine wisdom

01:35:41.715 --> 01:35:44.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God’s guidance.

01:35:44.384 --> 01:35:47.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking prophetically of anointed Christians

01:35:47.095 --> 01:35:50.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 54:13, the prophet wrote:

01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:53.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All your sons will be taught by Jehovah,

01:35:53.893 --> 01:35:57.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and [their] peace . . . will be abundant.”

01:35:57.188 --> 01:36:01.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, those words apply in principle
to Christ’s other sheep as well.

01:36:01.318 --> 01:36:05.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, when Christ’s anointed brothers,
“the faithful and discreet slave,”

01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:08.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepare spiritual food for us,
such as this convention program,

01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:13.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
they hold firmly to Jehovah’s Word
and they never water it down.

01:36:13.955 --> 01:36:16.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
We always receive spiritual instruction

01:36:16.833 --> 01:36:20.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
that upholds Jehovah’s high moral standards,

01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:23.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are blessed with abundant peace

01:36:23.548 --> 01:36:26.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we accept Jehovah’s instruction.

01:36:28.219 --> 01:36:31.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah penned another prophecy
that is being fulfilled today,

01:36:31.598 --> 01:36:35.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we find that at Isaiah 2:2-4.

01:36:35.268 --> 01:36:37.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw in a vision of the last days

01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:40.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
people from all the nations
streaming to true worship.

01:36:40.315 --> 01:36:42.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for what reason?

01:36:42.317 --> 01:36:44.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah wrote of Jehovah:

01:36:44.361 --> 01:36:46.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will instruct us about his ways,

01:36:46.988 --> 01:36:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will walk in his paths.”

01:36:49.866 --> 01:36:51.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in what would this result?

01:36:51.868 --> 01:36:55.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that “they will beat their swords
into plowshares

01:36:55.538 --> 01:36:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their spears into pruning shears.

01:36:57.666 --> 01:37:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nation will not lift up sword
against nation,

01:37:00.543 --> 01:37:04.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor will they learn war anymore.”

01:37:04.923 --> 01:37:09.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his goodness, Jehovah is willing
to teach us imperfect humans

01:37:09.511 --> 01:37:13.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to achieve genuine,
abundant peace earth wide.

01:37:13.973 --> 01:37:17.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he does that through the pages
of his own written Word.

01:37:17.268 --> 01:37:20.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege it is
to be taught by our God!

01:37:21.981 --> 01:37:26.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what problem may threaten
the peace of our personal life,

01:37:26.486 --> 01:37:29.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
our family, or our congregation,

01:37:29.739 --> 01:37:34.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are confident that the solution
can be found in the Bible.

01:37:34.285 --> 01:37:36.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we have learned from this symposium,

01:37:36.788 --> 01:37:41.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
our continued love for Jehovah,
for our neighbor, and for God’s Word

01:37:41.751 --> 01:37:45.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
will lead to our enjoying everlasting peace

01:37:45.338 --> 01:37:47.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s new world.

01:37:49.342 --> 01:37:51.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers, for teaching us

01:37:51.678 --> 01:37:55.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
how love motivates our pursuit of peace.

01:37:56.391 --> 01:38:01.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us now has an opportunity
to praise Jehovah with song.

01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:04.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will sing song number 24, entitled

01:38:04.899 --> 01:38:07.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Come to Jehovah’s Mountain.”

01:38:07.277 --> 01:38:09.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 24.

Can you imagine a collection
of some 40 million books?

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:08.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would fill more than 800 miles,

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 1,300 kilometers, of bookshelves?

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, that is what you can find
in what has been described

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the largest library in the world

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.,

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States.

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:25.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which book would you say
is the most worthwhile to read

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
among all of those millions of volumes?

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can let the apostle Paul
answer that question.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his second letter to Timothy
at 2 Timothy 3:15,

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
he referred to “the holy writings,
which are able to make [us]

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
wise for salvation
through faith in Christ Jesus.”

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was referring, of course,
to God’s own written Word

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we know as the Bible.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
The contents of this book can give us
the wisdom that we need to gain salvation,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that makes it
the most worthwhile book on earth.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:02.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can a book have
such a profound effect on a person?

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when describing books
and their authors per se,

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:09.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
the secular writer Gilbert Highet once stated

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that books are not “lumps of lifeless paper,

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but minds alive on the shelves.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From each of them goes out
its own voice . . .

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So by taking down one of these volumes
and opening it,

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one can call into range
the voice of a man the author,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“far distant in time and space,

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:32.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hear him speaking to us,
mind to mind, heart to heart.”

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we take this book, the Bible,
down off the shelf and open it,

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are calling into range
the voice of its Author, Jehovah.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
And is he speaking to us
mind to mind, heart to heart?

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, he is.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, at Jeremiah 29:11,
Jehovah tells us:

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:56.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you, . . .

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give you a future and a hope.”

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at Proverbs 27:11, Jehovah tells us:

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be wise . . . and make my heart rejoice,

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can make a reply
to him who taunts me.”

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:15.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
How grateful we are
that Jehovah has given us

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
his precious Word, the Bible,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reveals his intimate thoughts
and feelings,

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
that draws us close to him,

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that teaches us
how to gain everlasting life!

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:30.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we love Jehovah,
we also love and cherish

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he tells us
through the pages of his written Word.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is exactly how the psalmist felt

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:40.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wrote the 119th Psalm.

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bible to Psalm 119,

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find verse 161.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:51.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Psalm 119:161.

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the latter part, it says:

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:59.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But my heart stands in awe of your words.”

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now see what more he wrote
in verses 167 and 168:

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I keep your reminders,
and I love them dearly.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I observe your orders and your reminders,

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you are aware of all that I do.”

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible writer did not view
God’s orders and reminders

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:25.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
as just a list of cold, legalistic statutes.

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be sure
that he did not consider them

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be burdensome.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he knew that they formed the basis

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the best life possible.

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:39.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is why he not only wanted
to learn God’s orders,

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also desired to observe,
or obey, them.

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist believed that God’s Word
is the one thing worth studying,

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that because of knowing
God’s orders and reminders,

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are far wiser than people

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:58.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
who know everything else
except God’s Word.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now look at what more he wrote in verse 165:

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abundant peace
belongs to those who love your law;

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:13.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
nothing can make them stumble.”

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:18.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herein lies a major reason
why we love God’s Word:

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abiding by it leads to genuine peace.

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:24.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone longs for peace in their life,

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:29.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and through the pages of the Bible,
we learn how to attain it.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:32.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we choose to live by God’s Word

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in the face of the trials
that arise in our life

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:40.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of which may try to steal away
our peace of mind and heart.

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:43.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, Jehovah knows what we
are going through every day of our lives

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:46.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stands ready to help us.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we love and obey Jehovah’s Word,

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not be stumbled spiritually
by what someone else does or says

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
or by any other matter or situation in life.

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:02.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does love for God’s Word
lead to such peace

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep us from stumbling?

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know
that “all scripture is inspired of God,”

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:13.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the Bible the most reliable guide
for every aspect of life.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, his wisdom
is infinitely superior to our own.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading the Bible enables us
to look at matters

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:23.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
from God’s elevated point of view.

00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:27.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is just as the prophet Isaiah wrote

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:30.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 55:8, 9.

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d like to open to that, please

00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:36.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 55:8, 9.

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:41.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote: “‘For my thoughts
are not your thoughts,

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:46.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your ways are not my ways,’
declares Jehovah.

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For as the heavens
are higher than the earth,

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:51.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so my ways are higher than your ways

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my thoughts than your thoughts.’”

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just imagine
—Jehovah’s thoughts and language

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be vastly superior to those of humans.

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he communicates with us,
as he does through the pages of the Bible,

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:10.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts

00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:12.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can understand them.

00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:15.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then as we take in all that Jehovah says,

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can let his thinking guide our thinking.

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:23.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading the Bible
can be likened to peering into a mirror

00:06:23.987 --> 00:06:26.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
because its message
has the power to allow us

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:29.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see ourselves as we really are

00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:32.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it shows us where adjustments
are needed

00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:34.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our attitude and conduct.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus far in this symposium,
we have seen how this can actually work.

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have seen two dramatizations
of a widowed mother

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:47.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the Bible to help her teenage children
avoid being stumbled

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
by other young people
who had been harassing them.

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, her son, Gabe,
had been called a coward

00:06:54.685 --> 00:06:56.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a couple of tough-looking youths

00:06:56.937 --> 00:06:59.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
while he was engaged in public witnessing.

00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:02.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And her daughter, Olivia,
had been chided by other girls

00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:07.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
for not being interested in dating
one of the guys in her class.

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:12.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their mother used what Jehovah inspired
the apostle Paul to write about

00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:14.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his ordeal in prison

00:07:14.913 --> 00:07:18.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show how he was able
to preserve his peace

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very difficult situation.

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that, in turn, helped Olivia and Gabe
to safeguard their own peace.

00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:31.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what more the mother finds
in the Bible to help Olivia

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:36.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
avoid being stumbled into conduct
that could rob her of peace.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:40.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:41.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:41.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she ever?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:44.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even think she likes guys.

00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:45.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she’s into girls?

00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:46.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bet she’s still a virgin.

00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:51.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia, what are you thinking?

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:57.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t—I don’t know how they could do that.

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:59.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even follow them.

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this doesn’t stop,

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if I can . . .

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:11.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re strong, OK.

00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just can’t let them get to you.

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:22.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels out of your control, doesn’t it?

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, I think we need another Bible example.

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:42.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when we studied
about the Shulammite girl?

00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:48.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I remember.

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who was pressuring her?

00:08:54.054 --> 00:08:56.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon.

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:04.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she wasn’t interested in him,

00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:08.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like I’m not interested
in that boy Jake, so . . .

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it wasn’t just him;

00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:14.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were the daughters of Jerusalem
in Solomon’s court.

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:19.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
They urged her to accept his attentions.

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you remember what she said

00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Song of Solomon chapter 2?

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:32.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “I put you under oath,

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:34.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O daughters of Jerusalem,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the gazelles and the does of the field:

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:41.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me

00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:43.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it feels inclined.”

00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:48.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
So despite all of the pressure,
who was really in control?

00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was.

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:58.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one was going to push her
into something that she didn’t want to do.

00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:05.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
She even said: “I am a wall.”

00:10:08.003 --> 00:10:10.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the same power.

00:10:12.883 --> 00:10:17.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you believe that,
it’ll change how you handle the pressure.

00:10:20.348 --> 00:10:21.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now give me a hug.

00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:36.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, update on yesterday’s topic.

00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess she still needs a man.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
She needs something.

00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:47.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just posted it. Go like my video.

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:51.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
All they want is to see me give in.

00:10:52.797 --> 00:10:56.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, update on yesterday’s topic.
I guess she still needs . . .

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would I give them the satisfaction?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:11:04.768 --> 00:11:07.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can make me stumble.

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:14.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a wall.”

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:31.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia’s mother thought
of another inspired Bible example,

00:11:31.419 --> 00:11:34.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of the Shulammite girl
who was being urged

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:38.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the young women in Solomon’s court
to accept his amorous attentions.

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:42.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
But despite the pressure,
the Shulammite girl remained in control

00:11:42.847 --> 00:11:47.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
for no one was going to push her
into something that she did not want to do.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:51.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia got the point
as she thought to herself:

00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:53.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:11:53.817 --> 00:11:57.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can make me stumble. I am a wall.’

00:11:58.655 --> 00:12:02.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s obvious that the mother
had a real love for God’s Word, knew it well,

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:07.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and calmly and skillfully used it
to guide the thinking of her children

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:10.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep them from stumbling.

00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:15.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many people these days
put God’s Word out of their mind

00:12:15.505 --> 00:12:18.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent it from influencing their life.

00:12:18.466 --> 00:12:22.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as the world’s morals decline,
we must stick loyally to God’s Word

00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:26.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
to conform our conduct
to his pure and holy thinking

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:30.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthen our determination
to live by his standards.

00:12:32.272 --> 00:12:35.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is just what the apostle Paul
urged us to do

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:38.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 12:2.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you would turn there, please
—Romans 12:2.

00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:46.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote:

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:49.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And stop being molded
by this system of things,

00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:53.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but be transformed
by making your mind over,

00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:58.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may prove to yourselves
the good and acceptable

00:12:58.048 --> 00:13:01.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perfect will of God.”

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:04.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word strengthens us
to resist conforming

00:13:04.512 --> 00:13:06.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the corrupting practices of Satan’s world

00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:10.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to suppress temptations
toward wrongdoing.

00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:13.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we prove to ourselves

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the will of God is good and perfect,

00:13:16.858 --> 00:13:18.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we should also accept

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that loyally obeying God
is the best way of living.

00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:25.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a direct connection
between heeding Scriptural teachings

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:29.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obeying or enjoying genuine peace.

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:34.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, for Jehovah’s Word
to have such power in our lives,

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:38.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to read the Bible every day

00:13:38.004 --> 00:13:42.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditate on why its counsel
is beneficial.

00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:44.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means reading it at a pace

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
that allows us to ponder
on what we are reading.

00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing this helps to fix in our minds
the portions

00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:54.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are especially helpful to us.

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:58.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
When asked why he reads the Bible
every day,

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:00.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
one Christian replied:

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I repeatedly pray to Jehovah
during the day

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and expect him to hear me,

00:14:06.074 --> 00:14:10.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“why shouldn’t I also listen to God
by reading his Word every day?

00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:13.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we want to be a good friend,

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:15.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would we do all the talking?”

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:18.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
He makes a very good point, doesn’t he?

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:22.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
By reading the Bible,
we are listening to Jehovah,

00:14:22.507 --> 00:14:26.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is how we get
his viewpoint on matters.

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:31.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do you allow God
to speak to you every day?

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:35.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can measure
how effective our Bible reading is

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:39.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the influence it has
on our attitude and conduct.

00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:43.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our peace is disturbed,
we can look into the source of divine wisdom

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:45.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God’s guidance.

00:14:45.947 --> 00:14:48.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking prophetically of anointed Christians

00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:51.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 54:13, the prophet wrote:

00:14:51.953 --> 00:14:55.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All your sons will be taught by Jehovah,

00:14:55.457 --> 00:14:58.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and [their] peace . . . will be abundant.”

00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:02.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, those words apply in principle
to Christ’s other sheep as well.

00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:06.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, when Christ’s anointed brothers,
“the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:10.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepare spiritual food for us,
such as this convention program,

00:15:10.513 --> 00:15:15.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
they hold firmly to Jehovah’s Word
and they never water it down.

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:18.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
We always receive spiritual instruction

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
that upholds Jehovah’s high moral standards,

00:15:22.192 --> 00:15:25.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are blessed with abundant peace

00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:28.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we accept Jehovah’s instruction.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:33.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah penned another prophecy
that is being fulfilled today,

00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:36.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we find that at Isaiah 2:2-4.

00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:38.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw in a vision of the last days

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:41.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
people from all the nations
streaming to true worship.

00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:43.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for what reason?

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah wrote of Jehovah:

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:48.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will instruct us about his ways,

00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will walk in his paths.”

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:53.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in what would this result?

00:15:53.431 --> 00:15:57.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that “they will beat their swords
into plowshares

00:15:57.018 --> 00:15:59.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their spears into pruning shears.

00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:02.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nation will not lift up sword
against nation,

00:16:02.106 --> 00:16:06.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor will they learn war anymore.”

00:16:06.486 --> 00:16:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his goodness, Jehovah is willing
to teach us imperfect humans

00:16:11.074 --> 00:16:15.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to achieve genuine,
abundant peace earth wide.

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:18.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he does that through the pages
of his own written Word.

00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:22.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege it is
to be taught by our God!

00:16:23.545 --> 00:16:28.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what problem may threaten
the peace of our personal life,

00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:31.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
our family, or our congregation,

00:16:31.302 --> 00:16:35.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are confident that the solution
can be found in the Bible.

00:16:35.849 --> 00:16:38.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we have learned from this symposium,

00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
our continued love for Jehovah,
for our neighbor, and for God’s Word

00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
will lead to our enjoying everlasting peace

00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s new world.

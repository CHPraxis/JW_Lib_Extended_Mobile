00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:03.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:06.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that we really appreciate

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
your attending
this “Pursue Peace”! Convention.

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:12.032 line:10% position:50% align:center
Speaking of peace,

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.034 line:10% position:50% align:center
we love the serene setting

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.078 line:10% position:50% align:center
here at our world headquarters

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Blue Lake in New York State.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the water is as smooth as a mirror.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:27.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
We occasionally see eagles and hawks fly by.

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the fall of the year
when the leaves change color,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
the forest can look spectacular.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
More important
than this tranquil setting, though,

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the abundant peace

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to his organization.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can say this because of the peace
and harmony that unite us

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:49.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what our nationality,

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:54.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
language, race, tribe,
or social background is.

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is truly spectacular,

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we consider
all the turmoil in the world

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how divided people are

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
politically, socially, and religiously.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we cannot take
our beautiful peace for granted;

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not maintained automatically.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:18.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us personally must pursue peace

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to have God’s approval.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:26.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly wants his worshippers
to enjoy lasting peace.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was true in ancient times.

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
God told Moses to have the priests in Israel

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
bless the people with very reassuring words.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice these words that we find

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Numbers 6:24-26,

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:47.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hear what the priests
were to say to the people:

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:51.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you.

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah make his face shine upon you,

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:56.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and may he favor you.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah lift up his face toward you

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grant you peace.”

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next verse states:

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:05.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they must place my name

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
“upon the people of Israel,

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I may bless them.”

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has placed his name on us too,

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is richly blessing us.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what
this convention program is going to cover

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:22.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’ll know how we can continue

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:26.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy God’s blessing of peace.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll consider
how to be at peace with God.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our greatest peace comes

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
from having
a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making him our best Friend benefits us

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leads to peace
in every other aspect of our life.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we reach out
for a close relationship with God?

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need more
than a superficial knowledge of him.

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to get to know Jehovah as a person

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and admire his qualities and ways.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:02.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we can love what he loves

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hate what he hates.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this program,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen for details about Jehovah

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will draw you ever closer to him.

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we’ll consider
how to be at peace with others.

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our homes should be havens
for peace for our families.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means more than the absence of arguing.

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves putting the interests
of our family members ahead of our own.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:33.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ll learn from this program,

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
that includes showing love
and respect to one another,

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
working as a team,

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
improving family communication,

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worshipping Jehovah together.

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we’ll consider

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:49.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to be at peace despite trials

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:51.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and troublesome world conditions.

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this convention,
we’re going to tour the world to see how,

00:03:56.673 --> 00:04:00.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite opposition, illness,

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic problems, and natural disasters,

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:06.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers really care for one another,

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:10.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they receive help
from Jehovah’s organization,

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they continue
their spiritual activity.

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what may threaten
our lives or livelihood,

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:22.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be confident
that Jehovah can help us get through it

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and retain our peace of mind and heart.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:27.830 line:10% position:50% align:center
Fourth, we’ll consider

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.916 line:10% position:50% align:center
how to enjoy peace eternally.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:35.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once God’s Kingdom
has lifted mankind to perfection,

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll no longer have to pursue peace.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Psalm 72:7 promises:

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will flourish,

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace will abound
until the moon is no more.”

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, there will be peace forever.

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:54.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
This program will help us

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anticipate future blessings from Jehovah.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see why “Pursue Peace!”

00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:05.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
was well chosen
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:07.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
To pursue something means

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:10.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
to chase it in order to capture it.

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the influence of Satan,

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
his wicked world, and our own imperfections,

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:19.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace is constantly trying to elude us.

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:24.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we have to chase after it
to capture it in our lives.

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:29.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention program will help us do that.

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
May the God of peace
be with all of you now and forever!

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the heartfelt wish
of all of us on the Governing Body

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:41.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love you dearly.

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:46.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the entire convention program!

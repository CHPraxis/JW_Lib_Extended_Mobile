00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:03.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this part of the symposium,

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:06.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Share ‘the Good News of Peace,’”

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to discuss
the need to take the initiative.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re going to look

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
at why we should take the initiative,

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:18.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to take the initiative,

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then a concluding thought
about who’s helping

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:25.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
in directing us in our preaching work.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first of all, why take the initiative?

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about it.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing about being Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:38.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we’re never off duty.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never stop being
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
—wherever we are or whatever we’re doing.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it isn’t just when we’re out

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the formal preaching work
with a congregation group

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
all the time.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no such thing as being off duty

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to give you an idea of how 

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
significant this is
with informal witnessing,

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will tell you a statistic:
A survey was taken some years ago

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and you’d be surprised, possibly),

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one group
of over 200 baptized Witnesses,

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
now notice, over 40 percent

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been contacted by informal witnessing.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the door-to-door work is crucial.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, during COVID-19
that’s been inhibited

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
—letter writing has its place
and also phone witnessing.

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the point is, there are other times

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we can do some witnessing informally.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s examine how to do it?

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the best example
of how to do informal witnessing

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
is, of course, Christ Jesus.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s an account that all of us
are familiar with in the Bible book of John.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:09.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please find John chapter 4,

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:14.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to take a look
at how Jesus took the initiative

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then imitate him

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
—do just as he did.

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice here in John chapter 4

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
(we get the context),
they’ve been traveling through Samaria.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then verse 6, we’ll read:

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, Jacob’s well was there.

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Jesus, tired out as he was
from the journey,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was sitting at the well.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about the sixth hour.”

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s interesting, is it not?

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:50.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was tired.

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a perfect man, but human,

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his journey tired him out.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s there
about noon sitting at the well.

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now notice what happens in verse 7:

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:12.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to her: ‘Give me a drink.’”

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:18.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Real simple—“Give me a drink.”

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from this?

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you noticed, Jesus was tired.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get tired

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of being imperfect.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a perfect man gets tired out,
certainly we get tired.

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you may feel:
‘Well, you know, maybe I could witness

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to this person
—take the initiative.

00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:40.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I just don’t feel like it.
I’m tired.’

00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:43.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not with Jesus.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, to imitate Jesus,
even in the case when you’re tired,

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re thinking of others.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to take the opportunity
to start a conversation.

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the initial goal.

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice something else here

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:01.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we learn in the 9th verse

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
of John chapter 4:

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:08.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the Samaritan woman said to him:

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:12.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘How is it that you, despite being a Jew,

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:16.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask me for a drink even though
I am a Samaritan woman?’”

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we learn more here in parentheses:

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For Jews have no dealings
with the Samaritans.”

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it went both ways.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the way prejudice was
—“no dealings”—

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:32.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on top of that, she’s a woman.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
And women were not treated very nicely

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
during that period in man’s history.

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:42.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she’s a Samaritan, she’s a woman,

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:46.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus asks her for a drink.

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
He starts a conversation with her.

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these are the things we learn from this:

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:55.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t make any assumptions about her

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:59.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obviously knew that she was a woman

00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:04.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a Samaritan traveling
through Samaria at that time.

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:07.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t refuse
to speak to her

00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of that.

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:12.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the lesson for us is:

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t judge people by what you see,

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on their culture
or color of their skin.

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world is filled with judges.

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:25.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:27.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t do that.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
We leave the judging
to Jehovah and Jesus Christ.

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:34.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t judge
whether you think they’ll converse with you.

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wrong.

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:39.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus didn’t do that,

00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he set the perfect example for us.

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:46.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go ahead, and if you’re
a little nervous about it,

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:50.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we beg Jehovah for his spirit to help us

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to give us the courage to witness

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:56.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his beautiful name and purposes.

00:05:56.793 --> 00:06:00.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he also teaches us

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:02.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
something else interesting here.

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is where in taking the initiative,

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
you start a conversation;

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:10.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
you don’t rush into things.

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:14.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice, we read verse 9,

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:17.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then they had
this conversation take place

00:06:17.397 --> 00:06:20.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
through these following verses here.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get to verse 24 where he mentions

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘God is a Spirit, and you
must worship him with spirit and truth.’

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:30.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now here’s what happens

00:06:30.577 --> 00:06:32.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
after they had this fine conversation

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:35.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after he simply asked for a drink.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 25:

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:39.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The woman said to him:

00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:43.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I know that Messiah is coming,
who is called Christ.

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:48.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever that one comes,
he will declare all things to us openly.’”

00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:51.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
She spoke out of her heart.

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:53.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice verse 26:

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:58.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to her: ‘I am he,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one speaking to you.’”

00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:03.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
My, what a moment!

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she’s blessed
with having the Messiah himself speak to her.

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, give it some thought.

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:14.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if Jesus, rather than saying:

00:07:14.913 --> 00:07:17.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give me a drink,”
started off with saying:

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:21.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I am the Messiah.
Give me a drink.’

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:24.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I don’t know.

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jesus had Jehovah’s spirit
and heavenly wisdom,

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
he entered the conversation first.

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:34.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s what we want
to keep in mind and try to do ourselves

00:07:34.808 --> 00:07:37.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to have a conversation.

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:40.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might just be speaking from your heart

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to engage the person.

00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:48.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you could be
in the doctor’s office waiting room.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you speak from your heart,

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you notice the person is looking at you:

00:07:54.578 --> 00:07:59.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boy, I look forward to the day
when I’ll never be sick again.”

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:03.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they could look at you and think,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, this guy is crazy.’

00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:10.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or they could say: “Well, that would be nice.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes you believe
that’s going to happen for you?”

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:15.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Either way, you’re starting

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the initiative
to start a conversation,

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:21.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leave the rest to Jehovah.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the one
that gets the credit for the results.

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:29.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, next, we have a video here.

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:31.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,

00:08:31.323 --> 00:08:35.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a sister
finds an effective way

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:38.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
to witness informally.

00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:02.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seemed nice.

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:06.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew what Yuri was thinking.

00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:10.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to start a conversation,

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:13.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t want to bother them either.

00:09:20.997 --> 00:09:23.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when an opportunity came,

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:31.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just froze.

00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:41.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was in a rush to give a witness.

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:57.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt forced.

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:07.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped to hear that we’d all been there.

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:10.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our past experiences were similar.

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:20.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever we didn’t put pressure on ourselves

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:23.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just looked for something in common
to talk about,

00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:28.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could usually find a moment
when we could say something about the Bible.

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:32.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was curious why we were dressed up.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turns out that she’d never talked

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:38.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s Witnesses before.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:51.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciated
how she took the initiative.

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:55.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you see the contrast there
that at one point she froze.

00:10:55.175 --> 00:10:59.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it is stressful—no doubt about it.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:01.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re only human.

00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:04.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then she rushed
into things running after her with the tract.

00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:07.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, give it some thought.

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to have a conversation,

00:11:09.356 --> 00:11:13.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
then let the spirit move it,
and that would be imitating Jesus.

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:18.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then this can move
to getting into the spiritual purpose

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:21.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
of initiating the conversation.

00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:24.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a good example,
give it a try, brothers and sisters,

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:28.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let Jehovah bless your efforts.

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to conclude,

00:11:30.877 --> 00:11:34.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to share this beautiful thought

00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:36.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to this work we’re engaging in

00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:40.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sharing “the good news of peace”
by taking the initiative.

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:44.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget this, and you know it,
but it’s a good reminder

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:47.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 14.

00:11:47.894 --> 00:11:52.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here in Revelation

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
(familiar to most of you listening),

00:11:55.944 --> 00:11:59.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 6, let’s read it:

00:11:59.072 --> 00:12:02.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:06.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:09.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth, to every

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:12.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
nation and tribe and tongue and people.”

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:17.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is profound, obviously,

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:19.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
an “angel flying in midheaven.”

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:22.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote helps us;
it’s overhead

00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:24.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
—where the birds fly.

00:12:24.973 --> 00:12:26.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, you see them.

00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:31.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, another ‘angel in midheaven,’
that’s how close they are.

00:12:31.563 --> 00:12:35.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is something
you want to meditate on.

00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:38.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, when I was in the traveling work,

00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:43.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes I’d be working with one
of the brothers or one of the sisters,

00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:47.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had opposition

00:12:47.787 --> 00:12:49.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some of the territories we’d work.

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could tell they’re feeling the stress,

00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:57.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I know it was because of the reaction
of some of these householders.

00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:59.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what I used to enjoy doing

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:04.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and they appreciated it
after they realized what I was doing),

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d be walking along
and then I would just stop and I’d look up.

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:10.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d say, “Do you see him?”

00:13:10.435 --> 00:13:13.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’d say, “Who?”

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:16.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’s right up there above the trees.”

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:20.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’d look at me like,
‘Our circuit overseer has lost it.’

00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:22.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I said, “See,”

00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:25.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would tell them
about Revelation 14:6.

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:27.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re in the preaching work,

00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:32.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s informal or formal door-to-door,

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angels are the real reapers.

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:38.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least one is nearby.

00:13:38.713 --> 00:13:41.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a profound thought!

00:13:41.383 --> 00:13:43.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are the real harvesters.

00:13:43.718 --> 00:13:48.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are the ones directing us
to the “rightly disposed” people.

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:50.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t ever forget that.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to being ready
to share “the good news of peace,”

00:13:54.688 --> 00:13:59.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
you go ahead and take the initiative
to start conversations.

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:02.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have valuable opportunities

00:14:02.487 --> 00:14:06.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share “the good news of peace.”

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:12.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Gary Breaux,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:19.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:22.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Follow Up on Interest.”

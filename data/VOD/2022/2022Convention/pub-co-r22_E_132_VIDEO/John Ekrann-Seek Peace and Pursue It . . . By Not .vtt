00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:06.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title of this series of four talks
is “Seek Peace and Pursue It,”

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:10.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s based on 1 Peter 3:11.

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Peter 3:11:

00:00:17.456 --> 00:00:21.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let him turn away from what is bad
and do what is good;

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:26.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
let him seek peace and pursue it.”

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:31.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we have to pursue peace,
and pursuit requires effort.

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:36.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had to chase a piece
of paper that was in your hands

00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:38.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got blown away by the wind,

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just once you get to it,
the wind blows it away again and again?

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can really take quite some effort

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
to retrieve and get that paper
back in your hands.

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:53.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just standing there and watching
the paper blow farther and farther away

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:56.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not going to get it back.

00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:59.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, peace can be a lot like that paper.

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:02.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
At some point, it can get blown away,

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to then chase,

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:09.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
or pursue, it to get that peace back again.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
This series of talks will help us
to pursue peace in four ways:

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:17.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not quickly taking offense,

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
by apologizing,

00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving freely,

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by using our gift of speech wisely.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:30.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider our first way to pursue peace:

00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:35.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Avoid quickly taking offense.

00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:37.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, because we are imperfect,

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:41.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might misjudge others
and quickly take offense.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that we say quickly take offense.

00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:46.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s an important word.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to avoid jumping
to conclusions quickly

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:53.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we actually have the facts.

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:58.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even faithful men like Jesus’ apostles
have taken offense too quickly.

00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:01.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may recall the time that Jesus
and his apostles

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:04.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
were looking for lodging
in a Samaritan village.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Samaritans in that village
rudely denied them lodging.

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:14.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 9:54-56,

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:17.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostles—James and John—
say to Jesus:

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:22.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Lord, do you want us to call fire down
from heaven and annihilate them?”

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:28.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus rebukes them for their
rash and rather violent suggestion.

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the serious consequences

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:36.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
had Jesus yielded to the violent temper
of James and John.

00:02:36.562 --> 00:02:41.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Samaritans could have become
prejudiced against the Kingdom message.

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:45.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, Jesus pursues a peaceful solution.

00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:50.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account says
‘they simply went to a different village.’

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:54.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, does this mean we’re saying
we can never take offense?

00:02:54.582 --> 00:02:58.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you may have a legitimate
“cause for complaint.”

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:03.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
The key point is that we should not
quickly draw conclusions

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we hear all the facts.

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:10.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 18:13 says:

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anyone replies to a matter
before he hears the facts,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is foolish and humiliating.”

00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:21.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:25.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
note what helps one sister
to overlook an offense.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I expected more from you.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:31.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossiping about my posts!

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:38.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
wait, please!

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what’s happening.

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:53.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you talk to Emily about my posts?

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:55.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we did . . .

00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:56.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you gossiped about me.

00:03:56.856 --> 00:03:57.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I would . . .

00:03:57.857 --> 00:03:59.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
I looked up to you!

00:03:59.317 --> 00:03:59.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never . . .

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:01.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re supposed to be the mature one,

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:03.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re just like Emily,
busy running your mouth.

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:04.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley!

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I can see you’re upset,

00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:11.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
but trust me,
this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:22.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never ever say anything
behind your back.

00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:26.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please calm down.

00:04:31.393 --> 00:04:35.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I just feel so alone

00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:40.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
—between Nana and work—

00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then knowing all of you
are talking about me.

00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:50.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise, that’s not what happened.

00:04:52.457 --> 00:04:56.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just really tired and overwhelmed.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why don’t we
just slow things down a little.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:06.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, meetings
always make me feel better,

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
even on my worst days.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we go inside,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
clean up a little,
and enjoy the program together.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then afterward, we can all talk.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise, it’ll be OK.

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:31.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley really was upset.

00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:35.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had already concluded that she
was being gossiped about by everyone.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves
like Haley feeling offended,

00:05:40.258 --> 00:05:44.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we avoid quickly taking offense?

00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:48.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we must stop and think.

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Ecclesiastes 7:9

00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:54.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some very good advice
in these situations

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:58.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ecclesiastes 7:9:

00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:01.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be quick to take offense,

00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:06.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the taking of offense lodges
in the bosom of fools.”

00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:10.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Celia said in the parking lot to Haley,

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:13.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please calm down.”

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in those situations,

00:06:15.212 --> 00:06:17.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need to think about what you know

00:06:17.548 --> 00:06:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, just as important, what you don’t know.

00:06:21.177 --> 00:06:24.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know what you were told happened,

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what was really said?

00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:30.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video,
Haley quickly believed what she was told.

00:06:30.812 --> 00:06:34.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did not even ask Celia
what she really said.

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:37.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you may know what was said,

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:41.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
but do you know what was
really meant by it?

00:06:41.907 --> 00:06:44.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley asked,
“Did you talk about . . . my posts?”

00:06:44.702 --> 00:06:46.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Celia said, “Yes.”

00:06:46.704 --> 00:06:49.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And immediately, Haley assumed the worst.

00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:55.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps we misjudged
the person who hurt us.

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:59.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley misjudged Celia
on the spot by saying,

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:02.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re just as bad as Emily.’

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had not even heard from Celia yet.

00:07:06.308 --> 00:07:09.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley said to Celia
that she was the mature one,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one she looked up to,

00:07:11.022 --> 00:07:14.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet she was quick to believe
the worst about her.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley had not stopped
and really thought about what

00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:20.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was thinking and saying.

00:07:21.658 --> 00:07:24.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps she was having a hard day.

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:28.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Celia really set a fine example for us.

00:07:28.457 --> 00:07:31.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though Haley spoke harshly to her,

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:34.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Celia was calm and listened to Haley.

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Haley explained how
she was feeling lonely,

00:07:37.717 --> 00:07:40.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing and caring for her grandmother,

00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:44.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can see the love and concern
that Celia had for Haley,

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:48.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though just moments before
she had spoken really harshly to her.

00:07:49.688 --> 00:07:53.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, besides taking time
to think things through,

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:57.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also need to remember
that it is Jehovah’s opinion of us

00:07:57.613 --> 00:08:00.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
that matters the most.

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:03.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s an important point,
especially when we deal

00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:06.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
with misunderstandings
or false accusations.

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:12.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it:
Jehovah is an eyewitness to everything.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate that, I want you to imagine

00:08:16.258 --> 00:08:18.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
you had a traffic accident.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you were just sitting at the stop sign,

00:08:21.013 --> 00:08:25.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
but another car ran straight into you.

00:08:25.017 --> 00:08:28.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
The police come,
and the person that ran into you

00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:33.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that you ran into them,
and the police believe them.

00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:37.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take the matter to court.

00:08:37.072 --> 00:08:41.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
The judge listens as the other person
says that you ran into them;

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
however, before you can say anything,

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:49.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge says:
“No, that is not what happened.

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:53.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was there walking on the sidewalk
across the street that day,

00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:55.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I saw the whole thing.”

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s extremely unlikely
that you can go to court and expect

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:03.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge for your case
to have been an eyewitness.

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:06.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
This does illustrate, though,
the peace of mind that we can have

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:11.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that Jehovah is an eyewitness
to all that happens.

00:09:12.693 --> 00:09:16.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when falsely accused
or when we have a misunderstanding

00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:21.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we cannot seem to clear up,
it is of great comfort for us to know

00:09:21.536 --> 00:09:26.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was there that day
and saw the whole thing.

00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t need to take offense
at every negative thing

00:09:31.547 --> 00:09:34.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is said or done around us

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
or feel we have to defend ourselves
as being right on every occasion.

00:09:39.722 --> 00:09:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would surely wear out emotionally

00:09:42.558 --> 00:09:46.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and probably not have very many friends.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:53.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be willing
to overlook minor transgressions.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at Proverbs 19:11

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 19:11.

00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:04.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us?

00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:09.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The insight of a man
certainly slows down his anger,

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is beauty on his part
to overlook an offense.”

00:10:15.594 --> 00:10:19.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
So can you “overlook an offense”?

00:10:19.056 --> 00:10:23.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the proverb said,
that ‘is beauty on our part.’

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:26.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
If not and you have
a serious cause for complaint,

00:10:26.647 --> 00:10:30.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
handle matters
according to Jehovah’s direction.

00:10:30.276 --> 00:10:32.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show insight.

00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slow down any anger.

00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:39.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think carefully, and listen patiently

00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:42.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure you clearly have all the facts

00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
before you become offended
or take action.

00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:49.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that piece of paper
that you had in your hands

00:10:49.296 --> 00:10:52.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got blown away by the wind?

00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:56.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if it was a hundred-dollar bill?

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:58.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you would make every effort

00:10:58.222 --> 00:11:02.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue it and get it back
because it’s valuable.

00:11:02.435 --> 00:11:07.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our peace with our brothers
is far more valuable than paper money.

00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:09.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our peace
with our brothers or sisters

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:14.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
is blown away
by misunderstandings, mistakes, or sin,

00:11:14.198 --> 00:11:18.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we should pursue peace
and try hard to get it back.

00:11:20.163 --> 00:11:24.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we glorify God and promote peace

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we avoid quickly taking offense.

00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:32.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:35.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:39.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’
. . . By Apologizing.”

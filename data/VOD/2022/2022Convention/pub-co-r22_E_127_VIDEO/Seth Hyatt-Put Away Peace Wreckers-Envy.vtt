00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:03.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is envy?

00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:04.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know?

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:09.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s important that we be able to identify
the symptoms of envy.

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:11.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because envy is an expression
of hatred.

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:18.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an enemy of peace.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if left unchecked,

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:24.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can result in spiritual death.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:29.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
As described in the Bible,
envy has two symptoms.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is probably more familiar.

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:34.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
An envious person wants

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
what someone else has.

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the second symptom

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
that makes envy especially dangerous.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:48.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
An envious person not only wants
what someone else has,

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also doesn’t want
the other person to have it.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an example:

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first century,
Jewish religious leaders envied Jesus

00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:04.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus was much appreciated
by the common people.

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:07.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus dealt with people,

00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:10.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
including lowly ones,
in a way that dignified them.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, he was appreciated.

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:17.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
The religious leaders envied him.

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:22.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather than adjusting their own way
of dealing with people,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
they attacked Jesus verbally

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:29.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an effort to destroy
his good reputation.

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:33.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spread malicious slander.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only did they want
what Jesus had,

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:40.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also they didn’t want
Jesus to have it.

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:44.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder envy is listed
as one of “the works of the flesh”

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 5:21.

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a dangerous quality

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to avoid.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does envy disrupt peace?

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:05.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Envy undermines, damages,

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:09.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even destroys relationships

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:13.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the family and in the congregation.

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:17.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the example of Jacob

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:20.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his 12 sons.

00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:25.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob had special affection
for one of his sons, Joseph.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
Joseph’s brothers became envious.

00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:32.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the envy manifest itself?

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the fruitage?

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:39.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they dealt treacherously
with Joseph, selling him into slavery.

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:43.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as if that weren’t bad enough,
they compounded their wrong

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
by lying to Jacob,

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling him that Joseph was dead.

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:52.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Bible account,

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:56.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob “refused to be comforted.”

00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:59.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
He mourned Joseph for years.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a terrible consequence of envy!

00:03:03.557 --> 00:03:06.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s clear that envy

00:03:06.143 --> 00:03:08.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows no room for love,

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
compassion, or kindness.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those qualities go out the window.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:17.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re replaced by qualities

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:22.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as hatred, strife, fits of anger.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:28.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can envy disrupt the peace
of a congregation?

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:32.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the examples
of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:36.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
They envied Moses and Aaron

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation of Israel.

00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did that envy manifest itself?

00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they began
to speak negatively—critically—

00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:50.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s representatives,
even accusing Moses

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
of playing the prince
and lifting himself up above the others.

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:59.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
They forgot that Jehovah

00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:03.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
had put Moses and Aaron
in their positions of responsibility.

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:07.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah react

00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:11.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that manifestation of envy?

00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:15.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
He destroyed those three men
and all who supported them.

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a time, the congregation
was robbed of its peace,

00:04:19.307 --> 00:04:22.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the accounts
certainly provide some insight

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:26.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
into Jehovah’s view of envy.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, by this point,
you’re no doubt thinking,

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:32.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I would never want something
so badly that I would

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:36.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
damage someone else to get it.’

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re all imperfect.

00:04:38.412 --> 00:04:40.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a treacherous heart,

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:44.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and envy is insidious.

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:46.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:51.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how envy
threatens to disrupt peace.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad news?

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:19.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a sweetie.

00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds me that I want to speak to her
about a necklace.

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:23.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too?

00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:25.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:26.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:05:26.632 --> 00:05:29.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone thinks she’s “Miss Wonderful”;

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:31.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s starting to agree.

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:36.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems it’s all about Haley.

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:44.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your tea is getting cold.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re changing the subject.

00:05:49.157 --> 00:05:51.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:54.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’ve brought this up before.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:01.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re friends; you pioneer together.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, and that’s why I’m concerned.

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concern is good,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:14.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you notice?

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:33.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Emily is suffering
from an onset of envy.

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
how she questioned Haley’s motives

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:44.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and potentially called
Haley’s reputation into question?

00:06:46.345 --> 00:06:49.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could happen to any one of us.

00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:54.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we battle and conquer envy?

00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:58.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
By cultivating two beautiful qualities,

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility and contentment.

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what the Bible
has to say about humility.

00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:10.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Philippians chapter 2,

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:13.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to begin reading
in verse 3

00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:19.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Philippians 2:3:

00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness

00:07:24.387 --> 00:07:27.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
or out of egotism.”

00:07:27.015 --> 00:07:29.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is egotism?

00:07:29.017 --> 00:07:34.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s having
an exaggerated opinion of oneself.

00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:38.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that the religious leaders
in Jesus’ day,

00:07:38.778 --> 00:07:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph’s brothers,

00:07:41.323 --> 00:07:45.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram

00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:47.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
had this affliction?

00:07:47.037 --> 00:07:50.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they have an exaggerated view
of themselves?

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:52.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without question!

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:56.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s an affliction
that could affect any one of us.

00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:58.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the solution?

00:07:58.383 --> 00:08:00.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Paul continues:

00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:03.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But with humility [or, lowliness of mind]

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:06.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider others superior to you”

00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:08.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
—or consider others

00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:13.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
as more important than yourself.

00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:15.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that kind of mindset

00:08:15.944 --> 00:08:20.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows a person to do what’s stated
in verse 4:

00:08:20.074 --> 00:08:22.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As you look out not only

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:24.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for your own interests,

00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:27.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:31.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks out for others.

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t feel that he deserves

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:39.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than others.

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:44.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Contentment—a content person
is satisfied with what he has.

00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:49.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t compare
his privilege or his possession

00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:53.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
with another person’s privilege
or possession.

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:56.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s content.

00:08:56.155 --> 00:08:59.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility, contentment

00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:04.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
—with Jehovah’s help we can cultivate
these beautiful qualities—

00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
qualities that leave no room for envy.

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:12.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in doing so, we promote peace

00:09:12.924 --> 00:09:15.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
—inner peace, peace in our family,

00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:18.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace in the congregation.

00:09:18.972 --> 00:09:23.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can be sure
that Jehovah appreciates that.

00:09:24.937 --> 00:09:28.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:09:28.817 --> 00:09:32.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:09:32.362 --> 00:09:36.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers—Dishonesty.”

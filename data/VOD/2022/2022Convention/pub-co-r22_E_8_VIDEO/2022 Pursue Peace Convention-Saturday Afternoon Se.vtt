After watching the 2020 regional convention

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
in her native language of Chichewa,

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
16-year-old Lisa from Malawi stated:

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With this convention, I saw
how Jehovah fulfilled his promise

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:40.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at Hebrews 13:5:

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I will never leave you,
and I will never abandon you.’”

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have made
similar appreciative comments

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
after watching the convention
in their language.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have made kind donations online

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:57.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
at donate.jw.org

00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by other means.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for these donations

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
that support
our extensive translation efforts.

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:12.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier in our program,
we discussed five peace wreckers

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should “put away.”

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can we do
if peace has been disturbed?

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:23.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can it be restored, and if so, how?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to pay careful attention

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the following four-part symposium.

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother John Ekrann, a helper
to the Coordinators’ Committee,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
will start us off with the talk

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:38.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’ . . .

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
By Not Quickly Taking Offense.”

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title of this series of four talks
is “Seek Peace and Pursue It,”

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s based on 1 Peter 3:11.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Peter 3:11:

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let him turn away from what is bad
and do what is good;

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
let him seek peace and pursue it.”

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we have to pursue peace,
and pursuit requires effort.

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:24.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had to chase a piece
of paper that was in your hands

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got blown away by the wind,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just once you get to it,
the wind blows it away again and again?

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can really take quite some effort

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
to retrieve and get that paper
back in your hands.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just standing there and watching
the paper blow farther and farther away

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not going to get it back.

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:47.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, peace can be a lot like that paper.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
At some point, it can get blown away,

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:52.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to then chase,

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
or pursue, it to get that peace back again.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
This series of talks will help us
to pursue peace in four ways:

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not quickly taking offense,

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
by apologizing,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:10.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving freely,

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by using our gift of speech wisely.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider our first way to pursue peace:

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:23.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Avoid quickly taking offense.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:25.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, because we are imperfect,

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might misjudge others
and quickly take offense.

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that we say quickly take offense.

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:34.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s an important word.

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to avoid jumping
to conclusions quickly

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we actually have the facts.

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:46.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even faithful men like Jesus’ apostles
have taken offense too quickly.

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may recall the time that Jesus
and his apostles

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
were looking for lodging
in a Samaritan village.

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:57.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Samaritans in that village
rudely denied them lodging.

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 9:54-56,

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostles—James and John—
say to Jesus:

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Lord, do you want us to call fire down
from heaven and annihilate them?”

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus rebukes them for their
rash and rather violent suggestion.

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the serious consequences

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:24.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
had Jesus yielded to the violent temper
of James and John.

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:29.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Samaritans could have become
prejudiced against the Kingdom message.

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, Jesus pursues a peaceful solution.

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:38.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account says
‘they simply went to a different village.’

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:42.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, does this mean we’re saying
we can never take offense?

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you may have a legitimate
“cause for complaint.”

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:51.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
The key point is that we should not
quickly draw conclusions

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we hear all the facts.

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 18:13 says:

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anyone replies to a matter
before he hears the facts,

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is foolish and humiliating.”

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:09.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:13.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
note what helps one sister
to overlook an offense.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I expected more from you.

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossiping about my posts!

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:26.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:32.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley,

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
wait, please!

00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what’s happening.

00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:41.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you talk to Emily about my posts?

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:43.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we did . . .

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:44.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you gossiped about me.

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:45.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I would . . .

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:47.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
I looked up to you!

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:47.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never . . .

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:49.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re supposed to be the mature one,

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:51.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re just like Emily,
busy running your mouth.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley!

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I can see you’re upset,

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
but trust me,
this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:05.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:10.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never ever say anything
behind your back.

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please calm down.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I just feel so alone

00:06:26.448 --> 00:06:28.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
—between Nana and work—

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:34.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then knowing all of you
are talking about me.

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:38.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise, that’s not what happened.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just really tired and overwhelmed.

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why don’t we
just slow things down a little.

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:54.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, meetings
always make me feel better,

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
even on my worst days.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we go inside,

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:03.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
clean up a little,
and enjoy the program together.

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:07.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then afterward, we can all talk.

00:07:08.323 --> 00:07:11.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise, it’ll be OK.

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley really was upset.

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had already concluded that she
was being gossiped about by everyone.

00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:28.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves
like Haley feeling offended,

00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:32.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we avoid quickly taking offense?

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:36.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we must stop and think.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Ecclesiastes 7:9

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some very good advice
in these situations

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ecclesiastes 7:9:

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:49.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be quick to take offense,

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:54.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the taking of offense lodges
in the bosom of fools.”

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:58.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Celia said in the parking lot to Haley,

00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:01.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please calm down.”

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in those situations,

00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:05.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need to think about what you know

00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:09.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, just as important, what you don’t know.

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:12.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know what you were told happened,

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what was really said?

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:18.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video,
Haley quickly believed what she was told.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did not even ask Celia
what she really said.

00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:25.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you may know what was said,

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:29.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
but do you know what was
really meant by it?

00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:32.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley asked,
“Did you talk about . . . my posts?”

00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:34.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Celia said, “Yes.”

00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:37.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And immediately, Haley assumed the worst.

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:43.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps we misjudged
the person who hurt us.

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:47.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley misjudged Celia
on the spot by saying,

00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re just as bad as Emily.’

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:52.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had not even heard from Celia yet.

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:57.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley said to Celia
that she was the mature one,

00:08:57.015 --> 00:08:59.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one she looked up to,

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:02.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet she was quick to believe
the worst about her.

00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:06.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley had not stopped
and really thought about what

00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was thinking and saying.

00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps she was having a hard day.

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:16.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Celia really set a fine example for us.

00:09:16.493 --> 00:09:19.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though Haley spoke harshly to her,

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:22.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Celia was calm and listened to Haley.

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:25.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Haley explained how
she was feeling lonely,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing and caring for her grandmother,

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:32.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can see the love and concern
that Celia had for Haley,

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:36.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though just moments before
she had spoken really harshly to her.

00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, besides taking time
to think things through,

00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:45.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also need to remember
that it is Jehovah’s opinion of us

00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
that matters the most.

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:51.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s an important point,
especially when we deal

00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:54.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
with misunderstandings
or false accusations.

00:09:56.199 --> 00:10:00.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it:
Jehovah is an eyewitness to everything.

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate that, I want you to imagine

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
you had a traffic accident.

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:09.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you were just sitting at the stop sign,

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:13.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
but another car ran straight into you.

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:16.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
The police come,
and the person that ran into you

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that you ran into them,
and the police believe them.

00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:25.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take the matter to court.

00:10:25.061 --> 00:10:29.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
The judge listens as the other person
says that you ran into them;

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
however, before you can say anything,

00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:37.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge says:
“No, that is not what happened.

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:41.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was there walking on the sidewalk
across the street that day,

00:10:41.119 --> 00:10:43.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I saw the whole thing.”

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:48.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s extremely unlikely
that you can go to court and expect

00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:51.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge for your case
to have been an eyewitness.

00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:55.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
This does illustrate, though,
the peace of mind that we can have

00:10:55.217 --> 00:10:59.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that Jehovah is an eyewitness
to all that happens.

00:11:00.764 --> 00:11:04.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when falsely accused
or when we have a misunderstanding

00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:09.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we cannot seem to clear up,
it is of great comfort for us to know

00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:14.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was there that day
and saw the whole thing.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t need to take offense
at every negative thing

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:22.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is said or done around us

00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:26.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
or feel we have to defend ourselves
as being right on every occasion.

00:11:27.707 --> 00:11:30.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would surely wear out emotionally

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:34.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and probably not have very many friends.

00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:41.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be willing
to overlook minor transgressions.

00:11:41.054 --> 00:11:45.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at Proverbs 19:11

00:11:45.934 --> 00:11:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 19:11.

00:11:49.145 --> 00:11:52.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us?

00:11:52.148 --> 00:11:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The insight of a man
certainly slows down his anger,

00:11:57.153 --> 00:12:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is beauty on his part
to overlook an offense.”

00:12:03.577 --> 00:12:07.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
So can you “overlook an offense”?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the proverb said,
that ‘is beauty on our part.’

00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:14.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
If not and you have
a serious cause for complaint,

00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
handle matters
according to Jehovah’s direction.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show insight.

00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:24.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slow down any anger.

00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:27.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think carefully, and listen patiently

00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:30.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure you clearly have all the facts

00:12:30.854 --> 00:12:33.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
before you become offended
or take action.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that piece of paper
that you had in your hands

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:40.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got blown away by the wind?

00:12:40.614 --> 00:12:44.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if it was a hundred-dollar bill?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you would make every effort

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:50.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue it and get it back
because it’s valuable.

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:55.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our peace with our brothers
is far more valuable than paper money.

00:12:55.462 --> 00:12:58.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our peace
with our brothers or sisters

00:12:58.006 --> 00:13:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
is blown away
by misunderstandings, mistakes, or sin,

00:13:02.218 --> 00:13:06.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we should pursue peace
and try hard to get it back.

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:12.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we glorify God and promote peace

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:15.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we avoid quickly taking offense.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:27.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’
. . . By Apologizing.”

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:38.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am so sorry.”

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:42.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s my fault, please forgive me.”

00:13:42.384 --> 00:13:44.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how we phrase it,

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:47.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be difficult to apologize.

00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:49.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that so challenging?

00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:51.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many reasons:

00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:55.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may fear confrontation,
blame, or rejection.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we feel embarrassed,
and we’re too proud to apologize.

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:04.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may reason, ‘Apologizing will not undo
the blunder I’ve already made.’

00:14:04.239 --> 00:14:07.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it may even be that we are angry.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is such a matter of concern

00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:14.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “in July 2000,

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:18.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the California State Legislature
in the United States

00:14:18.378 --> 00:14:22.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“passed a bill designed
to relieve people of liability

00:14:22.132 --> 00:14:25.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if they express sympathy to an individual
who was injured in an accident

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:28.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in which they
themselves were involved. . . .

00:14:28.763 --> 00:14:32.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was noted that . . . people
often hesitate to extend an apology

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[out of concern that]
it could be construed in court

00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:38.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an admission of guilt.”

00:14:38.898 --> 00:14:42.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible provides an account
of a faithful servant,

00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:44.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul,

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:48.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was a good example
of one who apologized.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account is
in the book of Acts chapter 23.

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:56.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
The setting: A Roman military officer

00:14:56.541 --> 00:15:00.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanted to know why Paul
was being accused by the Jews.

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:05.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he brought Paul
to the Jewish chief priests

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commanded the Sanhedrin,
the high court, to assemble.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:13.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read Acts 23:1-5 together,

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:16.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t help but be impressed

00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:20.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Paul’s boldness
as he stands for what is right.

00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:24.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the same time,
please take note of his humility.

00:15:25.987 --> 00:15:30.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 23:1: “Looking intently
at the Sanhedrin,

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:34.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul said: ‘Men, brothers,

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:36.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have behaved before God

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:40.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with a perfectly clear conscience
down to this day.’

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:42.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this the high priest Ananias

00:15:42.712 --> 00:15:46.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ordered those standing by him
to strike him on the mouth.

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Paul said to him:

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:52.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God is going to strike you,
you whitewashed wall.

00:15:52.722 --> 00:15:55.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do you sit to judge me according to the Law

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:57.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and at the same time violate the Law

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by commanding me to be struck?’

00:16:00.563 --> 00:16:02.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those standing by said:

00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:06.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are you insulting the high priest of God?’

00:16:07.737 --> 00:16:10.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Paul said: ‘Brothers,

00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:13.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I did not know he was high priest.

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:16.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For it is written,
“You must not speak injuriously

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a ruler of your people.”’”

00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:23.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul immediately admitted his error.

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:25.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
What he had said,

00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:29.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the one appointed as judge
should not resort to violence, was right.

00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:32.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he apologized.

00:16:33.638 --> 00:16:35.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:16:35.932 --> 00:16:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will see an older sister

00:16:37.934 --> 00:16:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
applying the inspired words of Titus 2:3-5

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:46.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to advise younger sisters
“to be sound in mind.”

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will also observe
how one of the younger sisters

00:16:50.154 --> 00:16:53.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
avoids further problems
and pursues peace

00:16:53.908 --> 00:16:55.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
by humbly apologizing.

00:17:05.128 --> 00:17:07.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how this happened

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:13.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, Haley, I’m sorry.

00:17:13.219 --> 00:17:15.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hurts me to see you so upset.

00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:23.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t believe you two.

00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:25.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
First,

00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:28.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you heard

00:17:29.444 --> 00:17:33.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not what I said.

00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:35.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I thought that was how you felt.

00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:41.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if I got that part wrong,
all this drama?

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:42.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now stop!

00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:46.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, girls.

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:49.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, come closer.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:04.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.”

00:18:09.817 --> 00:18:12.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not jealous.

00:18:17.992 --> 00:18:19.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t become provoked,

00:18:19.994 --> 00:18:22.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when things become difficult.

00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:27.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are we going to do?

00:18:31.714 --> 00:18:33.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought if—

00:18:36.928 --> 00:18:38.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:42.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, Haley.

00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:49.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:18:50.024 --> 00:18:52.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you so harshly.

00:18:54.445 --> 00:18:56.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you at all.

00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:05.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m sorry for dragging you into this
by twisting what you said.

00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:11.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK; things happen.

00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:13.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been on both ends.

00:19:20.471 --> 00:19:24.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should never have spoken
that way to you, Celia

00:19:26.978 --> 00:19:31.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I mean, to either of you.

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to get home to Nana.

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:45.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll call you tomorrow.

00:19:45.788 --> 00:19:47.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:19:51.627 --> 00:19:56.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
The older sister apologized,
even though she was not in the wrong.

00:19:56.382 --> 00:20:01.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also urged
the two younger sisters to make peace.

00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:05.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes courage, humility,
and determination to apologize.

00:20:06.768 --> 00:20:09.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting to note what’s stated

00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:13.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 2:3:

00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means our determined effort
is not to win an argument,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
which could be contentious,

00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:35.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor do we want to start a discussion

00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:40.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the primary thought being
that we are in the right.

00:20:40.093 --> 00:20:44.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
That could mean
that we are self-concerned, or egotistical.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, in harmony
with the principle of that scripture

00:20:48.976 --> 00:20:52.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to act with humility.

00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:55.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our aim should be to pursue peace.

00:20:55.775 --> 00:21:00.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we think the other person
is being unreasonable,

00:21:00.196 --> 00:21:02.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
we apologize.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it so important to do so?

00:21:05.868 --> 00:21:10.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that is what makes
our worship to Jehovah acceptable.

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:13.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew chapter 5,

00:21:13.835 --> 00:21:16.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 23, 24,

00:21:16.629 --> 00:21:18.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus makes it very clear:

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:26.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, then, you are bringing
your gift to the altar

00:21:26.264 --> 00:21:30.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and there you remember
that your brother has something against you,

00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:34.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“leave your gift there
in front of the altar,

00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:36.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and go away.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“First make your peace with your brother,

00:21:40.153 --> 00:21:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then come back and offer your gift.”

00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One Bible scholar
describes the scene this way:

00:21:51.247 --> 00:21:54.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The worshipper has entered the Temple;

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:56.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘he has passed through [a] series of courts,

00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:58.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the Court of the Gentiles,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the Court of the Women,
the Court of the Men.

00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:06.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Beyond that there lay
the Court of the Priests

00:22:06.053 --> 00:22:08.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘into which the layman could not go.

00:22:08.973 --> 00:22:11.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The worshipper is standing at the rail,

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:15.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ready to hand over
his [living animal] to the priest.’ . . .

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:18.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that [critical] moment,

00:22:18.357 --> 00:22:22.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
the worshipper remembers
that his brother has something against him.”

00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he to do?

00:22:26.115 --> 00:22:29.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Leave your gift there
in front of the altar,”

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:33.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus explains, “and go away.”

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jesus say is more important
than offering up a sacrifice?

00:22:39.253 --> 00:22:43.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘First, make peace with your brother.

00:22:43.674 --> 00:22:47.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Then when you have come back,

00:22:47.094 --> 00:22:49.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer up your gift.’

00:22:49.555 --> 00:22:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expression rendered “make your peace”

00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:55.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “to reconcile.”

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:59.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words teach a crucial lesson:

00:22:59.106 --> 00:23:01.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reconciliation, or peace,

00:23:01.317 --> 00:23:04.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes before sacrifice.

00:23:04.654 --> 00:23:07.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way we treat fellow worshippers

00:23:07.448 --> 00:23:10.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a direct bearing
on our relationship with God.

00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:15.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 4:20 pointedly says:

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:19.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the one who does not love his brother,
whom he has seen,

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:23.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot love God,
whom he has not seen.”

00:23:24.507 --> 00:23:29.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves in a situation
where we have offended a fellow worshipper,

00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:31.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to apply Jesus’ counsel.

00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:34.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to take the initiative

00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:36.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
to approach our brother or sister.

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:39.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may need
to acknowledge their hurt feelings.

00:23:39.772 --> 00:23:44.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may also need to ask,
“What can I do to make amends?”

00:23:44.318 --> 00:23:48.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often a sincere apology
is all that is needed.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although our worship today
no longer includes animal sacrifices,

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:56.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jesus was teaching

00:23:56.414 --> 00:23:59.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
emphasizes that there is a connection

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
between peace with our brother

00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:05.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and acceptable worship to God.

00:24:05.881 --> 00:24:08.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
When two humans are at odds,

00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:11.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may be a measure
of blame on both sides,

00:24:11.137 --> 00:24:14.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
since both are imperfect and prone to error.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
This usually calls for mutual concessions.

00:24:18.853 --> 00:24:22.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if only the one apologizing is right,

00:24:22.815 --> 00:24:26.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
the issue is not so much
who is right and who is wrong

00:24:26.527 --> 00:24:30.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
but who will take the initiative
to make peace.

00:24:31.824 --> 00:24:35.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul heard
that the Christians in Corinth

00:24:35.077 --> 00:24:37.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
were taking fellow servants of God

00:24:37.788 --> 00:24:40.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
to secular courts over personal differences,

00:24:40.541 --> 00:24:42.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said:

00:24:42.793 --> 00:24:45.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why [do you] not
rather let [yourself] be wronged?

00:24:45.963 --> 00:24:49.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you not
rather let [yourself] be defrauded?”

00:24:50.843 --> 00:24:52.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principle is clear.

00:24:52.928 --> 00:24:57.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace among fellow believers
is more important than proving

00:24:57.141 --> 00:24:59.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is right and who is wrong.

00:25:01.228 --> 00:25:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping this in mind makes it easier
to apologize for a wrong

00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:08.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
that someone thinks
we’ve committed against him or her.

00:25:08.277 --> 00:25:11.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
A heartfelt apology can open the way

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a constructive conversation.

00:25:13.783 --> 00:25:16.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can minimize problems

00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:18.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restore peace.

00:25:20.247 --> 00:25:22.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Leonard Myers,

00:25:22.249 --> 00:25:24.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:28.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:25:28.172 --> 00:25:30.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’ . . .

00:25:30.216 --> 00:25:32.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
By Forgiving Freely.”

00:25:40.309 --> 00:25:43.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a simple fact
that to be at peace with others,

00:25:43.437 --> 00:25:46.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be willing to forgive.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice two examples:

00:25:49.193 --> 00:25:52.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
A father and his teenage daughter
didn’t get along.

00:25:52.363 --> 00:25:56.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Minor disagreements often developed
into shouting matches.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, the tension got so bad

00:25:58.911 --> 00:26:01.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the daughter was asked
to leave the house.

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:05.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, she recognized
that she was at fault

00:26:05.376 --> 00:26:08.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked for her father’s forgiveness.

00:26:08.629 --> 00:26:11.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
But instead of overlooking her mistakes,

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
her father rejected her efforts.

00:26:13.801 --> 00:26:17.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was unwilling to extend forgiveness
to his own daughter.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s contrast that
with another example.

00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:26.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
A blameless man was condemned to die
for a crime he didn’t commit.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly before he died,
the innocent man stated:

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Father, forgive them,

00:26:33.737 --> 00:26:37.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:26:37.116 --> 00:26:41.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words of Jesus
are recorded at Luke 23:34,

00:26:41.662 --> 00:26:44.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he may have been referring
to the Roman soldiers

00:26:44.415 --> 00:26:47.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
who drove the nails into his hands and feet

00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:50.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who didn’t know who he really was.

00:26:50.004 --> 00:26:52.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Jesus may have had in mind
some in the crowd

00:26:52.631 --> 00:26:54.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
who demanded his execution

00:26:54.633 --> 00:26:57.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
but would later exercise faith in him.

00:26:57.553 --> 00:27:02.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jesus
was willing to forgive freely.

00:27:03.976 --> 00:27:07.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we measure up
with regard to forgiveness?

00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:11.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we like Jesus,
willing to forgive others freely?

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:16.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or at times, do we tend to be more
like the man who was unwilling to forgive?

00:27:18.741 --> 00:27:21.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Granting forgiveness isn’t always easy.

00:27:21.327 --> 00:27:24.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imperfection exerts
a powerful influence over us,

00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:27.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes robbing us of compassion.

00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:29.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
When someone hurts us,

00:27:29.543 --> 00:27:33.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may become resentful, or hold a grudge.

00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:37.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps some of us
were taught not to forgive others.

00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:41.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little wonder that cultivating
a peaceful, forgiving spirit

00:27:41.972 --> 00:27:43.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be difficult.

00:27:43.974 --> 00:27:48.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, the Bible encourages us
to forgive freely.

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:54.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider another example
of forgiveness in the man Job.

00:27:54.568 --> 00:27:56.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re familiar with his trials:

00:27:56.612 --> 00:27:59.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of his possessions and ten children,

00:27:59.114 --> 00:28:03.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
a loathsome disease,
and his wife told him to curse God and die.

00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:06.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three companions heard
about Job’s calamities,

00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:09.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they agreed to go comfort him.

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:13.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job 2:13 states that when they arrived,

00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:16.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they sat . . . with him
for seven days and seven nights,”

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:19.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they didn’t say “a word to him.”

00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:21.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe that was a good thing

00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:23.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
because when they finally opened
their mouths,

00:28:23.264 --> 00:28:27.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
they deeply hurt Job
with their baseless accusations.

00:28:28.477 --> 00:28:30.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice something interesting
about this account.

00:28:30.854 --> 00:28:33.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Job chapter 42.

00:28:34.775 --> 00:28:37.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of Job’s trials, Jehovah asked Job

00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:40.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something
regarding these false accusers.

00:28:40.739 --> 00:28:45.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice Jehovah’s words there at Job 42,
the <i>B </i> portion of verse 8:

00:28:47.454 --> 00:28:51.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And my servant Job will pray for you.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will surely accept his request

00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:57.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to deal with you
according to your foolishness.”

00:28:57.464 --> 00:29:01.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
that after all the false accusations,

00:29:01.302 --> 00:29:05.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah asked Job to pray
for the men who had tormented him?

00:29:05.806 --> 00:29:08.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, would Job tell Jehovah,

00:29:08.267 --> 00:29:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, after what they said to me,
I’m not going to forgive them”?

00:29:13.022 --> 00:29:15.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Job be resentful?

00:29:15.858 --> 00:29:18.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the latter portion of verse 9:

00:29:19.945 --> 00:29:24.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jehovah accepted Job’s prayer.”

00:29:24.074 --> 00:29:27.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job followed Jehovah’s instructions.

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:32.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result
of Job’s integrity and his forgiving spirit?

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:34.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10:

00:29:34.209 --> 00:29:37.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After Job had prayed for his companions,

00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:41.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah removed Job’s tribulation
and restored his prosperity.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:45.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave him double what he had before.”

00:29:45.429 --> 00:29:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account goes on to say
that Job had ten more children.

00:29:48.724 --> 00:29:51.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lived for 140 more years,

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 17 states:

00:29:53.937 --> 00:29:58.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Finally Job died,
after a long and satisfying life.”

00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:01.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job was blessed for his forgiving spirit,

00:30:01.612 --> 00:30:05.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he set a good example for us
to forgive freely.

00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:09.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization
with Celia and Haley,

00:30:09.995 --> 00:30:13.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice why Haley finally decides
to forgive freely.

00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:41.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, it’s me.

00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:43.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been thinking of you.

00:30:44.697 --> 00:30:46.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great broadcast.

00:30:46.407 --> 00:30:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you like the new original song?

00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:50.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give us a call.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wish she’d give it a rest.

00:31:12.891 --> 00:31:13.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:31:13.767 --> 00:31:15.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, it’s just Emily
for the millionth time.

00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:22.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the problem, love?

00:31:22.693 --> 00:31:25.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no problem.

00:31:25.362 --> 00:31:26.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just . . .

00:31:30.284 --> 00:31:32.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . difficult to let her back in?

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:48.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not that simple?

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:51.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not that simple.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to forgive . . .

00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:59.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . but not get burned again.

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:05.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind

00:32:05.068 --> 00:32:08.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t want to miss that opportunity.

00:32:15.496 --> 00:32:17.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never thought about it like that.

00:32:19.208 --> 00:32:23.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time
when you wanted forgiveness

00:32:26.298 --> 00:32:28.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when it meant everything.

00:32:29.968 --> 00:32:31.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did it feel?

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . just like your Nana does as well.

00:32:33.013 --> 00:32:34.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
She really deeply cares about you.

00:32:34.223 --> 00:32:36.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
You feel awful

00:32:38.185 --> 00:32:40.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ve let everyone down.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re very precious.

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:45.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:32:50.572 --> 00:32:52.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they forgive you,

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:57.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suddenly everything is OK.

00:33:07.589 --> 00:33:11.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily, sorry I haven’t been back to you.

00:33:13.887 --> 00:33:15.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have plans for tomorrow?

00:33:18.725 --> 00:33:21.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
What good reasoning on the part of Celia!

00:33:21.728 --> 00:33:25.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the expression
that really touched Haley’s heart?

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:30.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t want to miss that opportunity.”

00:33:33.574 --> 00:33:37.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we’ve been wronged,
we don’t want to miss the opportunity

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:41.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
to imitate Jehovah by forgiving freely.

00:33:41.331 --> 00:33:45.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice how this is highlighted
at Colossians 3:13.

00:33:46.628 --> 00:33:49.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we considered Job’s example,
remember that Jehovah

00:33:49.464 --> 00:33:51.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
instructed him to pray for his companions.

00:33:51.842 --> 00:33:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that helped Job
display a forgiving spirit.

00:33:55.137 --> 00:33:59.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice here what Jehovah
instructs us to do at Colossians 3:13:

00:34:00.767 --> 00:34:02.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue putting up with one another

00:34:02.978 --> 00:34:06.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and forgiving one another freely

00:34:06.189 --> 00:34:10.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if anyone has a cause for complaint
against another.

00:34:10.068 --> 00:34:13.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:34:13.113 --> 00:34:16.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must also do the same.”

00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:20.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek verb used here for “freely forgive”

00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:22.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
is related to a word often rendered

00:34:22.748 --> 00:34:26.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“undeserved kindness” or “favor.”

00:34:26.084 --> 00:34:28.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
When used in the sense of forgiving,

00:34:28.211 --> 00:34:30.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
this verb conveys the idea of doing so

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:33.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
freely, generously

00:34:33.425 --> 00:34:37.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just as when you, out of generosity,
give a gift to someone.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:43.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah requires that we
freely forgive others in imitation of him.

00:34:43.852 --> 00:34:45.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the end of the verse?

00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:49.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You <i>must</i>  also do the same.”

00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:54.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if the offense is minor,
it’s best to overlook it.

00:34:54.279 --> 00:34:56.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 13:5 states

00:34:56.865 --> 00:35:00.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
that love “does not keep account
of the injury.”

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:02.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Proverbs 19:11 tells us

00:35:02.746 --> 00:35:06.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “it is beauty . . .
to overlook an offense.”

00:35:07.751 --> 00:35:11.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, if we feel that we need to talk
to our brother or sister

00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:13.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
about an offense that was committed
against us,

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:16.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the best way to handle that?

00:35:16.301 --> 00:35:20.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we should ask Jehovah in prayer
for his guidance.

00:35:20.472 --> 00:35:23.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then with the brother’s good qualities
in mind,

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
graciously tell him
that we want to make peace.

00:35:26.895 --> 00:35:30.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen carefully and empathetically.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
We shouldn’t interrupt, even if we
don’t agree with everything being said.

00:35:35.195 --> 00:35:39.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be that his viewpoint is wrong,
but it is his viewpoint.

00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:45.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when it’s our turn to speak,
we want to be gracious.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell the brother
what we appreciate about him;

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:51.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
apologize for any part that we played
in the misunderstanding.

00:35:52.754 --> 00:35:57.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our humble efforts result in good,
thank Jehovah.

00:35:57.092 --> 00:36:00.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they don’t,
keep asking Jehovah for guidance

00:36:00.512 --> 00:36:03.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
while we look for another opportunity
to make peace.

00:36:05.267 --> 00:36:07.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we truly forgive,

00:36:07.269 --> 00:36:10.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make a heartfelt decision
to let go of resentment.

00:36:10.689 --> 00:36:13.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what peace that can bring us!

00:36:13.942 --> 00:36:17.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, forgiving doesn’t mean
that we approve of a wrong action,

00:36:17.612 --> 00:36:21.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider it unimportant,
or pretend it didn’t happen.

00:36:21.491 --> 00:36:25.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, if we’ve been treated unjustly
and have a cause for complaint,

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:29.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do what we can to pursue peace
and resolve the matter.

00:36:29.249 --> 00:36:32.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we confidently leave it
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:38.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, what will you
take away from this consideration?

00:36:38.341 --> 00:36:43.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree that it can be
a challenge at times to forgive.

00:36:43.138 --> 00:36:45.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather than be like the man
we spoke of earlier

00:36:45.932 --> 00:36:48.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
who refused to forgive his own daughter,

00:36:48.727 --> 00:36:53.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
may we follow the examples of Jehovah,
Jesus, Job, and Haley

00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:57.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving freely, generously.

00:36:57.277 --> 00:37:00.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, a chance to forgive

00:37:00.113 --> 00:37:02.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a chance to imitate Jehovah,

00:37:02.616 --> 00:37:05.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we wouldn’t want to miss
that opportunity.

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:08.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us pursue peace

00:37:08.455 --> 00:37:11.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being willing to forgive freely.

00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:16.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:18.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the final talk
of this symposium,

00:37:18.924 --> 00:37:23.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’ . . .
By Using Our Gift of Speech Wisely.”

00:37:32.395 --> 00:37:36.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it challenging
to use our gift of speech wisely?

00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:42.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because something powerful
constantly works against us.

00:37:42.114 --> 00:37:44.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:37:44.116 --> 00:37:46.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imperfection.

00:37:46.159 --> 00:37:48.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tongue is powerful.

00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:51.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can do much good,
but because of imperfection,

00:37:51.832 --> 00:37:55.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can also cause much harm.

00:37:55.502 --> 00:38:00.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
This thought is well expressed
in the Bible book of Proverbs.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Proverbs 12:18 says:

00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:09.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thoughtless speech
is like the stabs of a sword,

00:38:09.724 --> 00:38:14.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the tongue of the wise is a healing.”

00:38:14.312 --> 00:38:17.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Proverbs 18:21 states:

00:38:17.649 --> 00:38:21.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death and life
are in the power of the tongue;

00:38:21.778 --> 00:38:26.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who love to use it
will eat its fruitage.”

00:38:27.742 --> 00:38:30.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Words have power,

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we need to be careful about what we say

00:38:33.915 --> 00:38:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we say it.

00:38:36.626 --> 00:38:41.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can recall
when someone spoke unkindly to you

00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:43.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hurt you deeply.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, thoughtful speech

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:51.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
can mend an aching heart
and heal friendships.

00:38:51.224 --> 00:38:54.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of imperfection,
we all have difficulty

00:38:54.352 --> 00:38:56.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
controlling our tongue.

00:38:56.688 --> 00:39:01.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was true
even of the first-century disciple James.

00:39:02.277 --> 00:39:06.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly acknowledged the challenge
that all humans face

00:39:06.573 --> 00:39:10.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the third chapter of his inspired letter.

00:39:10.827 --> 00:39:13.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how James described this

00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:18.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
at James 3:3-6, 8:

00:39:20.128 --> 00:39:23.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we put bridles in the mouths of horses

00:39:23.757 --> 00:39:25.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make them obey us,

00:39:25.759 --> 00:39:29.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we guide also the whole body.

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:33.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look also at ships: Although they are so big

00:39:33.099 --> 00:39:35.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and are driven by strong winds,

00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:39.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they are steered by a very small rudder

00:39:39.481 --> 00:39:43.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wherever the man at the helm
is inclined to go.

00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:47.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, too, the tongue
is a small part of the body,

00:39:47.781 --> 00:39:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and yet it makes great brags.

00:39:50.867 --> 00:39:53.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“See how small a fire it takes

00:39:53.286 --> 00:39:56.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to set a great forest ablaze!

00:39:56.331 --> 00:39:59.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tongue is also a fire.

00:39:59.251 --> 00:40:02.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tongue represents a world
of unrighteousness

00:40:02.212 --> 00:40:05.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“among our body members,
for it defiles

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all the body
and sets the whole course of life on fire,

00:40:09.594 --> 00:40:12.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is set on fire by Gehenna.”

00:40:13.848 --> 00:40:18.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 8:
“But no human can tame the tongue.

00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:21.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is unruly and injurious,

00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:23.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
full of deadly poison.”

00:40:23.942 --> 00:40:26.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to inherited imperfection,

00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:30.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
our upbringing could also be a factor.

00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:35.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of September 15, 2006,

00:40:35.245 --> 00:40:40.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 21, paragraph 6 states:

00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:43.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In addition to human imperfection,

00:40:43.628 --> 00:40:48.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“family environment plays a role
in the misuse of the tongue.

00:40:48.508 --> 00:40:50.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some people were raised in homes

00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:53.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where parents were ‘not open
to any agreement, . . .

00:40:53.722 --> 00:40:56.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
without self-control, fierce.’”

00:40:58.768 --> 00:41:02.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite such challenges,
it is possible for each one of us

00:41:02.564 --> 00:41:05.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “seek peace and pursue it.”

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus set a good example

00:41:09.154 --> 00:41:12.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
in using the gift of speech wisely.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:17.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used his speech to encourage
and comfort others.

00:41:17.412 --> 00:41:20.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
While on earth, he applied to himself
the words

00:41:20.582 --> 00:41:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Isaiah 61:1,

00:41:24.294 --> 00:41:26.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
which states the following:

00:41:28.214 --> 00:41:31.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
is upon me,

00:41:31.801 --> 00:41:36.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because Jehovah anointed me
to declare good news to the meek.

00:41:36.723 --> 00:41:39.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,

00:41:39.893 --> 00:41:42.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim liberty to the captives

00:41:42.437 --> 00:41:46.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the wide opening of the eyes
to the prisoners.”

00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:51.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
As recorded at Matthew 12:20,
Matthew applies the words

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:56.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Isaiah 42:1-3 to Jesus.

00:41:56.743 --> 00:41:59.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 12:20, he stated:

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No bruised reed will he crush,

00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:06.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and no smoldering wick will he extinguish,

00:42:06.544 --> 00:42:10.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
until he brings justice with success.”

00:42:11.383 --> 00:42:14.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learn an important lesson
from such verses.

00:42:14.886 --> 00:42:18.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus recognized that the tongue has power

00:42:18.515 --> 00:42:21.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
—power to harm and power to heal.

00:42:23.186 --> 00:42:28.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of February 15, 2015,

00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:32.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 13, and paragraph 11, thus stated

00:42:32.612 --> 00:42:35.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jesus showed discernment

00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:38.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all he said and did.”

00:42:39.911 --> 00:42:43.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we imitate Jesus more closely?

00:42:43.456 --> 00:42:48.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, what will you do
the next time an opportunity arises

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you to use your gift of speech wisely?

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:55.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how the wise use of the tongue
helps to heal.

00:43:06.354 --> 00:43:08.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just need a bit of help.

00:43:08.064 --> 00:43:10.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think I should do
for my winter collection?

00:43:10.817 --> 00:43:14.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I don’t know,
but I love what you did with your new stuff,

00:43:14.946 --> 00:43:16.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially

00:43:18.616 --> 00:43:20.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
this set.

00:43:20.452 --> 00:43:22.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks.

00:43:23.288 --> 00:43:25.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve all given me so many great ideas.

00:43:25.874 --> 00:43:28.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you make them.

00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:29.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:43:29.794 --> 00:43:31.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, girls.

00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:35.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
You love it.

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:39.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, this is my song.

00:43:39.345 --> 00:43:41.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mine too.

00:43:41.347 --> 00:43:44.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have a treasured place

00:43:44.225 --> 00:43:46.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in Jehovah’s house;

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:49.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’ll help you out [out].

00:43:49.856 --> 00:43:50.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you have . . .”

00:43:50.732 --> 00:43:52.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, I sing like a crow.

00:43:52.692 --> 00:43:54.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, stop!

00:43:55.528 --> 00:43:59.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll tell you who else thinks it’s her song,
but you’d better have earplugs handy

00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Veronica.

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:05.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness!
She’s in love with her own voice.

00:44:06.789 --> 00:44:08.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ever sit near her at the hall?

00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:11.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like she’s the only one that can sing.

00:44:11.419 --> 00:44:12.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she’s such a diva.

00:44:12.629 --> 00:44:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
My first thought:
‘Oh, no! Here we go again!

00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:20.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen this movie before.’

00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:22.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:44:26.142 --> 00:44:28.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems it’s all about Haley.

00:44:28.436 --> 00:44:31.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:44:35.235 --> 00:44:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve lived it.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s a case of her being more careful
how she comes across,

00:44:43.826 --> 00:44:45.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s another matter.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she suggest?

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:51.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I should tell her
that she needs to stop.

00:44:51.251 --> 00:44:53.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:44:53.253 --> 00:44:56.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially as a pioneer,
what kind of example is she setting?

00:44:56.881 --> 00:44:59.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
How quickly it snowballs out of control!

00:44:59.592 --> 00:45:00.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:45:00.802 --> 00:45:02.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:05.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! I can’t believe you.

00:45:05.098 --> 00:45:08.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:45:11.229 --> 00:45:12.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley!

00:45:16.442 --> 00:45:19.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
How difficult it can be to unravel!

00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:23.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:45:24.033 --> 00:45:26.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you so harshly.

00:45:28.288 --> 00:45:30.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you at all.

00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:35.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
A chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:45:36.004 --> 00:45:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time
when you wanted forgiveness.

00:45:47.307 --> 00:45:51.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has anyone ever tried talking to her
about her singing?

00:45:55.273 --> 00:45:57.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what I love about Veronica?

00:45:57.775 --> 00:46:01.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s probably the most hospitable person
I know.

00:46:01.195 --> 00:46:03.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always open house at her place.

00:46:03.364 --> 00:46:05.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can she cook!

00:46:05.658 --> 00:46:06.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you tried her curry?

00:46:06.784 --> 00:46:07.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t tried it yet.

00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:09.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s so good.

00:46:09.078 --> 00:46:10.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so good.

00:46:10.455 --> 00:46:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really look forward to that.

00:46:12.582 --> 00:46:13.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really good.

00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:14.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, I’ll ask her.

00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:17.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does these curry nights.

00:46:17.503 --> 00:46:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you’re going to love it.

00:46:21.299 --> 00:46:23.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should use our gift of speech

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:26.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
to honor God and to benefit others.

00:46:26.888 --> 00:46:30.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if somebody gets angry at us,

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:34.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
our mild reply can diffuse the situation.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Proverbs 15:1 says:

00:46:37.023 --> 00:46:40.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A mild answer turns away rage,

00:46:40.026 --> 00:46:44.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a harsh word stirs up anger.”

00:46:44.155 --> 00:46:46.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also use our gift of speech

00:46:46.658 --> 00:46:49.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
to console and encourage others.

00:46:50.578 --> 00:46:55.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 5:11, 14 states:

00:46:56.584 --> 00:47:01.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, keep encouraging one another
and building one another up,

00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:05.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you are in fact doing. . . .

00:47:05.051 --> 00:47:08.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the other hand, we urge you, brothers,

00:47:08.137 --> 00:47:11.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to warn the disorderly, speak consolingly

00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:13.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who are depressed,

00:47:13.643 --> 00:47:17.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
support the weak, be patient toward all.”

00:47:18.398 --> 00:47:21.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even faithful servants of Jehovah

00:47:21.025 --> 00:47:24.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
may at times struggle with depression.

00:47:24.362 --> 00:47:27.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we help such ones?

00:47:27.448 --> 00:47:30.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offer specific, genuine commendation

00:47:30.952 --> 00:47:35.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them see their own value
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:47:35.623 --> 00:47:39.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Share with them the powerful words
of Bible texts

00:47:39.335 --> 00:47:42.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing that Jehovah
truly cares about and loves those

00:47:42.839 --> 00:47:46.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
who “are broken at heart”
and “crushed in spirit.”

00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:50.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also use the power of our tongue

00:47:50.304 --> 00:47:53.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide much needed encouragement
to others.

00:47:55.351 --> 00:47:59.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has a fellow believer lost
a loved one in death?

00:47:59.522 --> 00:48:03.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sympathetic words
expressing our care and concern

00:48:03.651 --> 00:48:07.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
can comfort a grieving heart.

00:48:07.321 --> 00:48:11.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is an elderly brother or sister
feeling unneeded?

00:48:11.617 --> 00:48:15.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
A thoughtful tongue can reassure older ones

00:48:15.121 --> 00:48:18.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are valued and appreciated.

00:48:19.417 --> 00:48:23.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is someone struggling with a chronic illness?

00:48:23.129 --> 00:48:26.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind words shared on the phone or in person

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:31.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
can do much to lift the spirits
of one who is sick.

00:48:32.764 --> 00:48:34.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
How pleased our Creator must be

00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:38.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we use the power of speech
to utter sayings

00:48:38.436 --> 00:48:40.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are “good for building up”!

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:45.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not be able to fix their problems,

00:48:45.151 --> 00:48:48.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can let them know that we love them

00:48:48.029 --> 00:48:50.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we care about them.

00:48:51.324 --> 00:48:56.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you can arrange
to spend time with him or her.

00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:58.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we can use God’s Word

00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:01.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen them.

00:49:01.626 --> 00:49:04.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you may notice
that someone in the congregation

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
is discouraged or depressed.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could read an encouraging Bible verse

00:49:09.967 --> 00:49:13.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even offer to say a prayer.

00:49:13.054 --> 00:49:15.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reassure such ones

00:49:15.056 --> 00:49:19.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
that their brothers and sisters
in the congregation love them.

00:49:20.102 --> 00:49:22.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
And speak in a way that shows

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you really mean and believe
what you say.

00:49:27.401 --> 00:49:30.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium has given each one of us

00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:33.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
much to think about, has it not?

00:49:33.825 --> 00:49:38.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been reminded
that seeking peace is not always easy.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have also learned
that the pursuit of peace

00:49:41.958 --> 00:49:44.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires effort.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what specific ways are you resolved

00:49:48.214 --> 00:49:51.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “seek peace and pursue it”

00:49:51.175 --> 00:49:53.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the days ahead?

00:49:53.886 --> 00:49:57.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue to pursue peace

00:49:57.765 --> 00:50:02.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) by not quickly taking offense,

00:50:02.228 --> 00:50:05.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) by apologizing,

00:50:05.648 --> 00:50:08.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) by forgiving freely,

00:50:08.901 --> 00:50:13.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (4) by using our gift of speech wisely

00:50:13.322 --> 00:50:16.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage and comfort others.

00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:19.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may Jehovah, “the God of peace,”

00:50:19.787 --> 00:50:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
bless you abundantly for doing so!

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers, for reminding us

00:50:26.961 --> 00:50:30.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the peace we enjoy
does not happen by chance.

00:50:30.464 --> 00:50:34.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
It requires continuous effort on our part,

00:50:34.218 --> 00:50:37.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can succeed with Jehovah’s help.

00:50:41.183 --> 00:50:44.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have now come
to the concluding talk of this session.

00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:50.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christians come from a variety
of backgrounds and cultures.

00:50:50.943 --> 00:50:54.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Individual consciences differ.

00:50:54.238 --> 00:50:56.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we remain united

00:50:56.741 --> 00:50:59.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite these differences?

00:50:59.785 --> 00:51:02.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please give your attention
to Brother David Splane,

00:51:02.955 --> 00:51:04.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:51:04.957 --> 00:51:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he delivers the talk entitled

00:51:07.877 --> 00:51:12.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Safeguard Our ‘Uniting Bond of Peace’!”

00:51:20.306 --> 00:51:22.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think of unity,

00:51:22.308 --> 00:51:25.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
the words of Psalm 133:1 may come to mind.

00:51:25.853 --> 00:51:27.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read them.

00:51:27.104 --> 00:51:29.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the words
aren’t going to be on the screen,

00:51:29.273 --> 00:51:31.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
so let’s look them up in the Bible.

00:51:31.776 --> 00:51:33.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:37.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Psalm 133

00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:39.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 1.

00:51:39.533 --> 00:51:41.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Look!

00:51:41.953 --> 00:51:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How good and how pleasant it is

00:51:44.747 --> 00:51:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:51:48.834 --> 00:51:53.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we certainly agree
with these words of David.

00:51:53.673 --> 00:51:58.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, speaking of David,
he knew the value of unity.

00:51:58.177 --> 00:52:01.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we may remember
that he didn’t always get

00:52:01.013 --> 00:52:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
to experience it in his own life.

00:52:03.391 --> 00:52:07.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beginning and the end
of his reign were marked by civil war

00:52:07.436 --> 00:52:10.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the very opposite of unity.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’d think it would have been easy

00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:15.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Israelites to remain united.

00:52:15.653 --> 00:52:18.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, they came from the same roots;

00:52:18.614 --> 00:52:21.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were all children of Abraham;

00:52:21.283 --> 00:52:24.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spoke a common language—Hebrew;

00:52:24.286 --> 00:52:28.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they came
from a similar social background.

00:52:28.499 --> 00:52:31.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their ancestors had all been slaves in Egypt.

00:52:31.168 --> 00:52:36.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there was no basis
for anybody to brag about his heritage.

00:52:36.048 --> 00:52:41.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, the Israelites
found reasons to hate one another.

00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:43.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel’s first king was from Benjamin.

00:52:43.597 --> 00:52:46.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its second king was from Judah.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:51.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was reason enough
to start a war in Israel.

00:52:51.063 --> 00:52:54.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s fast-forward now to the first century.

00:52:54.608 --> 00:52:58.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unity is so important
that it was on Jesus’ mind

00:52:58.404 --> 00:53:00.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the night before he died.

00:53:00.656 --> 00:53:02.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember that he prayed to his Father

00:53:02.908 --> 00:53:05.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his disciples ‘might be one

00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:09.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he and the Father are one.’

00:53:09.832 --> 00:53:12.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that could have been a challenge.

00:53:12.918 --> 00:53:14.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
From a human standpoint,

00:53:17.048 --> 00:53:20.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was no reason
for Jesus’ disciples to be united.

00:53:20.217 --> 00:53:22.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the Israelites,

00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:25.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not have a common ancestor,

00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:28.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not have a common mother tongue,

00:53:28.142 --> 00:53:32.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they came
from a variety of social backgrounds.

00:53:32.063 --> 00:53:37.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of it: The first Christians
were Jews or Jewish proselytes.

00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:41.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up, they were taught
that Gentiles were unclean,

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they wouldn’t even
enter the home of a Gentile,

00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:45.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
let alone preach to one.

00:53:47.036 --> 00:53:51.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for Gentile Christians,
they came “from every nation under heaven.”

00:53:51.999 --> 00:53:54.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of them knew nothing
of the Hebrew language

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:53:56.087 --> 00:53:58.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d worshipped false gods.

00:53:58.589 --> 00:54:02.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some had been highly educated at Athens,

00:54:02.218 --> 00:54:05.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alexandria, or some other
center of worldly wisdom.

00:54:05.721 --> 00:54:09.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others had little formal education.

00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:12.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, when they accepted the truth,

00:54:12.103 --> 00:54:15.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians became united
and at peace with one another.

00:54:17.191 --> 00:54:19.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul wanted to help them

00:54:19.485 --> 00:54:22.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
to safeguard that bond of peace.

00:54:22.863 --> 00:54:25.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s the theme
of our discussion this morning.

00:54:25.991 --> 00:54:27.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to look at his words

00:54:27.993 --> 00:54:32.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Ephesians 4:3-6,

00:54:32.873 --> 00:54:37.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going
to focus in on a particular expression

00:54:37.378 --> 00:54:40.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
in these verses.

00:54:40.214 --> 00:54:42.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Ephesians chapter 4.

00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:44.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians chapter 4

00:54:46.846 --> 00:54:50.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 3-6.

00:54:51.559 --> 00:54:55.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul is interested in unity here,

00:54:55.813 --> 00:54:59.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
so let’s see how he frames his discussion.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Earnestly endeavoring

00:55:02.862 --> 00:55:07.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so an effort is involved,
earnestly endeavoring]

00:55:07.324 --> 00:55:10.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to maintain the oneness of the spirit

00:55:10.327 --> 00:55:14.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the uniting bond of peace.

00:55:14.623 --> 00:55:18.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One body there is, and one spirit,

00:55:18.043 --> 00:55:21.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you were called
to the one hope of your calling;

00:55:21.255 --> 00:55:25.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and then he emphasizes]
one Lord, one faith,

00:55:25.176 --> 00:55:28.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one baptism; one God

00:55:28.304 --> 00:55:31.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Father of all.”

00:55:31.682 --> 00:55:34.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s go back to verse 3
and look at the expression

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:38.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the uniting bond of peace.”

00:55:38.689 --> 00:55:43.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our discussion
is “Safeguard Our ‘Uniting Bond of Peace’!”

00:55:43.694 --> 00:55:47.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Study Bible</i>
has an interesting note on that expression.

00:55:47.198 --> 00:55:52.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us that the word
translated “uniting bond”

00:55:52.036 --> 00:55:56.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be translated “ligament”
—ligament.

00:55:56.498 --> 00:56:00.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is translated
“ligament” in other verses.

00:56:00.586 --> 00:56:02.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know what a ligament is.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:07.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a band of strong tissue
that holds our bones together.

00:56:07.176 --> 00:56:11.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we talk
about the uniting bond of peace,

00:56:11.597 --> 00:56:14.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
we mean that peace is the ligament.

00:56:14.391 --> 00:56:18.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the tissue
that holds God’s people together.

00:56:18.646 --> 00:56:23.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was true in the first century
and is true today.

00:56:23.567 --> 00:56:25.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the early Christians,

00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:27.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
we come from different backgrounds;

00:56:27.947 --> 00:56:29.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
we speak different languages.

00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:33.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Jehovah has shown us
how to remain united

00:56:33.702 --> 00:56:36.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at peace.

00:56:36.622 --> 00:56:40.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s explain
what we mean by being united.

00:56:40.376 --> 00:56:44.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be united doesn’t mean
that we all have to like the same things

00:56:44.505 --> 00:56:47.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we all have
to think the same on every subject.

00:56:47.508 --> 00:56:51.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s room
for a variety of tastes and opinions.

00:56:51.345 --> 00:56:54.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s variety on this convention program.

00:56:54.098 --> 00:56:56.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t all wear the same style of suit

00:56:56.642 --> 00:57:00.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
or have the same color of tie.

00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:02.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:57:02.439 --> 00:57:05.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your favorite color?

00:57:05.442 --> 00:57:08.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
your favorite food?

00:57:08.195 --> 00:57:10.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
your favorite pet?

00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jehovah’s organization,
there are dog lovers and cat lovers.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not everyone
likes the same breed of dog or cat.

00:57:18.706 --> 00:57:20.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever visited someone

00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:24.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has a pet
that he thinks is just adorable?

00:57:24.003 --> 00:57:26.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take one look at the animal,

00:57:26.005 --> 00:57:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you wonder
how anyone could love a face like that.

00:57:29.091 --> 00:57:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he does.

00:57:30.718 --> 00:57:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are different,
and their pets are grateful for that.

00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
The variety we find among God’s people today

00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:42.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue on into the new world.

00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves variety.

00:57:44.982 --> 00:57:47.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many colors are there?

00:57:47.151 --> 00:57:51.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many species of plants,
birds, and animals are there?

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:55.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among God’s creation,
we find the simple and the complex,

00:57:55.826 --> 00:58:00.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
the plain and the fancy,
the sweet and the sour,

00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:03.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rough and the smooth.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s great variety among people.

00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the new world,

00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:10.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
perfect humans won’t have
the same personality,

00:58:10.591 --> 00:58:13.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
talents, and abilities.

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve always wanted to play the violin?

00:58:15.721 --> 00:58:17.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t think that when you’re perfect,

00:58:17.723 --> 00:58:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll just be able
to pick up a violin and play.

00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:25.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s no guarantee
you’ll be able to play in our orchestra.

00:58:26.774 --> 00:58:29.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one way to maintain unity

00:58:29.193 --> 00:58:32.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to respect the conscience of others.

00:58:32.446 --> 00:58:34.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is very important

00:58:34.448 --> 00:58:37.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
because very often when unity is disturbed,

00:58:37.409 --> 00:58:39.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s because we don’t respect

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:42.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability of other brothers and sisters

00:58:42.206 --> 00:58:44.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
to decide things for themselves.

00:58:44.208 --> 00:58:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we mean by the conscience?

00:58:47.461 --> 00:58:49.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s be simple.

00:58:49.171 --> 00:58:51.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the faculty

00:58:51.173 --> 00:58:55.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps us determine right from wrong.

00:58:55.094 --> 00:58:56.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conscience is the faculty

00:58:59.223 --> 00:59:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
to determine right from wrong.

00:59:03.477 --> 00:59:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s consider
how our upbringing and our culture

00:59:07.231 --> 00:59:11.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help shape
our personal view of right and wrong.

00:59:12.903 --> 00:59:15.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cultures, there are large families.

00:59:15.989 --> 00:59:18.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Conversation around the dinner table is loud.

00:59:18.742 --> 00:59:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can hardly hear yourself think.

00:59:20.869 --> 00:59:23.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The children tease one another

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:26.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and don’t hesitate
to ask each other personal questions.

00:59:26.959 --> 00:59:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
The girls borrow each other’s clothes,

00:59:29.545 --> 00:59:32.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes without asking.

00:59:32.548 --> 00:59:34.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people would say that’s wrong,

00:59:34.675 --> 00:59:36.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the girls see nothing wrong with it,

00:59:36.677 --> 00:59:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and neither do their parents.

00:59:38.846 --> 00:59:43.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other cultures, family members
are polite and courteous,

00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:47.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they don’t talk much
about their plans or their feelings.

00:59:47.646 --> 00:59:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parents don’t often talk about their past

00:59:51.191 --> 00:59:54.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they value their privacy.

00:59:54.653 --> 00:59:56.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some who were raised that way

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
tend to be rather strict
with themselves and others.

01:00:00.325 --> 01:00:04.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have definite views of right and wrong.

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Borrow their clothes without asking

01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:08.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ll say: “That’s stealing.

01:00:08.584 --> 01:00:10.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m calling the elders.”

01:00:10.711 --> 01:00:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no gray areas with them.

01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are lots of exceptions,

01:00:16.633 --> 01:00:19.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re not saying that everyone
in a certain culture fits the bill.

01:00:19.928 --> 01:00:22.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you get the idea.

01:00:22.306 --> 01:00:24.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do you suppose happens

01:00:24.975 --> 01:00:26.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a publisher from one culture

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:31.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
moves into a congregation
where the other culture predominates?

01:00:31.398 --> 01:00:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he doesn’t adjust
his way of viewing others,

01:00:33.984 --> 01:00:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll be miserable.

01:00:35.986 --> 01:00:38.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is one way right and the other wrong?

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:39.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:00:39.656 --> 01:00:44.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Members of both cultures
could learn from one another.

01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:47.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of culture, we might ask ourselves,

01:00:47.206 --> 01:00:49.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How do I feel about brothers and sisters

01:00:49.416 --> 01:00:53.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
who come from cultures
that are very different from my own?’

01:00:53.086 --> 01:00:55.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may speak with an accent.

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their style of dress may be different.

01:00:58.634 --> 01:01:02.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their manners and food
may not be what we’re used to.

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:05.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose that an elder
is younger than we are

01:01:05.599 --> 01:01:07.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
or from a different race.

01:01:07.893 --> 01:01:10.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we accept his counsel?

01:01:10.354 --> 01:01:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we ask him for counsel?

01:01:13.482 --> 01:01:16.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or will we look for an elder who’s older

01:01:16.485 --> 01:01:19.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from a similar background?

01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:21.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we celebrate our differences,

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:26.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
or will we allow them to disturb our unity?

01:01:26.078 --> 01:01:28.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s one thing.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s talk about our personal history.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our personal history
can also affect our view of right and wrong.

01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some grew up in a household
where alcohol was a problem.

01:01:40.676 --> 01:01:43.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Home was not a happy place.

01:01:43.512 --> 01:01:48.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as adults, they stay
as far away from alcohol as they can,

01:01:48.517 --> 01:01:52.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they take a dim view
of anyone who uses it,

01:01:52.062 --> 01:01:54.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in moderation.

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:58.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it’s just plain wrong to drink.

01:01:58.986 --> 01:02:01.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others have only good memories
of their childhood home.

01:02:01.947 --> 01:02:04.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
At supper time,
there was always wine on the table,

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
but nobody ever abused it.

01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:11.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person who left behind an immoral lifestyle

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:15.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be extremely sensitive
about choices of clothing.

01:02:15.836 --> 01:02:18.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may be troubled by a clothing style

01:02:18.088 --> 01:02:22.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
that other brothers and sisters
find totally acceptable.

01:02:22.134 --> 01:02:24.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they’re not careful,

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:26.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who tend to be strict with themselves

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:28.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
could impose their conscience on others.

01:02:28.974 --> 01:02:33.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider a familiar scenario.

01:02:33.228 --> 01:02:37.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four publishers
are working rural territory in a car group.

01:02:37.357 --> 01:02:40.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, each home is separated from the next

01:02:40.235 --> 01:02:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
by many miles or kilometers.

01:02:42.738 --> 01:02:44.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the first call, the driver

01:02:44.948 --> 01:02:47.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her companion get out
and the other sisters stay in the car.

01:02:47.951 --> 01:02:50.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have no choice.
There’s no place to go.

01:02:50.704 --> 01:02:53.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the householder has many questions,

01:02:53.332 --> 01:02:56.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a Bible study has started.

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:59.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s noon when the two publishers
return to the car

01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:02.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all smiles.

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:04.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what’s coming next, don’t you?

01:03:05.719 --> 01:03:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the sisters in the back seat says,

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:12.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, the two of us
can’t count any time this morning.”

01:03:12.726 --> 01:03:14.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s she done?

01:03:14.436 --> 01:03:17.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s spoken for herself
and for her companion.

01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:22.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
And unintentionally, she’s imposed
her own conscience on her friend.

01:03:22.736 --> 01:03:25.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if she doesn’t want
to count any time, that’s her business.

01:03:25.906 --> 01:03:29.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be best
if she kept her business to herself.

01:03:30.827 --> 01:03:34.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve ever visited a foreign country
and gone on a guided tour,

01:03:34.915 --> 01:03:37.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
probably one of the things
the tour guide wanted to show you

01:03:37.918 --> 01:03:40.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the architecture inside a church.

01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:43.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some brothers
have no problem entering a church

01:03:43.507 --> 01:03:48.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it’s part of a tour because to them
it’s no different from visiting a museum.

01:03:48.095 --> 01:03:51.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others who were
strong supporters of false religion

01:03:51.682 --> 01:03:54.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
couldn’t enter a church for any reason,

01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:57.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even to attend a wedding or a funeral.

01:03:57.312 --> 01:04:01.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it’s just plain wrong.

01:04:01.817 --> 01:04:04.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consciences can differ in this respect,

01:04:04.403 --> 01:04:07.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to respect that;
we have to acknowledge that.

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:10.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to expand
on that idea in a moment.

01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:14.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve hardly scratched the surface

01:04:14.037 --> 01:04:16.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to describing
the variety of personalities

01:04:16.957 --> 01:04:20.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewpoints in Jehovah’s organization.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:22.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the question:

01:04:22.504 --> 01:04:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we maintain our unity?

01:04:26.174 --> 01:04:27.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what Paul said?

01:04:27.843 --> 01:04:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Earnestly endeavoring to maintain”

01:04:31.847 --> 01:04:36.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
—maintain this perfect bond of unity.

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:39.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that we have to put forth effort

01:04:39.813 --> 01:04:42.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain that unity.

01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:46.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
it’ll help a lot to get well-acquainted

01:04:46.027 --> 01:04:48.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
with brothers and sisters
who think differently from us.

01:04:48.864 --> 01:04:50.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get to know their background.

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:53.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll help you not to overreact

01:04:53.618 --> 01:04:56.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they take a position
that you don’t agree with.

01:04:56.538 --> 01:04:59.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll help us not to judge them.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul wrote very plainly on that subject

01:05:01.835 --> 01:05:05.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the words found at Romans 14:4

01:05:07.716 --> 01:05:10.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
—simple statement but very powerful.

01:05:10.218 --> 01:05:13.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s check it out together
at Romans chapter 14

01:05:13.597 --> 01:05:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
(I’ll give you a moment)

01:05:15.932 --> 01:05:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 4.

01:05:19.811 --> 01:05:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul writes: “Who are you

01:05:22.981 --> 01:05:26.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to judge the servant of another?

01:05:26.401 --> 01:05:29.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To his own master he stands or falls.

01:05:29.654 --> 01:05:32.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, he will be made to stand,

01:05:32.657 --> 01:05:36.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah can make him stand.”

01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:39.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s go back
and look at that first sentence again:

01:05:39.122 --> 01:05:42.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who are you to judge

01:05:42.334 --> 01:05:45.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
the servant of another?”

01:05:45.253 --> 01:05:47.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know what a judge does.

01:05:47.297 --> 01:05:50.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
He declares someone guilty or not guilty.

01:05:50.675 --> 01:05:52.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not our job.

01:05:52.677 --> 01:05:55.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Judge.

01:05:55.472 --> 01:05:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
If each of us concentrates
on his own thinking and his own conscience,

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:04.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace and unity
of the congregation will be preserved.

01:06:05.565 --> 01:06:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we all want to be balanced

01:06:08.151 --> 01:06:11.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we determine
what is right and what is wrong.

01:06:11.571 --> 01:06:15.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to have a balanced view of things
—a good conscience.

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:17.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we be balanced

01:06:17.786 --> 01:06:21.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
when determining
whether something is right or wrong?

01:06:21.623 --> 01:06:24.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in some cases, it’s easy;
the Bible tells us.

01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in other cases, there’s no clear answer.

01:06:28.171 --> 01:06:31.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a scenario
we touched on earlier

01:06:31.258 --> 01:06:33.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the matter of entering a church.

01:06:33.385 --> 01:06:36.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that may not be
a problem where you live,

01:06:36.429 --> 01:06:39.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in some places, it’s a real issue.

01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:42.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, these talks
are for our worldwide brotherhood.

01:06:42.853 --> 01:06:45.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to consider a subject

01:06:45.313 --> 01:06:49.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be a real problem
for many to overcome,

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hope that they will benefit from it.

01:06:51.194 --> 01:06:53.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the scenario:

01:06:53.196 --> 01:06:57.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two different sisters are married
to men who are not in the truth.

01:06:57.284 --> 01:07:01.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in both cases,
the husband’s mother has died.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
The funeral will be in a church.

01:07:04.499 --> 01:07:06.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister decides to go;

01:07:06.918 --> 01:07:10.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other decides against it.

01:07:10.171 --> 01:07:12.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister who decides to attend

01:07:12.632 --> 01:07:14.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
has considered that in that church,

01:07:14.843 --> 01:07:17.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will just be a talk by a clergyman.

01:07:17.512 --> 01:07:19.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no congregation singing,

01:07:19.598 --> 01:07:22.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
congregation prayers, or religious gestures.

01:07:22.851 --> 01:07:24.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was never very religious anyway,

01:07:24.978 --> 01:07:27.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
so none of that would mean anything to her.

01:07:27.188 --> 01:07:30.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And her husband and his family will be happy

01:07:30.275 --> 01:07:33.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
if she just sits quietly until it’s over.

01:07:35.363 --> 01:07:38.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second sister
has a different set of circumstances.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:43.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
The service in that church
involves participation by the congregation.

01:07:43.288 --> 01:07:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
She used to be
an active member of that church,

01:07:45.957 --> 01:07:49.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s afraid
she’ll do something she’ll regret.

01:07:49.836 --> 01:07:53.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her husband’s family
get very emotional at funerals,

01:07:53.632 --> 01:07:57.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re likely to make a scene
if she doesn’t participate.

01:07:57.177 --> 01:08:01.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she respectfully tells her husband
that her attendance

01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:05.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
could cause him embarrassment
and declines to attend.

01:08:05.977 --> 01:08:10.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see that each situation is different.

01:08:10.607 --> 01:08:15.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to discuss four questions
that we might ask ourselves

01:08:15.487 --> 01:08:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re called upon
to make any difficult decision.

01:08:19.032 --> 01:08:22.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will repeat the question

01:08:22.869 --> 01:08:24.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you’re taking notes,

01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:27.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may want to at least
write the question down.

01:08:27.499 --> 01:08:30.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are very, very good questions
that we can ask ourselves

01:08:30.961 --> 01:08:33.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we make a difficult decision.

01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:34.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

01:08:34.297 --> 01:08:36.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s number one:

01:08:36.299 --> 01:08:41.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will make Jehovah happy?

01:08:41.054 --> 01:08:43.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll repeat that.

01:08:43.056 --> 01:08:47.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will make Jehovah happy?

01:08:47.811 --> 01:08:52.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that should be our main concern,
to please Jehovah.

01:08:52.232 --> 01:08:55.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we know
what will make Jehovah happy?

01:08:55.276 --> 01:08:59.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
We identify the Bible principles
that have a bearing on the situation.

01:08:59.364 --> 01:09:01.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way we can do that

01:09:01.366 --> 01:09:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by checking the <i>Index</i>
or the <i>Research Guide.</i>

01:09:05.328 --> 01:09:07.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some Scriptural principles

01:09:07.706 --> 01:09:11.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sister who’s married to an unbeliever
might consider when deciding

01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:14.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether to attend a funeral in a church?

01:09:14.212 --> 01:09:16.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of some?

01:09:16.214 --> 01:09:19.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about 1 Peter 3:1?

01:09:19.092 --> 01:09:22.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wives, be in subjection to your husbands.”

01:09:22.512 --> 01:09:26.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is pleased when
a Christian woman respects her husband,

01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:28.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether he’s in the truth or not.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:32.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a wife’s subjection is relative.

01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:35.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s dedicated to Jehovah,

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to her husband.

01:09:38.695 --> 01:09:41.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s dedicated to Jehovah,

01:09:41.573 --> 01:09:44.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to her husband.

01:09:44.576 --> 01:09:47.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s 1 Peter 3:1.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Isaiah 52:11?

01:09:51.041 --> 01:09:53.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Touch nothing unclean! . . .

01:09:53.585 --> 01:09:56.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep yourselves clean.”

01:09:56.713 --> 01:09:58.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the Mosaic Law,

01:09:58.757 --> 01:10:01.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
if someone so much as
touched something unclean,

01:10:01.676 --> 01:10:04.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
he became unclean.

01:10:04.471 --> 01:10:08.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers and sisters
would find it very hard to sit quietly

01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:11.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
while a clergyman told lies
about the condition of the dead.

01:10:11.936 --> 01:10:16.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it would be
touching something unclean.

01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:19.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others might compare that
to a young person in school

01:10:19.944 --> 01:10:24.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
sitting quietly while his teacher
tells lies about the origin of life.

01:10:25.867 --> 01:10:29.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
If someone does decide
to attend a funeral in a church,

01:10:29.746 --> 01:10:33.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she should be absolutely determined

01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:36.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to participate in any religious ritual,

01:10:36.377 --> 01:10:39.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether singing hymns
or so much as saying “amen”

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:42.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a prayer that the clergyman offers.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the goal is to please Jehovah.

01:10:46.346 --> 01:10:48.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the first point was,

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:51.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes Jehovah happy?

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:54.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number two—number two:

01:10:54.687 --> 01:10:58.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
How might my choice affect others?

01:10:59.818 --> 01:11:01.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you got that?

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
How might my choice

01:11:04.656 --> 01:11:07.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
affect others?

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:10.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want to stumble anyone.

01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:12.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in a family matter,

01:11:12.413 --> 01:11:15.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as attending a wedding
or a funeral in a church

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:17.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which we may consider as a personal matter),

01:11:17.961 --> 01:11:20.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to weigh the effect our decision

01:11:20.672 --> 01:11:23.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have on others.

01:11:23.424 --> 01:11:26.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could affect them in one of two ways.

01:11:26.386 --> 01:11:28.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the first is the obvious way.

01:11:28.763 --> 01:11:32.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some areas, if a Witness
even entered a church,

01:11:32.642 --> 01:11:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
his brothers and sisters
would lose respect for him.

01:11:36.187 --> 01:11:39.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a second way
the Witness could stumble someone.

01:11:39.858 --> 01:11:44.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
He might be able to attend the funeral
and make no compromise.

01:11:44.028 --> 01:11:46.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suppose a new brother decided

01:11:46.364 --> 01:11:49.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
to follow his example
when a family member died.

01:11:49.367 --> 01:11:51.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new brother could give in
to family pressure

01:11:51.953 --> 01:11:54.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and participate in idolatry.

01:11:54.497 --> 01:11:57.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
How tragic is that!

01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:00.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul never worshipped idols.

01:12:00.128 --> 01:12:04.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when meat that had been offered to an idol
went up for sale in a meat market,

01:12:04.883 --> 01:12:08.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
it probably didn’t bother
Paul’s conscience to buy it

01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:10.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he knew that an idol is nothing.

01:12:10.763 --> 01:12:14.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some of his brothers had worshipped

01:12:14.017 --> 01:12:17.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
those very idols
before coming into the truth.

01:12:17.228 --> 01:12:20.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could have felt guilty
about eating that meat.

01:12:20.106 --> 01:12:24.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it would be
like having a communion meal with an idol.

01:12:26.613 --> 01:12:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
The feelings of his brothers
were important to Paul.

01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:33.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was willing to sacrifice his own rights

01:12:33.411 --> 01:12:36.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the sake of his brothers.

01:12:36.289 --> 01:12:38.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d never want to take the unloving view

01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:41.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if our brother
is stumbled by what we do,

01:12:41.336 --> 01:12:43.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s too bad for him.

01:12:43.588 --> 01:12:45.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:50.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re the type of person
who is often stumbled by what others do,

01:12:50.345 --> 01:12:54.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to ask Jehovah
to help us gain a more balanced viewpoint.

01:12:56.893 --> 01:13:00.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far, we’ve discussed
the need to make Jehovah happy

01:13:00.647 --> 01:13:03.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to consider the feelings of our brothers.

01:13:03.233 --> 01:13:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s next?

01:13:04.692 --> 01:13:09.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number three: Have I asked for counsel?

01:13:10.615 --> 01:13:12.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got that?

01:13:12.242 --> 01:13:16.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have I asked for counsel?

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe the elders haven’t dealt
with the exact situation we’re facing,

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:22.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they know a lot of people.

01:13:22.252 --> 01:13:26.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may know someone
who has dealt with the situation before

01:13:26.005 --> 01:13:28.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saw how he handled it.

01:13:28.049 --> 01:13:31.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or they may know about the effect
the decision had on others.

01:13:31.886 --> 01:13:35.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, they might know
how the congregation reacted

01:13:35.181 --> 01:13:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last time someone attended a wedding

01:13:38.601 --> 01:13:40.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a funeral in a church.

01:13:42.605 --> 01:13:46.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another situation where brothers often ask
for the help of the elders

01:13:46.526 --> 01:13:50.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves the use of blood fractions.

01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:53.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we accept them or not?

01:13:53.324 --> 01:13:58.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has refused
to impose its conscience on the brotherhood.

01:13:58.162 --> 01:13:59.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do we know?

01:13:59.414 --> 01:14:04.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that the Bible says
to “abstain . . . from blood.”

01:14:04.085 --> 01:14:07.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as you divide it into fractions

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:10.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fractions get tinier and tinier,

01:14:10.383 --> 01:14:15.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
at what point does blood stop being blood?

01:14:15.138 --> 01:14:18.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one will have to decide that
for himself.

01:14:18.433 --> 01:14:19.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some might say,

01:14:19.851 --> 01:14:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, if it’s a really,
really tiny fraction,

01:14:22.186 --> 01:14:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t bother me to take it.”

01:14:24.063 --> 01:14:26.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
But others will say:
“It doesn’t matter to me.

01:14:26.274 --> 01:14:29.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s from blood, I don’t want it.”

01:14:29.819 --> 01:14:34.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their conscience
also has to be respected.

01:14:34.115 --> 01:14:36.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s illustrate:

01:14:36.242 --> 01:14:39.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Air is made up of nitrogen

01:14:39.912 --> 01:14:41.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and oxygen,

01:14:41.914 --> 01:14:46.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and together they make up 99 percent of air.

01:14:46.919 --> 01:14:49.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
That leaves 1 percent.

01:14:49.547 --> 01:14:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 1 percent is made up
of a variety of gases:

01:14:53.092 --> 01:14:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
carbon dioxide, hydrogen, neon

01:14:56.929 --> 01:15:00.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
—small fractions.

01:15:00.183 --> 01:15:02.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to small fractions,

01:15:02.226 --> 01:15:04.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders need to be careful, though,

01:15:04.228 --> 01:15:07.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to insert their personal opinion
into the discussion,

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as by saying
“I wouldn’t take any of it.”

01:15:11.194 --> 01:15:15.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should simply help the publisher
to reason on the basic principles

01:15:15.365 --> 01:15:18.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let him make up his own mind.

01:15:18.409 --> 01:15:20.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
So where are we?

01:15:20.495 --> 01:15:22.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
We make Jehovah happy.

01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:25.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
We consider the feelings
of our brothers and sisters.

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:27.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
We ask for counsel.

01:15:27.293 --> 01:15:29.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number four:

01:15:29.295 --> 01:15:32.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I take the time

01:15:33.591 --> 01:15:36.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
—did I take the time—

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:40.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meditate prayerfully
before making my decision?

01:15:42.058 --> 01:15:46.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I take the time to meditate prayerfully

01:15:46.062 --> 01:15:48.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
before making my decision?

01:15:48.856 --> 01:15:52.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your goal is to make Jehovah happy.

01:15:52.068 --> 01:15:54.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you wouldn’t want
to make your decision hastily

01:15:54.529 --> 01:15:56.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then ask Jehovah to bless it.

01:15:56.614 --> 01:15:59.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should ask Jehovah for guidance first

01:15:59.659 --> 01:16:02.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than asking him to bless a decision

01:16:02.412 --> 01:16:04.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve already made.

01:16:04.997 --> 01:16:07.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard someone say,

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That doesn’t bother my conscience”?

01:16:09.877 --> 01:16:14.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might ask:
‘How did he come to that conclusion?

01:16:14.424 --> 01:16:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he follow the four steps
we just mentioned?

01:16:18.094 --> 01:16:22.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he do research to learn
what makes Jehovah happy?

01:16:22.014 --> 01:16:24.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he think
about how others might be affected?

01:16:24.851 --> 01:16:26.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he ask for counsel?

01:16:26.853 --> 01:16:30.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And did he meditate prayerfully
on his decision?

01:16:30.398 --> 01:16:35.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is he just following his feelings?’

01:16:35.069 --> 01:16:38.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following your feelings isn’t the same

01:16:38.406 --> 01:16:42.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
as following a Bible-trained conscience.

01:16:42.034 --> 01:16:43.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

01:16:43.453 --> 01:16:47.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following your feelings is not the same

01:16:47.206 --> 01:16:51.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
as following a Bible-trained conscience.

01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:54.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our conscience needs to be trained

01:16:54.172 --> 01:16:56.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with Scriptural principles.

01:16:56.716 --> 01:16:59.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul’s conscience
didn’t bother him a bit

01:16:59.719 --> 01:17:01.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was persecuting Christians.

01:17:01.721 --> 01:17:04.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
He thought he was doing Jehovah a favor.

01:17:04.265 --> 01:17:07.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when he realized
how Jehovah felt about it,

01:17:07.185 --> 01:17:09.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knew he had to change.

01:17:09.479 --> 01:17:14.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to be sure that we’re really getting
Jehovah’s thinking on matters.

01:17:14.358 --> 01:17:17.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jeremiah 17:9

01:17:20.156 --> 01:17:23.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
—simple expression but so true.

01:17:23.784 --> 01:17:28.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 17

01:17:28.164 --> 01:17:30.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 9 says:

01:17:32.793 --> 01:17:36.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The heart is more treacherous

01:17:36.172 --> 01:17:39.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“than anything else and is desperate.

01:17:39.509 --> 01:17:41.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who can know it?”

01:17:43.513 --> 01:17:47.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The heart is treacherous.’

01:17:47.433 --> 01:17:50.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might allow our emotions
to get the better of us.

01:17:50.645 --> 01:17:54.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when a family member
is disfellowshipped,

01:17:54.148 --> 01:17:56.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the person is living outside the home,

01:17:56.359 --> 01:17:58.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that we should limit our association

01:17:58.444 --> 01:18:01.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
to necessary family business.

01:18:01.447 --> 01:18:05.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if the family was never very close,
that might not be a problem.

01:18:05.535 --> 01:18:09.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suppose family ties are really strong;

01:18:09.455 --> 01:18:11.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can be a challenge.

01:18:11.749 --> 01:18:14.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we allow ourselves to be ruled by emotion

01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:17.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than by Scriptural principles,

01:18:17.505 --> 01:18:21.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could stretch the meaning
of necessary family business

01:18:21.592 --> 01:18:24.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
to include almost any activity.

01:18:24.845 --> 01:18:27.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
The heart is treacherous.

01:18:28.975 --> 01:18:32.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asking ourselves
the four questions we just mentioned

01:18:32.186 --> 01:18:36.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to make decisions
based on godly principles

01:18:36.023 --> 01:18:40.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than simply relying on our feelings.

01:18:40.361 --> 01:18:43.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s see how mature Christians

01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:47.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
can apply these principles
and how the elders can help.

01:18:48.536 --> 01:18:50.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video interviews

01:18:50.663 --> 01:18:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
are about weddings and funerals

01:18:53.749 --> 01:18:57.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a touchy subject
in many cultures, as you will see.

01:19:02.592 --> 01:19:04.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Japan,

01:19:04.594 --> 01:19:08.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
religious rituals are associated
with each stage of life

01:19:08.222 --> 01:19:10.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with each season of the year.

01:19:11.767 --> 01:19:13.769 line:10% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:19:13.769 --> 01:19:16.522 line:10% position:50% align:center
we want to keep the cleanliness and unity

01:19:16.522 --> 01:19:19.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the congregation.

01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:22.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard,
one of the most delicate areas

01:19:22.612 --> 01:19:27.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the decision on whether to attend
a non-Witness funeral or not.

01:19:29.577 --> 01:19:33.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first thing we must consider
regarding funerals is not to be involved

01:19:33.789 --> 01:19:38.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
in religious rituals and acts of worship
that are condemned by the Bible.

01:19:39.837 --> 01:19:41.464 line:10% position:50% align:center
In harmony with the principle

01:19:41.464 --> 01:19:44.842 line:10% position:50% align:center
at 2 Corinthians 6:14,

01:19:44.842 --> 01:19:47.011 line:10% position:50% align:center
we need to keep completely separate

01:19:47.011 --> 01:19:48.512 line:10% position:50% align:center
from pagan acts of worship.

01:19:50.723 --> 01:19:55.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, even if we don’t participate
in the worship of other religions,

01:19:55.603 --> 01:20:00.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to consider if our decisions
could stumble someone in the congregation.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.570 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we consider the Bible principle

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:07.281 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Luke 17:2,

01:20:07.281 --> 01:20:09.617 line:10% position:50% align:center
we do not want our decisions to hinder

01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:11.827 line:10% position:50% align:center
the faith of someone in the congregation.

01:20:16.499 --> 01:20:20.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third point to think about
is our conscience.

01:20:21.337 --> 01:20:23.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to seriously think

01:20:23.339 --> 01:20:24.757 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the Bible principle

01:20:24.757 --> 01:20:28.260 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 6:5, where it says

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.138 line:10% position:50% align:center
that each must “carry his own load.”

01:20:33.391 --> 01:20:36.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible principle also applies
when elders want to support others.

01:20:38.104 --> 01:20:42.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, those in the congregation
can ask the elders for support

01:20:42.733 --> 01:20:45.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
in issues related to funerals.

01:20:46.362 --> 01:20:48.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in matters of conscience,

01:20:48.614 --> 01:20:51.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders cannot force decisions on others.

01:20:53.536 --> 01:20:57.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it would be wrong to make
some kind of rule regarding attending

01:20:57.415 --> 01:20:59.083 line:10% position:50% align:center
non-Witness funerals.

01:21:00.668 --> 01:21:02.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
If each person can make

01:21:02.044 --> 01:21:04.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
decisions based on Bible principles,

01:21:04.588 --> 01:21:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can have a truly peaceful

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:08.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and free atmosphere

01:21:08.592 --> 01:21:10.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
where each individual’s

01:21:10.469 --> 01:21:13.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
differing situation is respected.

01:21:14.473 --> 01:21:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
This would really contribute
to the unity of the congregation.

01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all can maintain a clean conscience

01:21:21.188 --> 01:21:23.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve happily before Jehovah.

01:21:26.652 --> 01:21:28.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my culture,

01:21:28.529 --> 01:21:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifically the Namibian Oshiwambo
culture,

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
like in many African cultures,

01:21:33.743 --> 01:21:38.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many spiritistic customs
related to weddings

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are included in wedding celebrations.

01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:43.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth.

01:21:43.127 --> 01:21:44.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, for Ben and I,

01:21:44.628 --> 01:21:47.506 line:10% position:50% align:center
that was one of the main concerns.

01:21:47.506 --> 01:21:50.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
They don’t understand our worship of Jehovah,

01:21:50.092 --> 01:21:52.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they don’t understand
that we apply Bible principles

01:21:52.636 --> 01:21:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the traditions of men.

01:21:54.764 --> 01:21:57.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got engaged before the pandemic,

01:21:57.475 --> 01:22:00.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
but obviously, now that our wedding
was to be over videoconferencing,

01:22:00.853 --> 01:22:04.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
it meant that we didn’t have control
over many things.

01:22:04.023 --> 01:22:06.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to imagine situations

01:22:06.317 --> 01:22:08.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could stumble our brothers or disrupt

01:22:08.319 --> 01:22:10.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unity in the congregation.

01:22:12.907 --> 01:22:15.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to, in advance,

01:22:15.034 --> 01:22:17.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
think of Bible principles
that would apply in our case,

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:22.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
but particularly what we also found helpful
was speaking to a mature elder.

01:22:22.541 --> 01:22:26.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave us a principle at Proverbs 14:15.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told us to be very careful
when people say,

01:22:30.883 --> 01:22:34.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will do this” or “I won’t do this”
at your wedding.

01:22:34.053 --> 01:22:38.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, it was up to us to make sure
that the proceedings

01:22:38.808 --> 01:22:40.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
or things that happen at our wedding

01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:44.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be in order and in harmony
with Bible principles.

01:22:44.605 --> 01:22:46.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another principle that came to mind was

01:22:46.774 --> 01:22:50.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Corinthians 10:23.

01:22:50.194 --> 01:22:54.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, we knew
that we had the right to do many things,

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were also very conscious

01:22:56.283 --> 01:22:59.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how our brothers would view our wedding.

01:22:59.745 --> 01:23:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want anybody to be at our wedding
and feel embarrassed

01:23:03.833 --> 01:23:06.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even stumbled to be there.

01:23:07.169 --> 01:23:09.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now looking back at our wedding,

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
we look back with fond memories.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:18.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
So applying Bible principles
didn’t restrict our fun.

01:23:19.682 --> 01:23:22.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, it contributed to the unity
among our brothers

01:23:22.309 --> 01:23:25.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all of us
—those present, those who were invited—

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to enjoy the wedding.

01:23:27.147 --> 01:23:30.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not worried about thinking,
‘Oh, did that thing offend anybody?’

01:23:30.359 --> 01:23:34.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re able to enjoy the day
without any bad memories.

01:23:40.452 --> 01:23:43.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see,
our brothers in many countries

01:23:43.956 --> 01:23:46.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
are faced with very difficult decisions

01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:48.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
where weddings and funerals are concerned.

01:23:48.919 --> 01:23:53.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The guidance the elders
can provide is invaluable.

01:23:53.924 --> 01:23:56.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes medical doctors

01:23:56.343 --> 01:23:59.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
complain that their Witness patients
are inconsistent

01:23:59.388 --> 01:24:03.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they don’t all have the same view
of certain medical treatments.

01:24:03.392 --> 01:24:06.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Witness patient
accepts certain fractions or therapies,

01:24:06.854 --> 01:24:10.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the doctor figures he knows
what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe.

01:24:10.774 --> 01:24:13.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the next patient comes along,

01:24:13.485 --> 01:24:15.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he rejects them all.

01:24:15.571 --> 01:24:18.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctor is confused.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those doctors don’t understand
the role of the conscience.

01:24:21.785 --> 01:24:24.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
We shouldn’t worry
when medical professionals

01:24:24.413 --> 01:24:26.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t understand our differing viewpoints,

01:24:26.415 --> 01:24:29.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we should be glad
that we serve a God

01:24:29.168 --> 01:24:32.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
who dignifies us
with the freedom to make many

01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:34.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our own decisions.

01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:38.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the apostle Paul
mentioned four qualities

01:24:38.552 --> 01:24:42.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to maintain
the uniting bond of peace.

01:24:42.097 --> 01:24:44.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to find those qualities

01:24:44.099 --> 01:24:46.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ephesians chapter 4,

01:24:46.143 --> 01:24:49.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to zero in on verse 2.

01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:53.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to Ephesians chapter 4,

01:24:53.442 --> 01:24:55.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to look at verse 2.

01:24:55.527 --> 01:24:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we read verses 3-6 earlier,

01:24:58.572 --> 01:25:01.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you know that Paul
was concerned about unity.

01:25:01.283 --> 01:25:03.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unity is what he had on his mind,

01:25:03.494 --> 01:25:06.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now he is telling us
that these four qualities

01:25:06.997 --> 01:25:10.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
are going to help us to maintain our unity.

01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:12.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Earnestly endeavoring”

01:25:12.711 --> 01:25:15.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
—remember when he said
“earnestly endeavoring

01:25:15.339 --> 01:25:18.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain the oneness of the spirit”?

01:25:18.258 --> 01:25:22.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the work that we need
to put into promoting unity.

01:25:22.554 --> 01:25:24.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 2 says:

01:25:24.556 --> 01:25:29.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With all humility and mildness,

01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:32.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with patience,

01:25:32.398 --> 01:25:36.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting up with one another in love.”

01:25:36.735 --> 01:25:38.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

01:25:38.112 --> 01:25:42.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice the qualities:
humility, mildness,

01:25:42.741 --> 01:25:45.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
patience, and love?

01:25:45.703 --> 01:25:47.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re humble,

01:25:47.705 --> 01:25:51.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
we recognize that our opinion
isn’t always the right one.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:54.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility will also prevent us

01:25:54.044 --> 01:25:56.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
from trying to impose
our conscience on others

01:25:56.588 --> 01:26:01.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if Jehovah had appointed us to judge them.

01:26:01.176 --> 01:26:03.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about mildness?

01:26:03.679 --> 01:26:07.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mildness will help us to think
about the effect our words might have

01:26:07.224 --> 01:26:09.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our brothers and sisters.

01:26:09.268 --> 01:26:11.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want to hurt them,

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:14.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when we strongly disagree with them.

01:26:14.606 --> 01:26:17.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we should give them
the benefit of the doubt.

01:26:17.818 --> 01:26:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
If someone says something
that makes you mad,

01:26:21.155 --> 01:26:24.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
pray before you speak.

01:26:25.492 --> 01:26:29.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray before you speak.

01:26:31.498 --> 01:26:35.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love covers a multitude of sins,”

01:26:35.335 --> 01:26:38.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
which contributes
to the peace of the congregation.

01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:42.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we deeply appreciate it
when our brothers are patient with us.

01:26:42.342 --> 01:26:45.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, we need to be patient with them

01:26:45.679 --> 01:26:50.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re all
at different stages of spiritual growth,

01:26:50.309 --> 01:26:52.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to acknowledge that.

01:26:53.979 --> 01:26:56.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve talked
about making Jehovah happy

01:26:56.815 --> 01:26:58.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our decisions.

01:26:58.817 --> 01:27:01.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also please Jehovah
when we work hard

01:27:01.236 --> 01:27:03.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote peace in the congregation,

01:27:03.906 --> 01:27:06.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes it does take
an earnest endeavor.

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:09.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we have to work hard

01:27:09.244 --> 01:27:12.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
at ensuring
that the congregation is at peace.

01:27:12.623 --> 01:27:14.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the elders?

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:19.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders take the lead
in working together in unity.

01:27:19.046 --> 01:27:22.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should always speak with a united voice.

01:27:22.591 --> 01:27:26.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they don’t, their congregation
will sense that they’re divided,

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this will make
the brothers and sisters uneasy.

01:27:29.807 --> 01:27:33.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any difference of opinion
should be worked out in private,

01:27:33.644 --> 01:27:37.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
while showing deep respect for one another.

01:27:37.648 --> 01:27:42.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because someone disagrees with us
doesn’t make him a bad person.

01:27:42.027 --> 01:27:44.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to understand that,

01:27:44.029 --> 01:27:48.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his difference of opinion
may search us through.

01:27:48.659 --> 01:27:51.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be something
that we need to think about and consider.

01:27:51.537 --> 01:27:56.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we always consider
that the other person may be right.

01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:58.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about us publishers?

01:27:58.043 --> 01:28:01.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re having a hard time
getting along with someone,

01:28:01.004 --> 01:28:03.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than asking Jehovah to change him,

01:28:03.715 --> 01:28:06.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should ask Jehovah to mold us,

01:28:06.218 --> 01:28:08.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the Great Potter he is.

01:28:08.512 --> 01:28:12.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should ask him to show us
why he drew that person to the congregation.

01:28:12.808 --> 01:28:14.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what Jesus said?

01:28:14.601 --> 01:28:18.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘No one comes to him
unless the Father draws him.’

01:28:18.647 --> 01:28:21.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah see in that person

01:28:21.483 --> 01:28:23.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we aren’t seeing?

01:28:25.028 --> 01:28:28.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We each have a responsibility to contribute

01:28:28.407 --> 01:28:31.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the peace and unity of the congregation.

01:28:31.535 --> 01:28:35.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless us
as we work toward that goal.

01:28:37.666 --> 01:28:41.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane,
for that motivating talk!

01:28:41.503 --> 01:28:44.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are determined to do our part

01:28:44.214 --> 01:28:48.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
to safeguard our “uniting bond of peace.”

01:28:50.721 --> 01:28:55.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
This session has provided
such practical lessons!

01:28:55.475 --> 01:28:59.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we look forward to
in the next session?

01:28:59.021 --> 01:29:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme scripture will be Romans 15:13,

01:29:03.859 --> 01:29:05.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says in part:

01:29:05.861 --> 01:29:08.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

01:29:08.238 --> 01:29:12.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill you with all joy and peace.”

01:29:12.618 --> 01:29:15.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
The program will feature
a seven-part symposium

01:29:15.621 --> 01:29:18.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Bible examples of those who sowed

and reaped peace.

01:29:21.168 --> 01:29:24.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will also want to invite
as many as possible

01:29:24.129 --> 01:29:27.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy the public Bible discourse entitled

01:29:27.799 --> 01:29:31.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Friendship With God—How Possible?”

01:29:33.513 --> 01:29:37.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s sing together song number 113,

01:29:37.851 --> 01:29:42.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
which draws attention to what it means
to have godly peace.

01:29:42.147 --> 01:29:44.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
The song is entitled

01:29:44.191 --> 01:29:47.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our Possession of Peace.”

01:29:47.694 --> 01:29:52.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the song, you may have
your local concluding prayer.

Again, that’s song number 113.

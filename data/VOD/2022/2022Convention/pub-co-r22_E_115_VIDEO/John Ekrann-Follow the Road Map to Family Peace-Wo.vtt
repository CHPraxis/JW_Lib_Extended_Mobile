WEBVTT

00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:04.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants your family
to be happy and peaceful.

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:07.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah does more than simply say,

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I hope you have a peaceful family life.”

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:13.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explains exactly how we
can get our family there.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to imagine Jehovah
laying out a map in front of you

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saying: “See these landmarks?

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look for them on the road to peace.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you see them,
you’re going in the right direction.”

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far in this symposium, we’ve passed

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
the landmarks of showing love and respect,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
improving communication,

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and working together as a team.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last landmark
we’ll consider in this symposium

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
is worshipping together as a family.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Worshipping together as a family

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
promotes peace and brings his blessing.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if not all in your family
are worshippers of Jehovah,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can promote peace
by maintaining a very good spiritual routine.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:59.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,
notice some common obstacles

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, babe.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s for family worship this week?

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I got some good ideas.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for reading that.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just go ahead and ask the question.
We’ll just do that.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
So paragraphs 13 and 14:
“How can we be generous?”

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anybody?

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:45.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the footnote that we just read
really helps us to appreciate

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
the definition of that quality.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the definition, we’re left to wonder

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
exactly what it is
and how it connects to the other things

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve discussed this evening.

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe, can you go ahead
and read the next one for us?

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:02.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains many examples
of submissive individuals.

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:13.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are there examples?

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sue.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:19.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:23.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we talk about examples,
where do we start?

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are examples in the past;

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are even examples presently.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we could even be examples.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s—that’s the power of them.

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep going.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a lot of reading.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to enjoy family worship, but

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like the things that we are covering

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
are just really not what I need right now.

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:05.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:10.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, I just don’t know
if this is what they need right now.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:11.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll keep working on it.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we’d all agree that family worship
was difficult to watch.

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was uncomfortable for everyone.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Max and Irene had some obstacles

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
they needed to overcome
to really worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
To start and keep a good habit going

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:41.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires determination and resolve.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s where you need
to start for your family.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need to resolve

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’re going
to worship Jehovah as a family.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:51.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the resolve in Joshua’s words

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Joshua 24:15.

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Joshua 24:15:

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:04.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah,

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“choose for yourselves today
whom you will serve,

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether the gods that your forefathers
served on the other side of the River

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:16.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or the gods of the Amorites
in whose land you are dwelling.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But as for me and my household,

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will serve Jehovah.”

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:26.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, worship of Jehovah as a family

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:30.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs to be at the very center
of your family life.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, weekly family worship

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:35.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not all that’s involved
in worshipping together as a family.

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:37.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider five ways

00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:41.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can worship Jehovah together as a family.

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:43.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Prayer.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:47.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, do not underestimate the impact

00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:50.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your prayers have on your children.

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:54.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a child hears their parents
pour out their hearts to Jehovah,

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
that tells them that Jehovah
is very real to their parents.

00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:02.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can recall growing up listening
to my father’s prayers.

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when I was young,
I thought his prayers were very long.

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:11.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as I grew older and really
listened carefully to what he was saying,

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:15.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could see how much of a close relationship
he had with Jehovah.

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Discuss the daily text.

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an excellent habit

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:25.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a very spiritual way to start the day.

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:28.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Attend meetings.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:32.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re not just making sure our family
is there at the meetings

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that they’re involved and engaged.

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
And work hard to prepare
so that all family members

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:39.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have a meaningful comment
at the meetings.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) Share in the ministry regularly
as a family.

00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:48.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sharing in the ministry together
as a family

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:50.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us closer to our family members.

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we hear them speak about the truth,

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
we listen to their phone calls,

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:58.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we read their letters,

00:05:58.212 --> 00:06:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can feel their faith.

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved going in the ministry with my mother

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:06.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listening to her skillfully use the Bible

00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:08.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
to answer questions.

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:12.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
And (5) have a consistent,

00:06:12.392 --> 00:06:16.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyable,
and meaningful Family Worship program.

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:20.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what that means
—first of all, consistent.

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:23.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, Max was trying to have

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:25.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
the family worship consistently each week.

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:28.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your family worship consistent each week?

00:06:30.202 --> 00:06:32.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your family worship enjoyable?

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:35.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, the kids were bored.

00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:39.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were looking at their phones
and checking the time.

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:42.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
And week after week
of kind of a question-and-answer style

00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:46.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
led to the young people
giving sort of one-word answers.

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:48.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
It did not look enjoyable.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:53.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, would your family
describe family worship as enjoyable?

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:57.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about meaningful?

00:06:57.104 --> 00:06:59.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Max was using for material

00:06:59.106 --> 00:07:02.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
was material that he thought was meaningful.

00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:06.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did it look like it 
was meaningful to the family?

00:07:06.947 --> 00:07:11.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does your family worship use material
that is meaningful to your family?

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:15.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, after reviewing these five points,

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:17.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t want you to be discouraged

00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:21.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it’s a struggle
to maintain a good routine.

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:23.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life in this system has many challenges,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
trials, and unexpected events.

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:28.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stay positive.

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:31.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when your good routine
breaks down from time to time,

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:33.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider what adjustments you can make

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be successful and get
your spiritual routine back on track.

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:42.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regularly ask Jehovah for his help,
and don’t give up.

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:46.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you watch
the following dramatization,

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:49.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Max and Irene
and the family worked together

00:07:49.698 --> 00:07:52.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make family worship successful.

00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:00.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
March 15, 2014, <i>Watchtower, </i>

00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:05.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Family Worship
—Can you Make It More Enjoyable?”:

00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:10.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The worship of Jehovah
should not be boring. . . .

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:14.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Address the needs of each family member.”

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babe, what do our kids need?

00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:24.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s actually going on in their lives?

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family worship needs to include that.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe we need to pay more attention
to what’s going on with them.

00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:36.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to them; listen to them.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to send you a link
to a great <i>Watchtower</i>  article.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:43.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to read it.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Max and I changed our approach.

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:55.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
We found out what mattered to our kids

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like friends,

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:03.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . adjusting to a blended family,

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . dating.

00:09:14.324 --> 00:09:16.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we turned things around
and used family worship

00:09:16.535 --> 00:09:19.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on what our kids really needed

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:36.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prepare ourselves
for possible future trials.

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:52.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night, y’all.

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:53.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:55.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:56.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um,

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:01.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
family worship was—was cool.

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:03.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:05.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad you liked it.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night, y’all.

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:08.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Night.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey! Guess what?

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:13.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:17.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
I applied to Bethel.

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:18.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did?

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:21.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s really exciting.

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:24.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m proud of you.

00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:25.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:29.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, congratulations.

00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:31.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:36.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, it’s selfie time, everybody.
Come on, let’s get together.

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:39.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. On three
we’re going to say Bethel, OK?

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:43.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
One, two, three.

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:45.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethel!

00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:07.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve come a long way.

00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:20.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
And through it all,

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has taught us to love

00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:26.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given our family

00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:27.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace.

00:12:41.031 --> 00:12:45.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see that Max and Irene analyzed
what was wrong with family worship

00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:48.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided to change their approach.

00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:52.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s examine how they did that
and what it means for us.

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:55.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did they do to make their

00:12:55.128 --> 00:12:57.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
family worship more meaningful?

00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Max and Irene had to ask themselves

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:03.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was going on in their kids’ lives.

00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:06.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
What topics could they
discuss at family worship

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would truly be useful to their kids?

00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:13.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you smile when you saw Max
almost drop the glass

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:16.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
when his daughter talked about dating?

00:13:16.024 --> 00:13:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a difference their efforts to listen

00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:21.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really understand what was happening

00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:24.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the kids made in the family worship!

00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:29.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Max and Irene
make family worship more enjoyable?

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:33.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how the family
was reacting at family worship now?

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a difference!

00:13:35.627 --> 00:13:37.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
The kids were smiling.

00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:39.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
They looked engaged in the discussion

00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:43.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and touched by what they were discussing.

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:46.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do what you can
to make sure that your family

00:13:46.388 --> 00:13:48.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
feels relaxed and happy

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:51.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that your family worship reflects

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:54.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
the kind of happy
and joyful God that Jehovah is.

00:13:54.187 --> 00:13:57.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, your family will often remember

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
more about how they felt
during family worship

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
than maybe the exact details
of what they learned.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make your family worship consistent,

00:14:10.286 --> 00:14:12.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyable, and meaningful.

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:16.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
And work together to overcome obstacles,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Max and Irene and the kids
all worked together to solve problems

00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and create a very peaceful family life.

00:14:24.968 --> 00:14:27.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was really beautiful to see how far

00:14:27.512 --> 00:14:30.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had come by applying Bible principles.

00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:34.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
In review, this symposium has taught us

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:36.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Bible principles can be used

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:40.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a road map to family peace.

00:14:40.024 --> 00:14:42.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work hard to show love and respect,

00:14:42.944 --> 00:14:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
to improve communication,
to work together as a team,

00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:50.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to worship Jehovah together.

00:14:50.118 --> 00:14:53.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please be patient with one another

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:57.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you form habits that lead to peace.

00:14:57.083 --> 00:14:59.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s help, you and your family

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:03.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
will enjoy peace that only he can provide.

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:26.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are overjoyed that you are
among the millions around the world

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are viewing this convention.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
An infirm Bible student named Joyce,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
who lives in Southeast Asia,

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed her appreciation
for these arrangements by saying:

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With the convention being streamed online,

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t have to miss a single talk!

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:51.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can watch the program
with the rest of the brotherhood worldwide.

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:55.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am so thankful to Jehovah
for this arrangement.”

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can relate to her expressions.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for the generous donations
you have made online

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:10.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
at donate.jw.org and by other means,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
which help make
these streaming services possible.

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:18.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
During these critical last days,

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:20.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
many families lack the affection

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:25.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah designed us to give and receive.

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:28.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, God’s Word contains principles

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:31.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
that, when followed, lead to peace.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:37.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re sure you will enjoy
the fine talks and dramatizations

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this next symposium.

00:01:40.914 --> 00:01:44.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
will deliver the first talk,

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace
—Show Love and Respect.”

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:03.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family peace is precious.

00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:05.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s even as the Bible proverb says:

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Better is a piece of dry bread
where there is peace

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:13.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
than a house full of feasting
along with quarreling.”

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:16.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what exactly is family peace?

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:21.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone might say, “As long as we’re not
arguing, our family is at peace.”

00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:24.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is that real peace?

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might think of two countries
that were fighting

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have now agreed to a cease-fire.

00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the cease-fire mean that they’ve become

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
real friends who love one another?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:40.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that genuine peace takes more work.

00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:43.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true in the family as well.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our heavenly Father knows
that the most satisfying family peace

00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:51.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves more than an absence of arguing.

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:55.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves a family’s well-being and unity.

00:02:56.406 --> 00:03:00.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is such peace in a family today
really possible?

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although none of us have a perfect family,
the answer is yes.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:09.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it requires work
—perhaps breaking bad habits

00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:13.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
that disrupt peace and adopting
new ones that promote it—

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:15.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
those efforts are worth it.

00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:18.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium,

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:23.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how Bible principles
can guide families to peace,

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:25.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as a road map

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
guides travelers to a beautiful destination.

00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:33.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each of the talks,
we invite you husbands, fathers,

00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:37.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
wives, mothers, children, teenagers

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:40.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be the traveler who studies the map

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then goes in the right direction.

00:03:43.287 --> 00:03:45.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
The focus of our first talk

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:49.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
is showing love and respect.

00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:52.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would you say these two qualities

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:55.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
are so important to family peace?

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:57.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s simple:

00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:00.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
because family members
who love and respect one another

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel secure and appreciated.

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:06.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, our relationships

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
are warm, close, and peaceful.

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, showing love and respect
can be a challenge these days.

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:17.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization notice why.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irene.

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:25.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww,

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:27.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
you look so handsome there.

00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:30.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you look beautiful.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those came out so nice.

00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:35.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at you.

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:37.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Crazy, right?

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the day!

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:40.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at us.

00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:41.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so surprised.

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:43.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just knew you were going to do it.

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:44.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, Olivia.

00:04:44.807 --> 00:04:45.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s OK, Sue.

00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:48.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:49.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:50.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, I’m all moved in.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:52.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the last box.

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:55.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, are those the wedding photos?

00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:56.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:57.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look it. Here’s . . .

00:04:58.947 --> 00:05:01.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you all look beautiful.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:01.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
That dress looks so nice.

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:02.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
You look so good.

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, look at you.

00:05:04.327 --> 00:05:06.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, that suits you.

00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:08.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice, you guys.

00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:09.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it all came together.

00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really did.

00:05:11.084 --> 00:05:11.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:25.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia?

00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:29.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know this is all new, baby.

00:05:29.978 --> 00:05:31.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient.

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:41.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I cut in?

00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:43.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong?

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:10.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the desk?

00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:12.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to get rid of it.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:14.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one is better for everyone.

00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:16.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mean it’s better for him!

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Max?

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you care?

00:06:21.488 --> 00:06:24.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t talk to me like that. Get back here!

00:06:54.563 --> 00:06:57.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Olivia, what do you think
about the desk?

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:00.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come here, sweetie. Come here.

00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:12.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you never forget that I love you.

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you like it.

00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:25.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, every family
faces challenges of some sort.

00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:27.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consult our road map together

00:07:27.638 --> 00:07:30.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible at Romans 12:10.

00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:32.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you read it with me, please?

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:36.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Romans 12:10:

00:07:36.314 --> 00:07:38.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In brotherly love

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:42.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have tender affection for one another.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:46.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:48.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regardless of the role we play in the family,

00:07:51.913 --> 00:07:56.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
each of us needs to treat our family members
with love and respect.

00:07:56.668 --> 00:08:00.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to “take the lead,”
or initiative, to do so.

00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us, let’s consider four good habits

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:07.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of us should work
to develop more fully.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habit number one:

00:08:09.764 --> 00:08:13.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regularly express tender affection.

00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:15.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
When conveyed with sincerity,

00:08:15.854 --> 00:08:17.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressions of affection

00:08:17.856 --> 00:08:21.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
are like sunshine and water to plants.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:24.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
They help everyone
in the family grow and thrive.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video we just watched,
did you note how Olivia

00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:33.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
cherished her father’s gift (that green desk)
and his tender words?

00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:38.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told her,
“So you never forget that I love you.”

00:08:38.376 --> 00:08:40.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also saw warm affection

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:45.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the newly blended family
of Max and Irene looked at wedding photos.

00:08:45.175 --> 00:08:47.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was encouraging.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s a question: How are we doing

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
in expressing tender affection in our family?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that’s not one of our strengths,

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:59.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might relate to a husband
who mustered up the courage

00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:02.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say “I love you” to his wife.

00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:05.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brought her to tears—tears of joy.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said this, “I love you too,

00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:13.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this is the first time in 25 years
you’ve said it like that.”

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to wait that long, of course,

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:23.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
but even an awkward attempt
at expressing affection in our family

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an act of love,
and it can do so much good.

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a habit we all want to cultivate.

00:09:30.846 --> 00:09:33.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a second habit:

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be kind in your actions,

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:39.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
tone of voice, and choice of words.

00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:43.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, we recall Irene’s reassurance
to her daughter, Olivia.

00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “I know this is all new, baby.

00:09:46.403 --> 00:09:48.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient.”

00:09:48.071 --> 00:09:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom was kind

00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:53.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what she said and how she said it.

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:56.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little later, though, Olivia was upset.

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:58.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we know she was hurt,

00:09:58.332 --> 00:10:02.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
her speech and actions were not so kind,
were they?

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:04.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,

00:10:04.296 --> 00:10:07.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us have been under tremendous stress,

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:10.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely we didn’t always treat others

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:13.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our family as kindly
as we would have liked.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s in the past.

00:10:15.057 --> 00:10:17.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can we all do now?

00:10:17.893 --> 00:10:21.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can pray to Jehovah
to help us “take the lead”

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:23.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
in showing kindness.

00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:27.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
every day greeting one another kindly,

00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:30.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day saying “please” and “thank you,”

00:10:30.114 --> 00:10:34.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
sharing little gifts,
making time to talk, really listening

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:37.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of these are acts of kindness.

00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:40.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good habit we all want to cultivate.

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:44.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s habit number three?

00:10:44.003 --> 00:10:48.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be quick to apologize and forgive freely.

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:52.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, Olivia’s new stepsister, Sue,

00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
apologized after she bumped into Olivia
with a box by mistake.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
That apology promoted peace.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you and I realize we’ve hurt someone

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
even unintentionally, what should we do?

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:08.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should make amends quickly.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:11.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
A mother named Marina said this:

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:13.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We try to set a good example
for our children

00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:16.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in forgiving others
. . . and not getting offended.

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:20.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I am wrong, I apologize to my children.

00:11:20.623 --> 00:11:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want them to learn to do the same
in their dealings with others.”

00:11:25.628 --> 00:11:28.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good habit, wouldn’t you agree?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider one more,
a fourth habit:

00:11:31.718 --> 00:11:36.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your family members feel respected.

00:11:36.264 --> 00:11:40.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
An article in the <i>Awake!</i>  magazine
once made this insightful comment:

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Respect is in the eye of the beholder.”

00:11:45.315 --> 00:11:47.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:50.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we think
we’re showing respect in the family,

00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:53.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
good questions to ask ourselves are:

00:11:53.823 --> 00:11:57.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do my family members
feel that I respect them?

00:11:57.327 --> 00:12:01.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is there more I can do to help my mate,
my children, or my parents

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:03.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel loved and respected?’

00:12:05.335 --> 00:12:10.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, when we fulfill
our God-given role in the family

00:12:10.131 --> 00:12:12.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
by developing good habits such as these,

00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:17.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show respect both for Jehovah
and for all of our family members.

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s think about Olivia and her mom.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next video,
note how peace can be restored

00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:27.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
by showing love and respect.

00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:39.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK, Mom.

00:12:40.746 --> 00:12:41.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
You didn’t know.

00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:44.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad did that for her just before he died.

00:12:48.462 --> 00:12:50.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anything I can do to help?

00:12:56.428 --> 00:12:58.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 12:10:

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:03.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:13.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia?

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made your favorite tonight.

00:13:22.246 --> 00:13:23.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:30.963 --> 00:13:35.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell you
that I didn’t handle that so well today.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
You had good reason
to be upset about the desk.

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:45.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, you didn’t know.

00:13:47.688 --> 00:13:50.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just one of those things
that Dad did just for me.

00:13:54.737 --> 00:13:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know he’s my stepdad now, but

00:13:57.907 --> 00:14:00.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just wish he would have checked first.

00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:02.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t Max.

00:14:02.244 --> 00:14:04.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:14:04.955 --> 00:14:09.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to surprise Max
with a place for him to do his work.

00:14:13.422 --> 00:14:16.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he didn’t make you get rid of the desk?

00:14:16.342 --> 00:14:17.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:14:21.347 --> 00:14:24.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought you both didn’t care.

00:14:25.017 --> 00:14:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will never ever stop caring about you.

00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:47.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful outcome!

00:14:47.874 --> 00:14:52.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
The well-being and unity
of the family were restored.

00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:56.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mom, Irene,
applied the principle at Romans 12:10.

00:14:56.466 --> 00:15:01.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
She ‘took the lead,’ or the initiative,
to talk kindly with her daughter.

00:15:01.387 --> 00:15:05.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though Olivia was upset,
she too showed love and respect

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being willing to listen to her mom.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
the misunderstanding was cleared up,

00:15:11.439 --> 00:15:16.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Irene used the opportunity to reassure
her precious daughter of her love,

00:15:16.027 --> 00:15:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying, “I will never ever
stop caring about you.”

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how our hearts were touched

00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:26.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see their warm embrace!

00:15:27.163 --> 00:15:31.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we “take the lead”
in applying Bible principles,

00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:34.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
we promote genuine family peace.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:37.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may all of us be determined

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep showing our family
that we truly love and respect them

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:44.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
in word and action.

00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:48.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now please listen as Brother Robert Luccioni,

00:15:48.643 --> 00:15:52.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Publishing Committee,
considers the next talk

00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:54.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this symposium, with the theme 

00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:59.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace
—Improve Communication.”

00:16:07.746 --> 00:16:09.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our previous talk reminded us

00:16:09.748 --> 00:16:13.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s possible
for a family to enjoy peace,

00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:15.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it takes work.

00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:20.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at one more step
that can help us stay on the road to peace,

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is good communication.

00:16:22.344 --> 00:16:26.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
A family promotes peace
when all the family members communicate

00:16:26.974 --> 00:16:30.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an open, calm, and honest manner.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:34.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does communication help with peace?

00:16:34.648 --> 00:16:39.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a pattern of good communication
keeps a family close.

00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:42.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to identify and address problems

00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:46.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
before these reach a point
that they take peace away.

00:16:46.034 --> 00:16:48.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that may seem obvious.

00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:52.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t it true that we may find
that between work and school,

00:16:52.499 --> 00:16:57.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
the meetings and ministry,
and recreation and just life in general

00:16:57.171 --> 00:17:01.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s hard to find time
to communicate as a family?

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that a challenge in your family?

00:17:03.677 --> 00:17:06.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what habits
hinder family communication.

00:17:19.068 --> 00:17:20.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Steve.

00:17:22.738 --> 00:17:24.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I’m sorry I was late to the meeting.

00:17:26.075 --> 00:17:28.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should have been there
to help out with my assignment.

00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:32.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we got delayed.

00:17:36.502 --> 00:17:37.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re late!

00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:39.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go, kids!

00:17:42.508 --> 00:17:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re coming! Sorry!

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, the family is fine.

00:17:48.472 --> 00:17:51.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody is adjusting really well.

00:17:55.479 --> 00:17:57.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone seen my glasses?

00:18:00.193 --> 00:18:01.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone?

00:18:05.948 --> 00:18:07.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we might be a little out of sync,

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t know

00:18:11.287 --> 00:18:13.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every family has their issues, right?

00:18:18.127 --> 00:18:19.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
You going outside in those?

00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:23.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:27.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, well, thanks for understanding.

00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:29.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:30.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Take care.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, bye-bye.

00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:06.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice some habits
that hinder family communication?

00:19:06.968 --> 00:19:09.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the case of this family, it seems like

00:19:09.304 --> 00:19:12.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
technology is stifling their communication.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they obviously have some things
they need to communicate about

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:20.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
—punctuality, dress and grooming—
but it’s not happening.

00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:22.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while the scenes of them

00:19:22.317 --> 00:19:25.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
all looking at their devices
and ignoring one another

00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:27.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have been a bit humorous,

00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:31.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
did it remind you of your family at times?

00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a good reminder
for us not to let the use of technology

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:40.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
rob our family of our time and attention!

00:19:40.127 --> 00:19:43.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we develop habits

00:19:43.255 --> 00:19:45.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that promote good communication?

00:19:45.882 --> 00:19:50.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the second Bible principle
of this symposium.

00:19:50.137 --> 00:19:53.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn together, please,
to Ephesians chapter 5.

00:19:53.432 --> 00:19:56.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s read verses 15 and 16

00:19:56.602 --> 00:19:59.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ephesians 5:15, 16:

00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:02.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So keep strict watch that how you

00:20:02.024 --> 00:20:06.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“walk is not as unwise but as wise persons,

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:08.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making the best use of your time,

00:20:08.906 --> 00:20:11.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the days are wicked.”

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at two ways
that this Bible principle can help us.

00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:18.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is by making time

00:20:18.749 --> 00:20:20.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have meaningful communication.

00:20:20.751 --> 00:20:23.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice there in verse 16

00:20:23.253 --> 00:20:27.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says “making the best use of your time”?

00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:30.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the study note for this phrase indicates

00:20:30.344 --> 00:20:33.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
the need to ‘buy out the time’
for important things

00:20:33.847 --> 00:20:35.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
from other pursuits.

00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:39.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can this apply
to family communication?

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:43.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this could include
having a plan, or a routine,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
for when we spend time together
as a family each day.

00:20:47.611 --> 00:20:50.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during those times,
we may choose to limit

00:20:50.197 --> 00:20:54.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
our use of technology so that it
does not interfere with communication;

00:20:54.744 --> 00:20:59.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps it’s in the evening
or at a specific mealtime.

00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:02.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother named Aaron stated,

00:21:02.668 --> 00:21:05.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have our evening meal together,

00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:08.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which allows us time to talk
and hear what’s important

00:21:08.007 --> 00:21:10.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
to each member of the family.”

00:21:10.092 --> 00:21:13.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “My wife and I
have arranged our schedules

00:21:13.054 --> 00:21:15.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so we take the boys
to school and pick them up.

00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
This allows us to spend more time with them.”

00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he says,
“My wife and I regularly take walks

00:21:21.938 --> 00:21:24.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and freely talk about our concerns.”

00:21:24.857 --> 00:21:26.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:29.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they’re making good use of their time.

00:21:29.737 --> 00:21:33.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, to do this, they’ve had to buy
that time out from other pursuits.

00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:37.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they have a plan; they have a routine.

00:21:37.161 --> 00:21:40.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what plan, or routine,

00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:45.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
does your family have
for meaningful communication each day?

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t have one, can you start now?

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:54.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at the second way
that this Bible principle can help us.

00:21:54.137 --> 00:21:57.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is by determining when and how

00:21:57.682 --> 00:22:00.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal with problems when they do arise.

00:22:00.768 --> 00:22:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice verse 15 in Ephesians chapter 5

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that we should ‘walk as wise persons.’

00:22:08.151 --> 00:22:11.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means we need
to choose our paths carefully,

00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:16.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing when to go, when to stop,
when to take another route.

00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:19.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can that help us
when problems arise?

00:22:19.746 --> 00:22:21.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a wise person

00:22:21.956 --> 00:22:25.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
generally knows when is and when is not

00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:27.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
a good time to address a problem.

00:22:27.962 --> 00:22:32.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, we all can attest
that when emotions are high,

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:36.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s probably not the best time
to bring up an issue.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father states:

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sometimes we need to wait
and let things cool.

00:22:42.352 --> 00:22:45.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Often a night’s rest
with prayer makes a big difference

00:22:45.647 --> 00:22:49.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we address the issue the next morning.”

00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:51.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a wise person.

00:22:51.444 --> 00:22:54.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
A wise person also listens.

00:22:54.906 --> 00:22:58.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:19 reminds us to “be quick to listen,

00:22:58.952 --> 00:23:02.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
slow to speak, [and] slow to anger.”

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we can go to Jehovah in prayer

00:23:04.124 --> 00:23:07.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask him to help us to really listen,

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:10.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay calm, to stay humble.

00:23:10.505 --> 00:23:13.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister named Dawn states,

00:23:13.842 --> 00:23:16.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When there are problems,
the first thing I do

00:23:16.803 --> 00:23:21.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
is ask Jehovah in prayer to help us
resolve the problem calmly.”

00:23:21.308 --> 00:23:25.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she says, “Then we talk
with the family member privately

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really try to listen
to their side of the issue.”

00:23:29.733 --> 00:23:32.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a wise person.

00:23:32.027 --> 00:23:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
A wise person will also consider the approach

00:23:35.197 --> 00:23:38.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the words that he or she uses.

00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:42.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, rather than telling
our family member that they have a problem,

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:46.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
can we turn it around so that it’s something
that we all need to work on together?

00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:49.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you reassure your family members

00:23:49.378 --> 00:23:53.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you really love them
and you want to understand

00:23:53.173 --> 00:23:55.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
their side of the issue or the problem?

00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:59.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, now, doing this,
we’re not attacking the family member

00:23:59.555 --> 00:24:03.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather,
showing that we’re all in this together.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see benefits of this Bible principle

00:24:06.562 --> 00:24:09.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
in communication in our family, don’t we?

00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:13.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice the two points:
(1) making the best use of our time

00:24:13.861 --> 00:24:18.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (2) walking as wise persons.

00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:23.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, communication will always be
a work in progress,

00:24:23.287 --> 00:24:26.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s worth the effort,
as it will go a long way

00:24:26.457 --> 00:24:29.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bringing peace to your family.

00:24:29.043 --> 00:24:31.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch more of our dramatization

00:24:31.754 --> 00:24:34.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice the benefits of developing habits

00:24:34.882 --> 00:24:37.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
that promote good communication.

00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:43.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

00:24:43.391 --> 00:24:45.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:24:45.101 --> 00:24:48.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all have to work on it.
I know I need to.

00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we approach it that way
with the kids

00:24:51.107 --> 00:24:53.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just be open with them?

00:24:53.192 --> 00:24:55.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds like a good idea.

00:24:56.571 --> 00:25:01.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. So Irene and I have been talking about

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:03.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
communication

00:25:03.161 --> 00:25:05.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our family.

00:25:05.788 --> 00:25:08.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to talk
about our phones and other devices.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not talking about me, are you?

00:25:11.044 --> 00:25:11.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t do that.

00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:12.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no.

00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:13.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that we can all be
more balanced, but . . .

00:25:13.504 --> 00:25:14.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need it.

00:25:14.505 --> 00:25:16.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re joking, right? You mean them.

00:25:16.049 --> 00:25:16.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t take them away.

00:25:16.841 --> 00:25:17.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t done anything bad.

00:25:17.967 --> 00:25:19.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have responsibilities.

00:25:19.093 --> 00:25:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:20.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re always on your phone too.

00:25:20.678 --> 00:25:21.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:22.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

00:25:22.764 --> 00:25:25.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just talk about it, all right?

00:25:27.352 --> 00:25:28.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sue,

00:25:29.562 --> 00:25:33.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you read Ephesians 5:15, 16
for us, please?

00:25:36.903 --> 00:25:39.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So keep strict watch that how you walk

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:43.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is not as unwise but as wise persons,

00:25:43.618 --> 00:25:48.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the best use of your time,
because the days are wicked.”

00:25:49.708 --> 00:25:50.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
So

00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:55.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think we’re doing
with our phones and other devices?

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t that what you’re doing
on your devices is wrong.

00:26:05.932 --> 00:26:07.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:26:07.726 --> 00:26:10.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could it be taking time away
from more important things

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like talking to each other,

00:26:16.026 --> 00:26:19.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in that way affecting even
how we’re talking to each other?

00:26:25.744 --> 00:26:29.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think it’d be smart

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have some boundaries then.

00:26:36.713 --> 00:26:38.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, OK.

00:26:40.884 --> 00:26:42.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:44.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:26:44.721 --> 00:26:46.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about how we can do that.

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:51.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:53.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Olivia.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:26:56.358 --> 00:26:59.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, I haven’t figured out
how to talk to her about her clothes yet.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:27:00.362 --> 00:27:02.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need your help.

00:27:02.114 --> 00:27:04.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got this one.

00:27:07.828 --> 00:27:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know,

00:27:09.955 --> 00:27:13.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s all about good spiritual judgment.

00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:17.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that these trends reflect
Jehovah’s view of “respectable dress”?

00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:22.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that you’ll do the right thing.

00:27:25.804 --> 00:27:26.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:27:27.306 --> 00:27:28.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Gabe, can you take us?

00:27:28.682 --> 00:27:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:27:29.725 --> 00:27:30.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:27:30.976 --> 00:27:33.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we’re all here,

00:27:33.604 --> 00:27:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know we all have
different views on punctuality,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:27:39.068 --> 00:27:40.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really need your help

00:27:40.778 --> 00:27:43.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can take care
of some of my responsibilities.

00:27:44.907 --> 00:27:46.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:48.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:27:48.786 --> 00:27:49.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:27:49.286 --> 00:27:51.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. Great.

00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:14.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this symposium has been discussing

00:28:14.395 --> 00:28:18.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
four Bible principles
that can guide families to peace.

00:28:18.316 --> 00:28:21.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Dellinger considered the first one

00:28:21.027 --> 00:28:23.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 12:10.

00:28:23.362 --> 00:28:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this part, we considered
Ephesians chapter 5,

00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:29.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 15, 16.

00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:33.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did we see how this scripture
helped our family in the video?

00:28:33.915 --> 00:28:37.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we saw that they knew down deep
that they were not making

00:28:37.377 --> 00:28:40.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best use of their time,
so they made changes.

00:28:40.963 --> 00:28:44.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
They saw that they needed to set boundaries

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:46.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could improve
their communication.

00:28:46.886 --> 00:28:50.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also saw how the family
—the parents—acted as wise persons.

00:28:50.932 --> 00:28:51.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:28:51.975 --> 00:28:54.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by determining when and how

00:28:54.686 --> 00:28:57.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
to address the problems
that needed to be addressed,

00:28:57.438 --> 00:29:01.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the use of technology,
dress and grooming,

00:29:01.526 --> 00:29:03.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
and punctuality.

00:29:03.862 --> 00:29:07.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, can this Bible principle
help your family

00:29:07.031 --> 00:29:10.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
—help my family—to improve communication?

00:29:10.326 --> 00:29:12.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would this be a good scripture to include

00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:15.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your next family worship?

00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:20.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it takes time to learn how
to communicate well as a family.

00:29:20.587 --> 00:29:23.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is worth the effort.

00:29:23.048 --> 00:29:24.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:29:24.466 --> 00:29:28.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we strive to communicate
well each day,

00:29:28.136 --> 00:29:31.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
then communication will come more readily

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there are problems.

00:29:33.642 --> 00:29:36.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be determined to look for ways

00:29:36.603 --> 00:29:39.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
to improve communication in your family.

00:29:39.773 --> 00:29:42.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by taking this initiative
and sticking with it,

00:29:42.984 --> 00:29:45.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will be following the road map

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to family peace.

00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:52.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please listen now to Brother David Splane,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:56.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he considers the next talk
of this symposium,

00:29:56.039 --> 00:30:00.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace
—Work as a Team.”

00:30:08.635 --> 00:30:12.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah intended married couples
to work together.

00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:15.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Jesus used the expression we find

00:30:15.183 --> 00:30:18.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 19:6.

00:30:18.103 --> 00:30:23.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read this from the Bible
—Matthew 19.

00:30:23.025 --> 00:30:25.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ll give you a moment.

00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:30.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 19
—now, we’re going to read verse 6.

00:30:32.534 --> 00:30:35.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first of all, Jesus quotes

00:30:35.079 --> 00:30:37.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Genesis 2:24.

00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:40.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of married couples, he says:

00:30:40.417 --> 00:30:44.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.”

00:30:44.296 --> 00:30:49.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you remember, Jehovah
made that comment in the garden of Eden.

00:30:49.051 --> 00:30:53.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Jesus adds something
that isn’t in Genesis.

00:30:53.264 --> 00:30:58.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Therefore, what God has yoked

00:30:58.227 --> 00:31:01.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[yoked] together,

00:31:01.021 --> 00:31:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
let no man put apart.”

00:31:04.608 --> 00:31:08.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think of a yoke,
we may think of a team of horses

00:31:08.612 --> 00:31:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
plowing a field or pulling a heavy wagon.

00:31:11.699 --> 00:31:15.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if they pull together,
they can be a powerful force.

00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:19.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true
when family members work together.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, Dad

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:28.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you have excellent reasons to work together.

00:31:28.924 --> 00:31:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you work together,
you contribute to the peace of the family.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think of the effect
it has on the children.

00:31:36.182 --> 00:31:40.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
By working together, you’re teaching
that fine young son of yours

00:31:40.186 --> 00:31:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to be a caring husband and father,

00:31:42.438 --> 00:31:47.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your beautiful daughter how to be
a supportive wife and mother.

00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:52.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happens when teammates
begin pulling in opposite directions

00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:54.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when one puts on the brakes?

00:31:54.742 --> 00:31:56.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch a video.

00:31:56.786 --> 00:31:58.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the setup.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:03.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a long time, a sister raised
her two children as a single parent,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she did a great job of it.

00:32:05.378 --> 00:32:09.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she married a very kind brother.

00:32:09.215 --> 00:32:11.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
The family has a new head.

00:32:11.217 --> 00:32:15.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how well the sister
is adapting to her new role.

00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:23.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last few weeks of family worship
have been nice,

00:32:23.521 --> 00:32:25.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
right?

00:32:25.273 --> 00:32:26.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:32:26.858 --> 00:32:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these things we ask and pray
in Jesus’ name, Amen.

00:32:30.653 --> 00:32:31.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.

00:32:35.617 --> 00:32:36.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, this week . . .

00:32:36.576 --> 00:32:39.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are in chapter 5.

00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:40.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yep, that’s right.

00:32:40.663 --> 00:32:42.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last week, Gabe read, so this week . . .

00:32:42.916 --> 00:32:44.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Sue’s turn.

00:32:45.085 --> 00:32:47.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.
It’s Sue’s turn.

00:32:48.922 --> 00:32:50.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, the point here is
that when it comes . . .

00:32:50.924 --> 00:32:54.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honey, maybe an illustration would be better.

00:32:55.595 --> 00:32:58.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, OK.

00:32:59.766 --> 00:33:01.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like a bird . . .

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, hopefully I was able to clear that up
for you a little bit, Olivia.

00:33:04.229 --> 00:33:06.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thank you.

00:33:06.022 --> 00:33:08.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, actually, Max, that’s not true.

00:33:08.692 --> 00:33:11.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had an updated understanding
in the recent <i>Watchtower.</i>

00:33:13.864 --> 00:33:15.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:33:19.453 --> 00:33:23.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think they went really well, right?

00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:27.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, actually . . .

00:33:31.214 --> 00:33:32.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:33:34.801 --> 00:33:36.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we can talk about it later.

00:33:38.347 --> 00:33:39.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:33:53.862 --> 00:33:56.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister isn’t a bad person.

00:33:56.406 --> 00:33:59.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can ask:
What is she teaching her daughter

00:33:59.284 --> 00:34:01.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the wife’s role in the family?

00:34:01.537 --> 00:34:04.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is her son learning
about taking the lead

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:06.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the man of the house?

00:34:06.083 --> 00:34:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t had a man
in his life for a long time.

00:34:09.378 --> 00:34:11.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now there is one.

00:34:11.422 --> 00:34:14.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s safe to say that the kids
will stand a better chance

00:34:14.341 --> 00:34:16.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
of having a successful marriage themselves

00:34:16.802 --> 00:34:20.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they see their parents pulling together.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:24.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little later, we’ll see how
the husband handles the situation,

00:34:24.518 --> 00:34:27.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we brothers
are going to want to pay attention.

00:34:27.271 --> 00:34:29.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a classic.

00:34:31.442 --> 00:34:34.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family life is more pleasant when Dad, Mom,

00:34:34.987 --> 00:34:38.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the kids work together as a team.

00:34:38.032 --> 00:34:40.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
The family head is the captain.

00:34:40.201 --> 00:34:42.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
He needs to make sure that everyone knows

00:34:42.328 --> 00:34:44.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
what goals the family is working toward

00:34:44.663 --> 00:34:49.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how each one can contribute
toward achieving those goals.

00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:52.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it’s your family’s turn
to help clean the Kingdom Hall

00:34:52.296 --> 00:34:54.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a convention venue, for example,

00:34:54.924 --> 00:34:56.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t leave the kids at home.

00:34:56.968 --> 00:34:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re part of the team.

00:34:58.594 --> 00:35:00.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t go there with half the team.

00:35:00.846 --> 00:35:05.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let them experience the joy
that comes from serving others.

00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:07.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let them work along with you.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re assigned to clean the restrooms,

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t complain about it—a very fine example.

00:35:12.817 --> 00:35:17.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your children will learn that when
there’s work to be done, we just do it.

00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:22.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
We aren’t picky about what we will
and will not do.

00:35:22.118 --> 00:35:25.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t feel
that some jobs are beneath us.

00:35:25.663 --> 00:35:27.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is in line with Paul’s counsel

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:32.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Philippians 2:3, 4.

00:35:33.254 --> 00:35:35.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look that up.

00:35:35.465 --> 00:35:37.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good exercise

00:35:37.759 --> 00:35:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Philippians chapter 2,

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 3, 4.

00:35:44.849 --> 00:35:48.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re thinking about the family
as a team here.

00:35:48.102 --> 00:35:52.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Do nothing out of contentiousness

00:35:52.065 --> 00:35:54.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or out of egotism,

00:35:54.484 --> 00:35:59.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but with humility consider
others superior to you,

00:35:59.405 --> 00:36:03.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as you look out
not only for your own interests,

00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:06.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:36:07.205 --> 00:36:10.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
When there’s work to be done,
someone has to do it.

00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:15.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do I think that I’m so special
that someone else has to look after it?

00:36:16.506 --> 00:36:19.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some families volunteer
to help with Kingdom Hall maintenance.

00:36:19.968 --> 00:36:22.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the kids are old enough,
they can work on other projects

00:36:22.637 --> 00:36:24.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
like working on an Assembly Hall.

00:36:24.598 --> 00:36:26.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a ball!

00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:29.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
The friendships that you
and your young people will forge

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:31.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
can last a lifetime.

00:36:31.646 --> 00:36:33.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s a bonus: When the young people

00:36:33.982 --> 00:36:36.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to a circuit assembly
or a regional convention,

00:36:36.776 --> 00:36:39.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll have good friends to associate with

00:36:39.529 --> 00:36:44.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both young and old—
people they’ve been working with.

00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:49.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about working around the house?

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:53.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some parents feel that the children
shouldn’t have to help out at all

00:36:53.126 --> 00:36:56.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they have their schoolwork to do.

00:36:56.046 --> 00:36:58.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
But their schoolwork is something
they do for themselves.

00:36:58.924 --> 00:37:02.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are they contributing
to the welfare of the family?

00:37:02.427 --> 00:37:06.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are they learning
to serve others unselfishly?

00:37:06.306 --> 00:37:11.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good for a child to feel that he has
an important role in the household

00:37:11.061 --> 00:37:13.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that people are counting on him.

00:37:13.313 --> 00:37:17.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think what that does for his self-respect.

00:37:17.067 --> 00:37:19.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
A father named Steven said,

00:37:19.611 --> 00:37:22.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When nothing is expected of them,

00:37:22.072 --> 00:37:24.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“children learn that they
are here to be served,

00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:27.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they grow up with a distorted view

00:37:27.494 --> 00:37:30.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what life will require of them.”

00:37:31.665 --> 00:37:34.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might ask, Would a young person

00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:36.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that attitude
even be able to keep a job?

00:37:38.213 --> 00:37:40.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
When some in the world lose their job,

00:37:40.633 --> 00:37:43.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
they remain unemployed for a long time.

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:45.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can’t pay the bills.

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:48.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, there are job opportunities
all around them,

00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:52.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they consider those jobs beneath them.

00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:56.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s one of the most annoying traits
an employee can have?

00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:58.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask any boss.

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:01.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the worker is asked to do something,
he replies,

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That’s not my job.”

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:08.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teach your child that anything
that needs to be done

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:12.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
is his job if he’s old enough
and capable of doing it.

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:18.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
How early should parents
start to assign chores to their children?

00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:21.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some experts have found that children who are

00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:24.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
three years old or even younger

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:27.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be taught to help out.

00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:32.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can learn to pick up their toys,
clean up spills, sort laundry.

00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:34.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Older children can vacuum,

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
wash the car, prepare a meal.

00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:40.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m happy to say that many young brothers
here at Bethel

00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:43.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
are excellent cooks,
which is often the result

00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:47.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
of fine parental training.

00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:49.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember the video where Caleb

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
is taught to clean his room
and put away his toys?

00:38:52.205 --> 00:38:55.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
That video was a game changer
for many children.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to be just like Caleb.

00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:03.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now when you enter their room,
you can find the bed.

00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:09.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
When problems arise,
attack the problem, not each other.

00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:14.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not ‘How can I win?’
but ‘How can we win?’

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:18.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll see an excellent example of that
in the follow-up video.

00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:19.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:34.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Want some tea?

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:35.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:39:42.964 --> 00:39:44.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, babe,

00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:47.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
you and me, we’re a team, right?

00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:53.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read this, I thought about us.

00:39:56.728 --> 00:40:01.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.”

00:40:03.235 --> 00:40:07.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that before, you had to shoulder
everything yourself for so long.

00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:08.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you did great.

00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:15.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been raising two beautiful,
spiritual kids on your own.

00:40:16.957 --> 00:40:18.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now you have me.

00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:20.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.

00:40:21.336 --> 00:40:24.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do you think
sometimes we’re not a team?

00:40:24.673 --> 00:40:26.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s just that sometimes
during family worship . . .

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:30.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I get excited, and I jump in. I know!

00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:33.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just so used to doing it
after all these years.

00:40:33.891 --> 00:40:36.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re not trying to take over.

00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And listen, I love the way you teach.

00:40:38.604 --> 00:40:40.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see how you can reach the kids

00:40:40.606 --> 00:40:42.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that I can’t.

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:47.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just let me guide it,
and I’ll make sure you can do that.

00:40:48.238 --> 00:40:51.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, honey. Thanks for your patience.

00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, thank you for your patience.

00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:57.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a work in progress,
but we make a great team.

00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:03.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we look at what we’re going
to cover before our next family worship?

00:41:03.629 --> 00:41:05.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds great.

00:41:10.678 --> 00:41:12.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that a fine example

00:41:12.846 --> 00:41:16.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how to attack a problem and not your mate?

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
No arguments, no raised voices,

00:41:19.687 --> 00:41:24.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
no accusations
—the husband had empathy for his wife.

00:41:24.525 --> 00:41:26.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t question her motives.

00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:28.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
He realized that as a single parent,

00:41:28.487 --> 00:41:31.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’d been taking the lead for a long time.

00:41:31.949 --> 00:41:36.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice how she responded
to her husband’s kind counsel.

00:41:36.287 --> 00:41:40.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt it’s going to be easy
for the kids to respect their stepfather,

00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:44.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re going to learn
how a husband and wife

00:41:44.003 --> 00:41:47.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
should treat each other
and how they should pull together.

00:41:49.008 --> 00:41:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime soon, you might want
to consider these questions:

00:41:53.429 --> 00:41:58.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what aspects of our marriage
do we work well as a team?

00:41:58.059 --> 00:42:02.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, how can we improve?

00:42:02.104 --> 00:42:04.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
It pleases Jehovah

00:42:04.315 --> 00:42:07.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
when family members work together as a team.

00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:09.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
That promotes peace in the family.

00:42:09.904 --> 00:42:14.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our God is a “God of peace.”

00:42:15.743 --> 00:42:18.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now Brother John Ekrann

00:42:18.538 --> 00:42:21.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
will consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:24.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace

00:42:24.669 --> 00:42:27.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Worship Jehovah Together.”

00:42:35.763 --> 00:42:39.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants your family
to be happy and peaceful.

00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:41.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah does more than simply say,

00:42:41.436 --> 00:42:44.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I hope you have a peaceful family life.”

00:42:44.063 --> 00:42:48.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explains exactly how we
can get our family there.

00:42:48.401 --> 00:42:51.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to imagine Jehovah
laying out a map in front of you

00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:53.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saying: “See these landmarks?

00:42:53.823 --> 00:42:56.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look for them on the road to peace.

00:42:56.284 --> 00:42:59.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you see them,
you’re going in the right direction.”

00:43:00.455 --> 00:43:02.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far in this symposium, we’ve passed

00:43:02.624 --> 00:43:05.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
the landmarks of showing love and respect,

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
improving communication,

00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:09.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and working together as a team.

00:43:09.798 --> 00:43:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last landmark
we’ll consider in this symposium

00:43:13.176 --> 00:43:16.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
is worshipping together as a family.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Worshipping together as a family

00:43:19.307 --> 00:43:22.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
promotes peace and brings his blessing.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if not all in your family
are worshippers of Jehovah,

00:43:25.272 --> 00:43:29.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can promote peace
by maintaining a very good spiritual routine.

00:43:30.652 --> 00:43:34.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,
notice some common obstacles

00:43:34.322 --> 00:43:36.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:41.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:43:42.205 --> 00:43:43.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, babe.

00:43:43.957 --> 00:43:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s for family worship this week?

00:43:54.009 --> 00:43:56.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I got some good ideas.

00:43:56.386 --> 00:43:57.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:43:57.804 --> 00:43:58.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:43:58.972 --> 00:44:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for reading that.

00:44:00.474 --> 00:44:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um.

00:44:04.061 --> 00:44:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just go ahead and ask the question.
We’ll just do that.

00:44:06.772 --> 00:44:09.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
So paragraphs 13 and 14:
“How can we be generous?”

00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:14.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anybody?

00:44:15.948 --> 00:44:20.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the footnote that we just read
really helps us to appreciate

00:44:20.285 --> 00:44:23.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
the definition of that quality.

00:44:23.205 --> 00:44:26.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the definition, we’re left to wonder

00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:29.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
exactly what it is
and how it connects to the other things

00:44:29.128 --> 00:44:31.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve discussed this evening.

00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:36.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe, can you go ahead
and read the next one for us?

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:37.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:44:37.428 --> 00:44:38.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:44:40.514 --> 00:44:45.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains many examples
of submissive individuals.

00:44:46.145 --> 00:44:48.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
So are there examples?

00:44:52.443 --> 00:44:53.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sue.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:55.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:44:55.154 --> 00:44:57.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we talk about examples,
where do we start?

00:44:58.073 --> 00:44:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are examples in the past;

00:44:59.742 --> 00:45:03.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are even examples presently.

00:45:03.454 --> 00:45:07.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we could even be examples.

00:45:07.666 --> 00:45:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s—that’s the power of them.

00:45:14.548 --> 00:45:16.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep going.

00:45:24.767 --> 00:45:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a lot of reading.

00:45:26.477 --> 00:45:27.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:45:28.604 --> 00:45:31.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to enjoy family worship, but

00:45:31.148 --> 00:45:34.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like the things that we are covering

00:45:34.235 --> 00:45:37.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
are just really not what I need right now.

00:45:38.614 --> 00:45:39.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:45:41.451 --> 00:45:44.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, I just don’t know
if this is what they need right now.

00:45:44.662 --> 00:45:45.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:45:45.997 --> 00:45:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll keep working on it.

00:45:56.841 --> 00:46:00.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we’d all agree that family worship
was difficult to watch.

00:46:00.386 --> 00:46:02.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was uncomfortable for everyone.

00:46:02.931 --> 00:46:05.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Max and Irene had some obstacles

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
they needed to overcome
to really worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:46:10.605 --> 00:46:12.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
To start and keep a good habit going

00:46:12.815 --> 00:46:15.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires determination and resolve.

00:46:15.568 --> 00:46:18.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s where you need
to start for your family.

00:46:18.071 --> 00:46:20.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need to resolve

00:46:20.073 --> 00:46:23.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’re going
to worship Jehovah as a family.

00:46:23.118 --> 00:46:25.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the resolve in Joshua’s words

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Joshua 24:15.

00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:33.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Joshua 24:15:

00:46:35.338 --> 00:46:38.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah,

00:46:38.466 --> 00:46:42.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“choose for yourselves today
whom you will serve,

00:46:42.637 --> 00:46:47.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether the gods that your forefathers
served on the other side of the River

00:46:47.058 --> 00:46:51.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or the gods of the Amorites
in whose land you are dwelling.

00:46:51.062 --> 00:46:54.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But as for me and my household,

00:46:54.107 --> 00:46:56.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will serve Jehovah.”

00:46:58.528 --> 00:47:01.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, worship of Jehovah as a family

00:47:01.156 --> 00:47:04.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs to be at the very center
of your family life.

00:47:04.493 --> 00:47:06.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, weekly family worship

00:47:06.495 --> 00:47:09.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not all that’s involved
in worshipping together as a family.

00:47:09.664 --> 00:47:11.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider five ways

00:47:11.833 --> 00:47:15.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can worship Jehovah together as a family.

00:47:15.796 --> 00:47:18.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Prayer.

00:47:18.423 --> 00:47:21.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, do not underestimate the impact

00:47:21.927 --> 00:47:24.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your prayers have on your children.

00:47:24.888 --> 00:47:28.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a child hears their parents
pour out their hearts to Jehovah,

00:47:28.642 --> 00:47:32.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that tells them that Jehovah
is very real to their parents.

00:47:32.896 --> 00:47:36.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can recall growing up listening
to my father’s prayers.

00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:40.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when I was young,
I thought his prayers were very long.

00:47:40.988 --> 00:47:45.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as I grew older and really
listened carefully to what he was saying,

00:47:45.826 --> 00:47:50.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could see how much of a close relationship
he had with Jehovah.

00:47:52.124 --> 00:47:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Discuss the daily text.

00:47:55.044 --> 00:47:57.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an excellent habit

00:47:57.046 --> 00:47:59.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a very spiritual way to start the day.

00:48:00.799 --> 00:48:03.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Attend meetings.

00:48:03.135 --> 00:48:06.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re not just making sure our family
is there at the meetings

00:48:06.472 --> 00:48:09.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that they’re involved and engaged.

00:48:09.183 --> 00:48:11.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And work hard to prepare
so that all family members

00:48:11.894 --> 00:48:14.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have a meaningful comment
at the meetings.

00:48:15.773 --> 00:48:20.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) Share in the ministry regularly
as a family.

00:48:20.236 --> 00:48:22.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sharing in the ministry together
as a family

00:48:22.863 --> 00:48:25.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us closer to our family members.

00:48:25.449 --> 00:48:28.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we hear them speak about the truth,

00:48:28.202 --> 00:48:30.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
we listen to their phone calls,

00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:32.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we read their letters,

00:48:32.665 --> 00:48:35.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can feel their faith.

00:48:35.334 --> 00:48:37.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved going in the ministry with my mother

00:48:37.962 --> 00:48:41.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listening to her skillfully use the Bible

00:48:41.048 --> 00:48:43.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
to answer questions.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:46.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
And (5) have a consistent,

00:48:46.971 --> 00:48:51.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyable,
and meaningful Family Worship program.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:55.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what that means
—first of all, consistent.

00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:57.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, Max was trying to have

00:48:57.481 --> 00:49:00.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
the family worship consistently each week.

00:49:00.318 --> 00:49:03.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your family worship consistent each week?

00:49:04.655 --> 00:49:07.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your family worship enjoyable?

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, the kids were bored.

00:49:09.869 --> 00:49:13.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were looking at their phones
and checking the time.

00:49:13.664 --> 00:49:17.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And week after week
of kind of a question-and-answer style

00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:20.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
led to the young people
giving sort of one-word answers.

00:49:20.838 --> 00:49:23.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It did not look enjoyable.

00:49:23.257 --> 00:49:27.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, would your family
describe family worship as enjoyable?

00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:31.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about meaningful?

00:49:31.558 --> 00:49:33.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Max was using for material

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
was material that he thought was meaningful.

00:49:37.105 --> 00:49:41.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did it look like it 
was meaningful to the family?

00:49:41.401 --> 00:49:45.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does your family worship use material
that is meaningful to your family?

00:49:47.323 --> 00:49:49.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, after reviewing these five points,

00:49:49.993 --> 00:49:52.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t want you to be discouraged

00:49:52.328 --> 00:49:55.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it’s a struggle
to maintain a good routine.

00:49:55.498 --> 00:49:57.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life in this system has many challenges,

00:49:57.792 --> 00:50:00.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
trials, and unexpected events.

00:50:00.628 --> 00:50:02.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stay positive.

00:50:02.839 --> 00:50:05.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when your good routine
breaks down from time to time,

00:50:05.967 --> 00:50:08.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider what adjustments you can make

00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:13.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be successful and get
your spiritual routine back on track.

00:50:13.225 --> 00:50:17.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regularly ask Jehovah for his help,
and don’t give up.

00:50:18.188 --> 00:50:20.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you watch
the following dramatization,

00:50:20.607 --> 00:50:24.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Max and Irene
and the family worked together

00:50:24.152 --> 00:50:27.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make family worship successful.

00:50:31.785 --> 00:50:35.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
March 15, 2014, <i>Watchtower, </i>

00:50:36.331 --> 00:50:39.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Family Worship
—Can you Make It More Enjoyable?”:

00:50:40.669 --> 00:50:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The worship of Jehovah
should not be boring. . . .

00:50:44.881 --> 00:50:48.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Address the needs of each family member.”

00:50:52.514 --> 00:50:54.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babe, what do our kids need?

00:50:56.435 --> 00:50:58.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s actually going on in their lives?

00:50:59.354 --> 00:51:01.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family worship needs to include that.

00:51:03.484 --> 00:51:06.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe we need to pay more attention
to what’s going on with them.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to them; listen to them.

00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:16.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to send you a link
to a great <i>Watchtower</i>  article.

00:51:16.205 --> 00:51:18.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to read it.

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:23.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Max and I changed our approach.

00:51:27.758 --> 00:51:30.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
We found out what mattered to our kids

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like friends,

00:51:35.474 --> 00:51:38.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . adjusting to a blended family,

00:51:40.354 --> 00:51:42.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . dating.

00:51:48.779 --> 00:51:51.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we turned things around
and used family worship

00:51:51.115 --> 00:51:54.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on what our kids really needed

00:52:08.716 --> 00:52:11.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prepare ourselves
for possible future trials.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night, y’all.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:52:28.569 --> 00:52:29.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:30.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:52:30.905 --> 00:52:31.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um,

00:52:33.449 --> 00:52:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
family worship was—was cool.

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:38.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was.

00:52:38.079 --> 00:52:40.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad you liked it.

00:52:40.331 --> 00:52:41.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:52:41.624 --> 00:52:42.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night, y’all.

00:52:42.667 --> 00:52:43.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Night.

00:52:43.459 --> 00:52:44.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good night.

00:52:45.211 --> 00:52:46.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey! Guess what?

00:52:46.713 --> 00:52:48.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:52:48.047 --> 00:52:49.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:52:49.841 --> 00:52:51.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
I applied to Bethel.

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:52.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did?

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:53.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s really exciting.

00:52:58.057 --> 00:52:59.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m proud of you.

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:00.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:04.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, congratulations.

00:53:04.606 --> 00:53:05.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:10.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, it’s selfie time, everybody.
Come on, let’s get together.

00:53:10.862 --> 00:53:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right. On three
we’re going to say Bethel, OK?

00:53:13.656 --> 00:53:15.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
One, two, three.

00:53:17.786 --> 00:53:19.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethel!

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:41.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve come a long way.

00:53:53.488 --> 00:53:55.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And through it all,

00:53:55.282 --> 00:53:57.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has taught us to love

00:53:58.577 --> 00:54:01.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given our family

00:54:01.079 --> 00:54:02.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace.

00:55:15.821 --> 00:55:19.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see that Max and Irene analyzed
what was wrong with family worship

00:55:19.533 --> 00:55:22.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided to change their approach.

00:55:22.578 --> 00:55:26.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s examine how they did that
and what it means for us.

00:55:26.916 --> 00:55:29.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did they do to make their

00:55:29.585 --> 00:55:32.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
family worship more meaningful?

00:55:32.296 --> 00:55:35.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Max and Irene had to ask themselves

00:55:35.174 --> 00:55:38.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was going on in their kids’ lives.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
What topics could they
discuss at family worship

00:55:41.097 --> 00:55:44.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would truly be useful to their kids?

00:55:44.058 --> 00:55:47.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you smile when you saw Max
almost drop the glass

00:55:47.645 --> 00:55:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
when his daughter talked about dating?

00:55:50.606 --> 00:55:53.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a difference their efforts to listen

00:55:53.693 --> 00:55:55.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really understand what was happening

00:55:55.945 --> 00:55:59.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the kids made in the family worship!

00:55:59.282 --> 00:56:03.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Max and Irene
make family worship more enjoyable?

00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:08.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how the family
was reacting at family worship now?

00:56:08.082 --> 00:56:10.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a difference!

00:56:10.084 --> 00:56:12.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
The kids were smiling.

00:56:12.128 --> 00:56:14.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
They looked engaged in the discussion

00:56:14.339 --> 00:56:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and touched by what they were discussing.

00:56:17.634 --> 00:56:20.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do what you can
to make sure that your family

00:56:20.845 --> 00:56:23.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
feels relaxed and happy

00:56:23.139 --> 00:56:25.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that your family worship reflects

00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:28.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
the kind of happy
and joyful God that Jehovah is.

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:31.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, your family will often remember

00:56:31.648 --> 00:56:34.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
more about how they felt
during family worship

00:56:34.818 --> 00:56:38.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
than maybe the exact details
of what they learned.

00:56:39.948 --> 00:56:42.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:56:42.367 --> 00:56:44.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make your family worship consistent,

00:56:44.744 --> 00:56:47.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoyable, and meaningful.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:51.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
And work together to overcome obstacles,

00:56:51.418 --> 00:56:56.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Max and Irene and the kids
all worked together to solve problems

00:56:56.381 --> 00:56:59.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and create a very peaceful family life.

00:56:59.426 --> 00:57:01.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was really beautiful to see how far

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:04.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had come by applying Bible principles.

00:57:05.849 --> 00:57:09.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
In review, this symposium has taught us

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Bible principles can be used

00:57:11.313 --> 00:57:14.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a road map to family peace.

00:57:14.482 --> 00:57:17.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work hard to show love and respect,

00:57:17.402 --> 00:57:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
to improve communication,
to work together as a team,

00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:24.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to worship Jehovah together.

00:57:24.576 --> 00:57:28.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please be patient with one another

00:57:28.246 --> 00:57:31.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you form habits that lead to peace.

00:57:31.541 --> 00:57:33.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s help, you and your family

00:57:33.877 --> 00:57:37.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
will enjoy peace that only he can provide.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers.

00:57:41.259 --> 00:57:44.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
We benefited from thinking
about how we can apply

00:57:44.263 --> 00:57:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible principles you shared

00:57:46.431 --> 00:57:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the practical lessons
in the dramatizations.

00:57:52.187 --> 00:57:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us long to see true peace on earth.

00:57:56.483 --> 00:57:58.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will that be accomplished?

00:57:58.777 --> 00:58:01.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can we prove
that we honor and support

00:58:01.572 --> 00:58:05.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s appointed King, Christ Jesus?

00:58:05.451 --> 00:58:10.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s listen as Brother Mark Noumair,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:58:10.205 --> 00:58:13.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides these answers and more in the talk,

00:58:13.959 --> 00:58:17.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Loyally Support the ‘Prince of Peace.’”

00:58:25.179 --> 00:58:29.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the scene: It’s nighttime.

00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:34.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re in the garden of Gethsemane
with your close friends and beloved Teacher.

00:58:34.063 --> 00:58:37.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, you hear a crowd coming.

00:58:37.274 --> 00:58:41.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re being led by a man you know,
Judas Iscariot.

00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:44.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approaches Jesus
and kisses him on the cheek.

00:58:44.782 --> 00:58:49.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then steps aside
as men move in to arrest Jesus.

00:58:49.745 --> 00:58:52.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your emotions churn inside you.

00:58:52.081 --> 00:58:55.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your Master and Lord is being arrested
—the Son of God.

00:58:55.918 --> 00:58:57.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can this be happening?

00:58:57.753 --> 00:58:59.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you do?

00:58:59.255 --> 00:59:02.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you can even decide what to do,

00:59:02.633 --> 00:59:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter draws his sword

00:59:04.635 --> 00:59:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chops off the ear
of the slave of the high priest.

00:59:08.639 --> 00:59:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jesus says to Peter:

00:59:11.434 --> 00:59:15.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return your sword to its place,

00:59:15.855 --> 00:59:20.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all those who take up the sword
will perish by the sword.”

00:59:21.527 --> 00:59:24.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then you watch the unbelievable,

00:59:24.739 --> 00:59:28.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus heals the man’s ear.

00:59:28.534 --> 00:59:31.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter must have thought
that it was a great and noble thing

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:34.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fight on behalf of the Son of God.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus didn’t think so.

00:59:36.918 --> 00:59:39.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
With six words

00:59:39.045 --> 00:59:43.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“return your sword to its place”—

00:59:43.424 --> 00:59:46.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus taught his disciples
an important lesson.

00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:50.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not their fight;

00:59:50.265 --> 00:59:52.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor was it the time to fight.

00:59:53.977 --> 00:59:56.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in this talk,

00:59:56.396 --> 01:00:00.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to focus our attention
on an insidious way

01:00:00.608 --> 01:00:03.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that any of us, like Peter,

01:00:03.611 --> 01:00:08.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
can become inadvertently involved
in this world’s conflicts

01:00:08.533 --> 01:00:10.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
without even realizing it.

01:00:10.869 --> 01:00:15.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will talk about how we
can avoid making that serious mistake.

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first,

01:00:18.543 --> 01:00:22.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s discuss why Jesus
did not ask his Father

01:00:22.464 --> 01:00:25.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send “12 legions of angels”

01:00:25.258 --> 01:00:27.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him when being arrested.

01:00:27.719 --> 01:00:31.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to do with Jesus’ name.

01:00:31.723 --> 01:00:35.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please open your Bible
to Isaiah chapter 9,

01:00:35.393 --> 01:00:38.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 6

01:00:38.647 --> 01:00:42.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 9:6.

01:00:42.192 --> 01:00:46.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know Jesus has many titles,

01:00:46.112 --> 01:00:50.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in this verse,
we’re going to focus on just one.

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 6:

01:00:53.787 --> 01:00:56.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For a child has been born to us,

01:00:56.873 --> 01:00:59.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a son has been given to us;

01:00:59.418 --> 01:01:02.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the rulership will rest on his shoulder.

01:01:02.546 --> 01:01:05.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His name will be called Wonderful Counselor,

01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:07.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mighty God, Eternal Father,

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:09.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prince of Peace.”

01:01:10.846 --> 01:01:15.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is Jesus called “Prince of Peace”?

01:01:15.058 --> 01:01:19.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider what Jehovah’s angel
 declared to the shepherds in the field

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jesus’ birth at Luke 2:14.

01:01:24.485 --> 01:01:27.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said:
“Glory in the heights above to God,

01:01:27.946 --> 01:01:32.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on earth peace among men of goodwill.”

01:01:32.493 --> 01:01:35.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
How appropriate for the angels to announce

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at the birth
of the destined Prince of Peace,

01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:41.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
there would be divine peace
for those who have God’s goodwill!

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:46.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when will this become a reality?

01:01:46.215 --> 01:01:48.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t happen when Jesus was on earth,

01:01:48.801 --> 01:01:51.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we certainly don’t see peace today.

01:01:51.679 --> 01:01:53.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of peace, what do we see?

01:01:53.806 --> 01:01:57.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see the nations that are locked
in hostilities and aggression

01:01:57.101 --> 01:01:59.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a competition for world dominance.

01:01:59.853 --> 01:02:03.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see global violence and bloodshed.

01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:06.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
But please don’t lose heart.

01:02:06.819 --> 01:02:11.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we don’t see peace now
does not mean it’s not coming.

01:02:11.073 --> 01:02:13.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 9:6

01:02:13.993 --> 01:02:16.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s not just wishful thinking.

01:02:16.328 --> 01:02:21.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a promise from Almighty God,
and Jehovah cannot lie.

01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:23.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
All his prophecies come true.

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
let’s read the last portion of verse 7

01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Isaiah chapter 9.

01:02:29.592 --> 01:02:34.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last verse
(the last portion of verse 7) says:

01:02:34.013 --> 01:02:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.”

01:02:37.725 --> 01:02:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

01:02:39.727 --> 01:02:42.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that Jehovah
does nothing in a half-hearted way.

01:02:42.688 --> 01:02:45.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s zealous to bring peace, and he will.

01:02:45.316 --> 01:02:48.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure
that whatever Jehovah promises,

01:02:48.945 --> 01:02:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will fully accomplish.

01:02:53.157 --> 01:02:55.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how will peace come to the earth?

01:02:56.619 --> 01:02:59.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the Prince of Peace give us a clue?

01:02:59.205 --> 01:03:00.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he did.

01:03:00.748 --> 01:03:03.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the key to everlasting peace

01:03:03.793 --> 01:03:07.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
is on the lips of millions of people
throughout the world.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:09.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know it by heart.

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:14.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s read it at Matthew 6:9, 10

01:03:17.849 --> 01:03:21.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:9.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful thought for us!

01:03:23.062 --> 01:03:25.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is how everlasting peace
is going to come through.

01:03:25.899 --> 01:03:30.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
It depends on the fulfillment
of these verses.

01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:32.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 9:

01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:36.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must pray, then, this way:
‘Our Father in the heavens,

01:03:36.201 --> 01:03:41.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
let your name [the name Jehovah]
be sanctified.’”

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:44.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The emphasis that we place
on the name of God

01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:46.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not merely a matter
of religious knowledge.

01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:49.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone must know God’s name

01:03:49.089 --> 01:03:52.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
and treat it as something holy and respected.

01:03:52.342 --> 01:03:54.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be something sacred.

01:03:54.844 --> 01:03:58.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must be cleared of all the reproach
that has been heaped upon it.

01:03:59.474 --> 01:04:04.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the well-being
of the entire universe and its inhabitants

01:04:04.437 --> 01:04:08.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
depends upon the sanctification
of Jehovah’s name.

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:12.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at verse 10:

01:04:12.904 --> 01:04:15.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your Kingdom come.

01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:20.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let your will take place,
as in heaven, also on earth.”

01:04:21.663 --> 01:04:26.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom
—two words but so important.

01:04:27.669 --> 01:04:31.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom
is the most powerful government

01:04:31.256 --> 01:04:33.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
humanity will ever see.

01:04:33.508 --> 01:04:35.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no nation or empire

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:39.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can withstand
the might of God’s Kingdom.

01:04:39.765 --> 01:04:44.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And any nation who thinks
they can block the coming of God’s Kingdom

01:04:44.686 --> 01:04:49.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like an ant who plants itself firmly
on the railroad track

01:04:49.691 --> 01:04:54.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with his hand raised defiantly
shouts to the oncoming locomotive:

01:04:54.238 --> 01:04:56.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop! You can’t run over me.”

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, God’s heavenly government has the power

01:05:00.452 --> 01:05:03.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy all present-day violent regimes.

01:05:03.288 --> 01:05:06.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re like ants to Jehovah.

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:08.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he will eliminate their ability

01:05:08.085 --> 01:05:12.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
to wage war, to foment conflict,
and to shed blood.

01:05:12.923 --> 01:05:14.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yes, Matthew 6:9, 10

01:05:14.925 --> 01:05:18.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s that valuable and important
for lasting peace.

01:05:18.762 --> 01:05:23.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom is the only road
to lasting peace.

01:05:23.058 --> 01:05:26.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in his role as King,

01:05:26.729 --> 01:05:31.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 19:15 describes Jesus

01:05:31.192 --> 01:05:35.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
as ‘striking the nations with an iron rod.’

01:05:35.154 --> 01:05:38.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, Jehovah will give
the command to his Son,

01:05:38.866 --> 01:05:43.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will destroy
all the things that disrupt peace.

01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gone will be the terror
that we have grown accustomed to living with

01:05:47.416 --> 01:05:49.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
day in and day out.

01:05:51.837 --> 01:05:54.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will happen next?

01:05:54.382 --> 01:05:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what will happen

01:05:56.759 --> 01:05:59.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 37:10, 11.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open our Bibles here
to Psalm 37:10, 11,

01:06:02.682 --> 01:06:05.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just allow this prophecy to absorb

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:07.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to thrill our minds and our hearts

01:06:07.395 --> 01:06:11.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give us a hope for the future.

01:06:12.525 --> 01:06:15.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10 of Psalm 37:

01:06:15.903 --> 01:06:18.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just a little while longer,

01:06:18.406 --> 01:06:23.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the wicked will be no more
[a little while longer];

01:06:23.244 --> 01:06:27.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will look at where they were,
and they will not be there.”

01:06:27.665 --> 01:06:29.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just a little while longer.”

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:31.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just like children saying
to their parents

01:06:31.294 --> 01:06:33.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
when going on a trip
“Are we there yet?”

01:06:33.338 --> 01:06:36.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the parents say
“Just a little while longer.”

01:06:36.591 --> 01:06:40.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings comfort to them,
and it’s the same with us.

01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:44.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
So imagine that!

01:06:44.223 --> 01:06:46.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means you go into the streets,

01:06:46.351 --> 01:06:48.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re looking for a wicked person,

01:06:48.353 --> 01:06:50.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will not be able to find even one.

01:06:50.688 --> 01:06:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wicked will be no more.”

01:06:54.317 --> 01:06:56.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth.”

01:06:56.903 --> 01:06:59.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we’re speaking about in verse 11.

01:06:59.072 --> 01:07:03.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that:
“But the meek will possess the earth,

01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:08.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will find exquisite delight
in the abundance of peace.”

01:07:09.249 --> 01:07:11.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love reading that.

01:07:11.668 --> 01:07:13.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Men will be at peace.

01:07:13.795 --> 01:07:17.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be at peace with themselves,
with their neighbors, with their God.

01:07:17.048 --> 01:07:18.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that sound to you?

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:20.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on that.

01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:24.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see yourself there
in a peaceful new world

01:07:24.639 --> 01:07:26.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the only news to tune into

01:07:26.641 --> 01:07:29.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
is regarding who’s getting resurrected today

01:07:29.394 --> 01:07:33.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
or which new person you will be assigned
to teach about Jehovah?

01:07:33.565 --> 01:07:36.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the joy
of studying with a person,

01:07:36.193 --> 01:07:38.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just from a different culture,

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
but from a different time period,

01:07:40.697 --> 01:07:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing things through their eyes

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:46.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they come to love Jehovah as you do?

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, soon the Prince of Peace

01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:54.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
will turn this world
into one of sheer delight

01:07:54.836 --> 01:07:58.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no more borders,
no more threats, no more worries—

01:07:58.131 --> 01:08:01.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
just an abundance of peace
with your brothers and sisters.

01:08:03.428 --> 01:08:05.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to be there?

01:08:05.889 --> 01:08:08.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:13.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we show our loyal support
for the Prince of Peace?

01:08:13.105 --> 01:08:15.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch the following video,

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:19.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice the different ways
we can do this right now.

01:08:23.574 --> 01:08:26.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am no part of the world.”

01:08:30.164 --> 01:08:34.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is the world a part of me?

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m pressured every day

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:43.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get involved in political issues
that affect me socially,

01:08:51.018 --> 01:08:54.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . environmentally,

01:09:00.027 --> 01:09:02.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and economically.

01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:14.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
That pressure could rob me
of my peace of mind

01:09:17.044 --> 01:09:19.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and influence how I think.

01:09:19.296 --> 01:09:21.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could take sides in my heart,

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:24.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if I’m not aware of it.

01:09:32.226 --> 01:09:35.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know that Jehovah

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:38.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
will care for all of mankind’s concerns

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . by means of his Kingdom

01:10:07.762 --> 01:10:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
ruled by his Son, Jesus Christ.

01:10:14.227 --> 01:10:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I show my support for him
in my prayers,

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:22.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . in how I think and feel,

01:10:32.036 --> 01:10:34.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and by teaching others

01:10:34.122 --> 01:10:36.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the Kingdom will do for mankind.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know there are millions

01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:43.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
of brothers and sisters
all over the world

01:10:43.089 --> 01:10:46.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . who loyally support
the “Prince of Peace”

01:10:46.217 --> 01:10:48.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like me, because I

01:10:49.888 --> 01:10:51.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I

01:10:52.766 --> 01:10:56.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I am no part of the world.

01:11:01.483 --> 01:11:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what takes away the peace
in the country where you live?

01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:08.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your community?
in your town? in your society?

01:11:08.448 --> 01:11:12.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most likely,
it’s the hot-button social issues.

01:11:12.828 --> 01:11:15.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
how our two brothers and sister

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed their loyal support
for the Prince of Peace?

01:11:18.417 --> 01:11:20.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
What issues affected them?

01:11:20.419 --> 01:11:25.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfair tax hikes, blatant injustice,
a disregard of the environment

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:30.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all things in themselves seemed
like noble causes worthy to get involved.

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:32.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can they get away with this?

01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:35.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not right.
We should do something.’

01:11:35.183 --> 01:11:37.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound familiar?

01:11:37.227 --> 01:11:40.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not have a literal sword in our hand,

01:11:40.564 --> 01:11:43.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we all have our Peterlike moments.

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:47.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re not careful,
issues that are close to our heart

01:11:47.279 --> 01:11:51.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
can charge our emotions
and we can lose our spiritual balance.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:55.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us
when we see things that are wrong?

01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:58.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what the Prince of Peace
said to Peter

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:00.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that highly charged moment:

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:05.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return your sword to its place.”

01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:08.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, this is not your fight.

01:12:08.467 --> 01:12:10.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do?

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:12.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do something far better than fight.

01:12:12.846 --> 01:12:14.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
We preach.

01:12:14.473 --> 01:12:17.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each time that we share the Kingdom news,

01:12:17.268 --> 01:12:20.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
we proclaim our support for Jesus’ rule.

01:12:20.938 --> 01:12:23.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the thing:

01:12:23.357 --> 01:12:26.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we truly believe
in the good news of the Kingdom,

01:12:26.986 --> 01:12:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not do anything
that hinders our ability to tell it.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once again, it’s so important

01:12:33.868 --> 01:12:37.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we truly believe
in the good news of the Kingdom,

01:12:37.913 --> 01:12:42.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not do anything
that hinders our ability to tell it.

01:12:42.918 --> 01:12:44.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:12:44.003 --> 01:12:45.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s find out.

01:12:45.296 --> 01:12:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open up to Peter’s words himself

01:12:47.423 --> 01:12:51.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 2:12

01:12:53.763 --> 01:12:56.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Peter 2:12.

01:12:56.891 --> 01:12:59.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter helps us here with why we need

01:12:59.352 --> 01:13:03.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain our conduct properly.

01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:05.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:12:

01:13:05.233 --> 01:13:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maintain your conduct fine
among the nations,

01:13:08.778 --> 01:13:11.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that when they accuse you
of being wrongdoers,

01:13:11.906 --> 01:13:14.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they may be eyewitnesses
of your fine works

01:13:14.784 --> 01:13:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as a result,
glorify God in the day of his inspection.”

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Peter had to learn this.

01:13:23.042 --> 01:13:25.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do we see the connection?

01:13:25.378 --> 01:13:29.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our actions and words
are directly linked to Jehovah.

01:13:29.424 --> 01:13:34.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
When people see us,
they see a people that worships Jehovah.

01:13:34.095 --> 01:13:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when people hear us,
they hear a people that worships Jehovah.

01:13:39.559 --> 01:13:43.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how our freeness of speech
to speak about God’s Kingdom

01:13:43.438 --> 01:13:48.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be hindered if we were to voice
a position for a political issue!

01:13:48.443 --> 01:13:50.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it can happen so easily.

01:13:50.695 --> 01:13:55.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can happen at work, at school,
with relatives, and so forth.

01:13:55.116 --> 01:13:57.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan sets the trap masterfully.

01:13:57.952 --> 01:13:59.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s just waiting.

01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he could only make us
“chop off the ear” of anything in this world

01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:07.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
that causes hurt and indignation in our heart

01:14:07.087 --> 01:14:11.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if he can hook our heartstrings
by getting us emotionally charged,

01:14:11.675 --> 01:14:15.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
he can then step back and reel us in.

01:14:15.345 --> 01:14:18.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new world, our hope for true peace,

01:14:18.265 --> 01:14:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
all starts to fade into the background.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give him that chance!

01:14:24.396 --> 01:14:26.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be determined to do

01:14:26.398 --> 01:14:30.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Titus 3:1, 2 tells us.

01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:33.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that

01:14:33.446 --> 01:14:37.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Titus chapter 3,

01:14:37.826 --> 01:14:39.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 1 and 2.

01:14:39.828 --> 01:14:42.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is the Scriptural admonition:

01:14:45.042 --> 01:14:48.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue reminding them to be in subjection

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to be obedient
to governments and authorities,

01:14:52.257 --> 01:14:54.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be ready for every good work,

01:14:54.676 --> 01:14:59.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to speak injuriously of no one,
not to be quarrelsome,

01:14:59.556 --> 01:15:03.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to be reasonable,
displaying all mildness toward all men.”

01:15:05.062 --> 01:15:07.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Be in subjection

01:15:07.105 --> 01:15:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be obedient
to governments and authorities.’

01:15:10.567 --> 01:15:12.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now let’s break that down.

01:15:12.236 --> 01:15:14.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
In practical terms, what does it mean?

01:15:14.696 --> 01:15:18.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means to obey the laws of the land
and pay taxes,

01:15:18.867 --> 01:15:22.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
to not speak negatively
about the superior authorities,

01:15:22.871 --> 01:15:25.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be careful not to take sides
on political issues

01:15:25.916 --> 01:15:28.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
(not even in our hearts).

01:15:28.377 --> 01:15:31.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
that expression from the video?

01:15:31.505 --> 01:15:33.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am no part of the world.

01:15:33.632 --> 01:15:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is the world a part of me?”

01:15:36.885 --> 01:15:38.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
when we find ourselves

01:15:38.887 --> 01:15:42.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Caesar’s law and God’s law,
we know what to do.

01:15:42.099 --> 01:15:46.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
We apply Acts 5:29
and “obey God as ruler rather than men.”

01:15:46.979 --> 01:15:48.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that.

01:15:48.981 --> 01:15:53.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Jesus, who healed the ear
of the armed guard Malchus,

01:15:53.235 --> 01:15:55.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re determined to react with mildness

01:15:55.654 --> 01:16:00.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
when provoked by an injustice
or cruelty in this world.

01:16:02.787 --> 01:16:04.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
In conclusion,

01:16:04.789 --> 01:16:09.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the indescribable privilege
to honor the Prince of Peace.

01:16:09.794 --> 01:16:14.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how reassuring it is to know
that Jesus understands our feelings!

01:16:14.799 --> 01:16:19.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
He understands our emotions
when we see things that we know are wrong.

01:16:19.804 --> 01:16:22.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows these things hurt our heart.

01:16:22.932 --> 01:16:24.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just want to make things right.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember the critical lesson

01:16:28.563 --> 01:16:32.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
he taught his apostles
in the garden of Gethsemane:

01:16:32.358 --> 01:16:35.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not your fight.

01:16:38.489 --> 01:16:43.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, Jehovah, the King of Eternity,
and Jesus, the Prince of Peace,

01:16:43.119 --> 01:16:47.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
are telling us:
“This is our fight. Leave it in our hands.”

01:16:47.957 --> 01:16:51.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, the prophecy at Isaiah 9:6, 7

01:16:51.919 --> 01:16:54.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be fulfilled completely.

01:16:54.589 --> 01:16:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
keep preaching about the Kingdom.

01:16:57.925 --> 01:16:59.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Avoid saying or doing anything

01:16:59.927 --> 01:17:03.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
that suggests taking sides
on a political issue.

01:17:03.723 --> 01:17:06.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t allow yourself to “chop off the ear”

01:17:06.184 --> 01:17:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the injustices and the causes of conflict
of this old world.

01:17:10.271 --> 01:17:13.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter tried that, but it didn’t work.

01:17:13.691 --> 01:17:16.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned a big lesson
that day in the garden,

01:17:16.694 --> 01:17:18.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he never forgot it.

01:17:18.696 --> 01:17:21.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never forget it either.

01:17:21.157 --> 01:17:24.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to show
your active and loyal support

01:17:24.702 --> 01:17:26.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Prince of Peace

01:17:26.746 --> 01:17:31.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we echo Peter’s words at 2 Peter 3:14

01:17:31.751 --> 01:17:36.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “do [our] utmost to be found finally
by [Jehovah and the Prince of Peace]

01:17:36.673 --> 01:17:40.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
spotless and unblemished and in peace.”

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:45.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Noumair,
for strengthening our determination

01:17:45.849 --> 01:17:47.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give our undivided support

01:17:47.851 --> 01:17:51.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s appointed King, Christ Jesus.

01:17:52.522 --> 01:17:55.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
This brings us
to the final talk of today’s session.

01:17:57.235 --> 01:18:01.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus promised to give his followers peace.

01:18:01.656 --> 01:18:05.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the peace that Jesus gives
far superior

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:09.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
to any peace that this world promises?

01:18:09.247 --> 01:18:12.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can we safeguard the gift of peace

01:18:12.793 --> 01:18:14.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus has given us?

01:18:16.546 --> 01:18:20.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along
as Brother Anthony Morris,

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:22.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

01:18:22.052 --> 01:18:26.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
delivers the talk,
“Do Not Be Misled by Imitation Peace!”

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus taught us that Satan

01:18:37.943 --> 01:18:40.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the father of the lie.”

01:18:41.822 --> 01:18:45.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recall that he deceived Eve,
a perfect woman.

01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:50.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lied about our precious Jehovah.

01:18:50.998 --> 01:18:55.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you’re familiar (many of you)
with Revelation chapter 12.

01:18:55.294 --> 01:18:57.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to find that

01:18:57.504 --> 01:19:00.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 12.

01:19:00.549 --> 01:19:04.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this chapter, verses 7 and 8,

01:19:04.386 --> 01:19:07.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
it addressed the fact
that “war broke out in heaven.”

01:19:07.806 --> 01:19:09.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice

01:19:09.808 --> 01:19:13.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
that after he’s kicked out of heaven,

01:19:13.479 --> 01:19:15.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 9 we read:

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:18.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So down the great dragon was hurled,

01:19:18.943 --> 01:19:23.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the original serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan,

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth;

01:19:27.535 --> 01:19:30.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was hurled down to the earth,
and his angels

01:19:30.955 --> 01:19:33.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
were hurled down with him.”

01:19:33.874 --> 01:19:38.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I read it that way specifically,

01:19:38.879 --> 01:19:42.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what it doesn’t say is

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:44.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in the middle part of verse 9):

01:19:44.844 --> 01:19:49.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Satan, who is [trying to mislead]

01:19:49.098 --> 01:19:51.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire inhabited earth.”

01:19:51.976 --> 01:19:56.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he <i>“is</i>  misleading

01:19:56.355 --> 01:19:59.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire inhabited earth.”

01:19:59.734 --> 01:20:04.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s crucial to understand
when we think about the theme of this talk,

01:20:04.572 --> 01:20:08.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be misled by imitation peace,

01:20:08.201 --> 01:20:10.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
because as “the ruler of the world,”

01:20:10.953 --> 01:20:14.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s what he’s out to do—mislead.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:19.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it’s an interesting point
here in 2 Corinthians chapter 11

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appreciate

01:20:22.799 --> 01:20:27.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he goes about misleading,
or at least it’s addressed here

01:20:27.178 --> 01:20:31.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as a good warning for us.

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:35.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
And an interesting point with the revision

01:20:35.728 --> 01:20:38.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

01:20:38.273 --> 01:20:42.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
(for those of you in the truth before 2013

01:20:42.402 --> 01:20:45.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it was revised, you’ll remember this)

01:20:45.655 --> 01:20:49.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 14 of 2 Corinthians chapter 11:

01:20:49.868 --> 01:20:54.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And no wonder,
for Satan himself keeps disguising himself

01:20:54.706 --> 01:20:57.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an angel of light.”

01:20:57.167 --> 01:21:01.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>New World Translation</i>

01:21:01.129 --> 01:21:03.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to say before the revision

01:21:03.882 --> 01:21:08.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[transforms] himself
into an angel of light.”

01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:13.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the very English word “metamorphosis,”

01:21:13.058 --> 01:21:18.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
like for a caterpillar transforming
into a beautiful butterfly,

01:21:18.063 --> 01:21:21.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s where it comes from,
the Greek language.

01:21:21.316 --> 01:21:26.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that word was not in verse 14.

01:21:26.321 --> 01:21:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, because Satan can’t transform himself

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
into “an angel of light”
(so it’s an improved translation),

01:21:34.746 --> 01:21:37.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he does disguise.

01:21:37.249 --> 01:21:39.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a masquerader.

01:21:39.668 --> 01:21:44.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he does that with the subject of peace.

01:21:44.673 --> 01:21:48.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
His world offers a sort of peace,

01:21:48.927 --> 01:21:52.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s imitation peace.

01:21:52.681 --> 01:21:57.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus is distinguished,
though, with the peace that he gives.

01:21:57.019 --> 01:21:59.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’ll follow along here

01:21:59.229 --> 01:22:02.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
in John chapter 14,

01:22:03.775 --> 01:22:06.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
he himself explains it to us.

01:22:06.111 --> 01:22:09.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we treasure the Gospel accounts,

01:22:09.573 --> 01:22:13.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 27: “I leave you peace;

01:22:13.952 --> 01:22:16.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I give you my peace.

01:22:16.705 --> 01:22:20.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I do not give it to you
the way the world gives it.

01:22:20.459 --> 01:22:25.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not let your hearts be troubled
nor let them shrink out of fear.”

01:22:25.464 --> 01:22:30.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus gives us his peace, see.

01:22:30.094 --> 01:22:32.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace that Jesus gives us,

01:22:32.721 --> 01:22:37.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s this inner calm once you know
the truth and Jesus gives us the peace.

01:22:37.726 --> 01:22:42.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have this confidence that he loves us
and Jehovah loves us,

01:22:42.731 --> 01:22:47.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we enjoy a good,
peaceful relationship with them

01:22:47.444 --> 01:22:49.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a good conscience.

01:22:49.572 --> 01:22:54.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we look forward to the Kingdom
removing all war and death.

01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:58.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a point to make here:

01:22:58.414 --> 01:23:01.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan wants us to trade

01:23:01.542 --> 01:23:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace that Jesus gives

01:23:03.919 --> 01:23:07.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his imitation peace

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:11.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he has advertised in the world.

01:23:11.427 --> 01:23:13.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in this talk,

01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:18.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will consider
three forms of imitation peace

01:23:18.976 --> 01:23:23.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why the peace
that Jesus gives is superior.

01:23:25.483 --> 01:23:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one has to do with material things

01:23:29.612 --> 01:23:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how they’ll not bring true peace.

01:23:32.615 --> 01:23:37.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to help us with that,
turn to Matthew chapter 4,

01:23:38.121 --> 01:23:42.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll be referring to this chapter

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:47.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout this particular talk
about not being misled by imitation peace.

01:23:47.547 --> 01:23:50.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this one
is connected with material things

01:23:50.049 --> 01:23:52.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how they don’t bring true peace—

01:23:52.051 --> 01:23:54.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the example Jesus sets forth here.

01:23:54.595 --> 01:23:57.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Matthew chapter 4:

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus was led by the spirit

01:23:59.851 --> 01:24:03.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“up into the wilderness
to be tempted by the Devil.

01:24:03.646 --> 01:24:07.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After he had fasted
for 40 days and 40 nights,

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:09.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he felt hungry.

01:24:09.152 --> 01:24:12.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the Tempter approached and said to him:

01:24:12.238 --> 01:24:14.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you are a son of God,

01:24:14.699 --> 01:24:17.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:22.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he answered: ‘It is written:

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Man must live, not on bread alone,

01:24:25.877 --> 01:24:30.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on every word that comes
from Jehovah’s mouth.”’”

01:24:30.507 --> 01:24:33.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful rebuttal?

01:24:33.093 --> 01:24:36.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus refused to trade

01:24:36.012 --> 01:24:40.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
his peace for material things
(in this case, bread),

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:43.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though he was hungry.

01:24:43.103 --> 01:24:47.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
So serving Jehovah was more important to him

01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:49.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
than material things, see.

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:53.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world, they have this thinking,

01:24:53.113 --> 01:24:55.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, you need

01:24:55.615 --> 01:24:59.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
a certain amount of money to retire,’

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:04.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re constantly
focused on material things

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:07.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not Jesus, see.

01:25:07.044 --> 01:25:11.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s superior peace from Jehovah God.

01:25:11.715 --> 01:25:14.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s only temporary anyway,

01:25:14.551 --> 01:25:17.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
the material benefits that people seek

01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:21.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pursue throughout their lives.

01:25:21.141 --> 01:25:24.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we can enjoy true contentment

01:25:24.645 --> 01:25:28.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah God is going to care for us.

01:25:28.732 --> 01:25:33.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many have
personal experiences to prove that.

01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:36.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,

01:25:36.281 --> 01:25:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
see what a brother learned
about the so-called peace

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the world promises.

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:52.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a family, we were doing
very well spiritually.

01:25:52.297 --> 01:25:55.175 line:10% position:50% align:center
We did family worship, went preaching,

01:25:55.175 --> 01:25:58.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
and went to the meetings together.

01:25:59.221 --> 01:26:01.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some time, we began

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encounter financial problems.

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:07.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we did not even have money
to buy food

01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:09.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each day.

01:26:11.567 --> 01:26:14.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in our area
were going to South Africa

01:26:14.111 --> 01:26:16.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide basic needs for their families.

01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:19.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to go as well,

01:26:20.367 --> 01:26:24.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving behind my wife
to take care of our seven children.

01:26:33.964 --> 01:26:35.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
This affected me spiritually

01:26:35.967 --> 01:26:39.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I did not know the language,
I was unable to preach,

01:26:39.804 --> 01:26:42.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

01:26:43.307 --> 01:26:45.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being so far from my family

01:26:45.393 --> 01:26:49.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused me to neglect
my responsibility as a family head.

01:26:50.147 --> 01:26:54.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually

01:26:54.527 --> 01:26:57.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we all missed each other very much.

01:26:57.071 --> 01:27:01.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I had made
a wrong decision going abroad.

01:27:01.033 --> 01:27:04.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

01:27:04.787 --> 01:27:07.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I remembered the example of Baruch

01:27:07.123 --> 01:27:10.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Jeremiah 45:5.

01:27:12.837 --> 01:27:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch may have wanted
to pursue material riches as I had.

01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:20.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was helped, he returned.

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:25.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:28.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of searching for material things.

01:27:28.978 --> 01:27:32.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started to make changes to go home

01:27:32.106 --> 01:27:34.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help my family spiritually.

01:27:36.444 --> 01:27:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I left South Africa
and reached the border of Malawi

01:27:39.948 --> 01:27:43.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
(after leaving my family
for about six months),

01:27:43.284 --> 01:27:46.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt great happiness in my heart,

01:27:46.621 --> 01:27:49.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am still happy till now.

01:27:50.166 --> 01:27:53.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying the Bible has helped me.

01:27:53.002 --> 01:27:55.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still encounter financial problems,

01:27:56.548 --> 01:27:58.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I remember that in Satan’s world,

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:01.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is nowhere we can go
and have no problems.

01:28:02.387 --> 01:28:04.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I serve as an elder.

01:28:05.557 --> 01:28:07.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family is progressing spiritually.

01:28:09.728 --> 01:28:11.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this makes me very happy,

01:28:11.897 --> 01:28:15.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my relationship
with Jehovah is strong.

01:28:22.073 --> 01:28:26.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he learned a hard lesson.

01:28:26.411 --> 01:28:28.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
He goes to South Africa

01:28:28.705 --> 01:28:33.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
—meetings interrupted and no field service.

01:28:33.126 --> 01:28:36.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he remembers Baruch,

01:28:36.088 --> 01:28:38.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
secretary for Jeremiah.

01:28:38.965 --> 01:28:43.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he returns to be with his family,
putting the Kingdom first,

01:28:43.845 --> 01:28:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we appreciate him
being truthful and sharing that experience.

01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:53.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s imitation peace,
going after material things.

01:28:54.273 --> 01:28:58.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now this next one, it’s quite interesting.

01:28:58.527 --> 01:29:00.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
So pay close attention

01:29:00.529 --> 01:29:05.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there may be some
listening who need this counsel.

01:29:05.075 --> 01:29:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan’s world says that we

01:29:07.995 --> 01:29:10.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
can ignore Bible standards

01:29:10.289 --> 01:29:15.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we might need
to ignore some of them to gain peace of mind.

01:29:15.294 --> 01:29:19.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are two examples
that we’re going to analyze in this talk.

01:29:19.965 --> 01:29:23.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person may reason
that marrying an unbeliever

01:29:24.845 --> 01:29:29.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
or obtaining an unscriptural divorce

01:29:29.016 --> 01:29:31.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make life easier.

01:29:31.852 --> 01:29:35.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they start reasoning this way,

01:29:35.272 --> 01:29:38.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I just want to get married,

01:29:38.484 --> 01:29:41.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s an unbeliever,
but he’s a nice person.’

01:29:41.612 --> 01:29:45.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things like that go on
with the treacherous heart.

01:29:45.616 --> 01:29:50.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we go to the example
of our Lord and Master, Jesus.

01:29:50.454 --> 01:29:55.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to read verses 5-7 of Matthew 4:

01:29:56.836 --> 01:30:00.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the Devil took him
along into the holy city,

01:30:00.715 --> 01:30:04.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he stationed him
on the battlement of the temple

01:30:04.135 --> 01:30:06.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to him:

01:30:06.262 --> 01:30:10.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you are a son of God,
throw yourself down,

01:30:10.266 --> 01:30:12.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for it is written:

01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:15.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“He will give his angels
a command concerning you,” 

01:30:15.688 --> 01:30:18.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and, “They will carry you on their hands,

01:30:18.441 --> 01:30:23.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may not strike
your foot against a stone.”’

01:30:23.029 --> 01:30:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to him: ‘Again, it is written:

01:30:27.366 --> 01:30:31.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not put Jehovah
your God to the test.”’”

01:30:33.122 --> 01:30:36.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus made that very clear.

01:30:36.793 --> 01:30:39.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was going to be obedient to his Father

01:30:39.504 --> 01:30:43.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wasn’t going to worry about being testy

01:30:43.883 --> 01:30:48.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
with such an experience
as the Devil proposed there.

01:30:48.763 --> 01:30:53.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obedience

01:30:53.351 --> 01:30:57.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jesus twice (in a moment we’ll read
another one) said: “It is written.”

01:30:57.981 --> 01:31:01.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sticks with the Scriptures
—Jehovah’s thinking—

01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:05.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he refused to disobey Jehovah.

01:31:05.989 --> 01:31:09.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now here’s the question,

01:31:09.075 --> 01:31:12.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the peace that Jesus gives

01:31:12.328 --> 01:31:14.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
superior to the pursuit

01:31:14.831 --> 01:31:19.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

01:31:20.587 --> 01:31:22.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let that sink in.

01:31:22.630 --> 01:31:25.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the peace that Jesus gives

01:31:25.342 --> 01:31:27.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
superior to the pursuit

01:31:27.594 --> 01:31:30.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

01:31:30.639 --> 01:31:33.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, marrying an unbeliever

01:31:34.809 --> 01:31:38.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that will likely bring
(and it has happened time after time)

01:31:38.897 --> 01:31:41.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
that person greater pain

01:31:43.068 --> 01:31:46.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the longing
they felt when they were single.

01:31:46.279 --> 01:31:48.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve personally seen that

01:31:48.281 --> 01:31:52.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
all too many times in various congregations

01:31:52.285 --> 01:31:55.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve had the privilege to serve in.

01:31:55.539 --> 01:32:00.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the other one
is an unscriptural divorce.

01:32:00.585 --> 01:32:03.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
It often leads to immoral conduct.

01:32:03.797 --> 01:32:07.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly leads to a troubled conscience,

01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:11.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional damage
and, of course, a loss of privileges.

01:32:13.307 --> 01:32:16.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is very important to keep in mind.

01:32:17.519 --> 01:32:22.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that with two imperfect individuals

01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:26.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
married to each other,
well, there are going to be difficulties

01:32:26.195 --> 01:32:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are going to be challenges.

01:32:29.198 --> 01:32:32.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
But stop and think about this:

01:32:32.785 --> 01:32:35.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re having difficulties,

01:32:35.245 --> 01:32:38.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t forget that marriage

01:32:38.207 --> 01:32:40.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a sacred arrangement.

01:32:41.752 --> 01:32:45.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world totally has forgotten that.

01:32:45.589 --> 01:32:49.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah will strengthen

01:32:49.802 --> 01:32:53.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
both to make a success.

01:32:53.681 --> 01:32:58.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to keep that in mind:
Jehovah will strengthen and help

01:32:58.143 --> 01:33:02.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can succeed
because this is his sacred arrangement.

01:33:02.439 --> 01:33:06.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Devil has been attacking
the family arrangement

01:33:06.151 --> 01:33:09.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
all through the last days of this system,

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:11.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s intensifying it

01:33:11.866 --> 01:33:15.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he gets closer
to being thrown into the abyss.

01:33:16.996 --> 01:33:19.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,

01:33:19.582 --> 01:33:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the results
of pursuing imitation peace.

01:33:26.922 --> 01:33:28.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
Newly married life came with a lot

01:33:28.966 --> 01:33:31.260 line:10% position:50% align:center
of unexpected challenges.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
You dream about the way
your marriage will go,

01:33:34.639 --> 01:33:37.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then the reality is quite different.

01:33:40.228 --> 01:33:42.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
All we ever did was argue,

01:33:42.313 --> 01:33:44.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we wouldn’t speak to one another.

01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never ever went to the elders.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:49.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t want to bother them.

01:33:49.403 --> 01:33:52.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just felt, you know,
we needed to figure it out ourselves.

01:33:55.535 --> 01:33:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided that if the house sold,

01:33:57.745 --> 01:33:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we would separate.

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
The separation wasn’t a good thing,

01:34:07.422 --> 01:34:10.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in some respects
it made things worse.

01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:13.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
It did have an impact on the boys.

01:34:14.262 --> 01:34:15.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
They started acting out.

01:34:15.346 --> 01:34:19.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got into some trouble
with the police one time.

01:34:21.269 --> 01:34:25.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was a loneliness
because you’ve gotten married,

01:34:25.315 --> 01:34:28.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you don’t have that,
and you’re by yourself.

01:34:28.318 --> 01:34:31.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same old routine
went on where you’re

01:34:31.279 --> 01:34:34.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
cooking and cleaning
and doing laundry and working.

01:34:36.367 --> 01:34:38.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt sick to my stomach.

01:34:38.286 --> 01:34:42.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a hard time getting up every morning
and facing the world.

01:34:42.457 --> 01:34:44.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point, I felt that I needed

01:34:44.834 --> 01:34:47.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have the elders help out a little bit.

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:51.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did pray for Jehovah’s help to direct me,

01:34:51.508 --> 01:34:54.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I kept wondering
why Jehovah wasn’t really

01:34:54.886 --> 01:34:56.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
answering my prayers.

01:34:56.096 --> 01:35:01.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I kind of realize now
that it was because we were separated.

01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:05.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expectations of the separation
were not at all what I was thinking.

01:35:06.565 --> 01:35:08.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
I reflected on the marriage vows.

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the things I thought about

01:35:11.069 --> 01:35:14.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a sister in our congregation.

01:35:14.406 --> 01:35:17.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was married to an unbeliever,
and then she learned the truth.

01:35:17.868 --> 01:35:20.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was so violent.

01:35:20.162 --> 01:35:24.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would beat her; he would burn her books;
he would burn her clothes.

01:35:24.791 --> 01:35:27.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not allow her children
to attend the meetings.

01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:30.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought about the problems
that Darrel and I had.

01:35:30.589 --> 01:35:32.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:
‘Well, Darrel is a kind person.

01:35:32.799 --> 01:35:34.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s never done that.’

01:35:34.051 --> 01:35:35.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:

01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:37.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, this is something

01:35:37.095 --> 01:35:38.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that we need to really work on.

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:41.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We need to really put forth the effort

01:35:41.975 --> 01:35:44.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to start applying Bible principles

01:35:44.645 --> 01:35:46.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to put Jehovah first in our life

01:35:46.605 --> 01:35:50.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can bring our marriage
back in union with Jehovah.’

01:35:51.485 --> 01:35:55.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted,

01:35:55.113 --> 01:35:57.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was what Jehovah wanted.

01:36:00.744 --> 01:36:02.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was just no other choice.

01:36:02.955 --> 01:36:06.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wasn’t going to bless us
unless we got back together.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:12.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got back together,
our marriage was still a work in progress.

01:36:12.589 --> 01:36:14.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t have
a perfect marriage in this world,

01:36:14.591 --> 01:36:18.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you can sure make it better
when you put Jehovah first.

01:36:18.345 --> 01:36:20.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoyed the feelings
we had toward each other.

01:36:20.681 --> 01:36:22.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt closer to Debbie.

01:36:25.436 --> 01:36:27.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Debbie and I
have been married now for 48 years.

01:36:27.688 --> 01:36:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Separation does not make
anything better at all.

01:36:31.901 --> 01:36:35.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you even have an inkling of love
for one another,

01:36:35.112 --> 01:36:38.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
you want to work on that,
and you want to make it bloom

01:36:38.616 --> 01:36:40.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jehovah can bless it.

01:36:40.618 --> 01:36:42.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings have been endless.

01:36:42.661 --> 01:36:44.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our children are all doing

01:36:44.663 --> 01:36:47.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
fantastic in the truth.

01:36:47.291 --> 01:36:49.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said:
“Taste and see that [He] is good.”

01:36:49.585 --> 01:36:51.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ve got to do that.

01:36:57.635 --> 01:37:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really appreciated this couple sharing

01:37:01.764 --> 01:37:05.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
their experience with the brotherhood.

01:37:05.142 --> 01:37:07.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned, you know.

01:37:07.562 --> 01:37:09.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were always arguing,

01:37:09.564 --> 01:37:13.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s all they
did was argue, argue, argue.

01:37:13.276 --> 01:37:16.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
It affected their children.

01:37:16.112 --> 01:37:20.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
They decided to separate
and finally have peace.

01:37:20.741 --> 01:37:24.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t have to be around her,’
or ‘I don’t have to be around him.’

01:37:24.996 --> 01:37:28.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he realized
his relationship with Jehovah

01:37:28.958 --> 01:37:31.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being interfered with here,

01:37:31.753 --> 01:37:34.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he went to the elders.

01:37:34.672 --> 01:37:36.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
His prayers were affected.

01:37:36.674 --> 01:37:39.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things he noticed
—he was honest about that.

01:37:39.427 --> 01:37:44.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our precious sister
was so nice to honestly explain.

01:37:44.182 --> 01:37:48.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said what she learned
was that ‘this is not about me;

01:37:48.728 --> 01:37:51.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s about Jehovah.’

01:37:51.147 --> 01:37:54.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you finally come to that realization,

01:37:54.484 --> 01:37:56.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will strengthen you

01:37:56.694 --> 01:38:00.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy peace with your marriage partner.

01:38:01.783 --> 01:38:06.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the next one, I never tire of speaking

01:38:06.287 --> 01:38:11.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
about these particular couple of verses

01:38:11.292 --> 01:38:15.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
or reading about it or hearing
another brother give a talk about it.

01:38:15.964 --> 01:38:18.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, here’s what’s coming soon.

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:22.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.

01:38:22.178 --> 01:38:25.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many of you are going, ‘Oh, yeah, I know

01:38:25.932 --> 01:38:28.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he’s going to read about.’

01:38:28.351 --> 01:38:32.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is one of the prophecies

01:38:32.564 --> 01:38:35.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is yet to be fulfilled.

01:38:35.817 --> 01:38:38.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s just invigorating

01:38:38.153 --> 01:38:41.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know that soon
here’s what’s going to happen

01:38:41.573 --> 01:38:44.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

01:38:45.827 --> 01:38:48.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 2 and 3:

01:38:48.038 --> 01:38:52.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For you yourselves know very well

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah’s day
is coming exactly as a thief in the night.

01:38:58.256 --> 01:39:00.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:04.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

01:39:04.304 --> 01:39:09.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

01:39:09.184 --> 01:39:13.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

01:39:13.146 --> 01:39:17.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

01:39:18.694 --> 01:39:21.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, see, “Jehovah’s day”

01:39:21.738 --> 01:39:26.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this has to do with the day
of the outbreak of the great tribulation

01:39:26.368 --> 01:39:29.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Babylon the Great is destroyed

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Armageddon finishes it off.

01:39:31.915 --> 01:39:35.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this context, that’s “Jehovah’s day.”

01:39:35.127 --> 01:39:38.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happens before then

01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:42.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
is this proclamation, “peace and security!”

01:39:42.551 --> 01:39:45.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will religious leaders be involved?

01:39:45.262 --> 01:39:49.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they’re part of Satan’s system;
that’s very possible.

01:39:49.099 --> 01:39:50.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll have to wait and see.

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:54.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will it be one announcement
or a series of announcements?

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:56.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
That we don’t know.

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is coming.

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:02.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those who are staying close to Jehovah

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:06.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoying the peace
from him and his Son, Jesus,

01:40:06.283 --> 01:40:08.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be deceived

01:40:08.786 --> 01:40:12.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
by this imitation proclamation of peace

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:15.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
—imitation peace.

01:40:15.418 --> 01:40:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, back in Matthew chapter 4,

01:40:20.089 --> 01:40:23.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to see how Jesus handled

01:40:23.801 --> 01:40:26.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
this type of test from the Devil

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:28.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what we learn from it here

01:40:28.931 --> 01:40:33.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 8-11 of Matthew chapter 4.

01:40:35.104 --> 01:40:38.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Again the Devil took him [in verse 8]

01:40:38.024 --> 01:40:41.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along to an unusually high mountain

01:40:41.486 --> 01:40:46.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and showed him all the kingdoms
of the world and their glory.

01:40:46.032 --> 01:40:48.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he said to him:

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘All these things I will give you

01:40:51.454 --> 01:40:55.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if you fall down
and do an act of worship to me.’

01:40:57.001 --> 01:41:00.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus said to him [without hesitation]:

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:02.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go away, Satan!

01:41:02.882 --> 01:41:07.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For it is written:
“It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

01:41:07.512 --> 01:41:12.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”’

01:41:13.101 --> 01:41:17.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the Devil left him,
and look! angels came

01:41:17.105 --> 01:41:19.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began to minister to him.”

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:24.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away, a third time: “It is written.”

01:41:24.487 --> 01:41:27.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was having nothing to do

01:41:27.866 --> 01:41:32.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this offer of the kingdoms
—this imitation peace.

01:41:32.036 --> 01:41:35.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’ll have all the glory and rule.’

01:41:35.999 --> 01:41:39.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s always boggled my mind

01:41:39.210 --> 01:41:42.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this one who knew

01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:45.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus in his prehuman existence

01:41:45.634 --> 01:41:50.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have the audacity to try to get Jesus
to bow down and worship him.

01:41:50.597 --> 01:41:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows you that he’s obviously insane.

01:41:57.020 --> 01:42:00.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he wouldn’t allow it either

01:42:00.065 --> 01:42:02.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they tried to make him an earthly king.

01:42:02.484 --> 01:42:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus wasn’t having any part of that.

01:42:05.028 --> 01:42:08.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were thinking he could bring them peace.

01:42:08.281 --> 01:42:13.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus said there’s no peace
except by Jehovah’s way.

01:42:14.162 --> 01:42:18.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace from God’s Kingdom
is so superior

01:42:18.583 --> 01:42:23.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anything they could try to come up with
—their imitation peace.

01:42:24.297 --> 01:42:25.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s why.

01:42:25.424 --> 01:42:27.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about this:

01:42:28.969 --> 01:42:31.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will remove the Devil.

01:42:33.056 --> 01:42:36.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will remove human rulership.

01:42:36.768 --> 01:42:39.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will remove sin.

01:42:40.439 --> 01:42:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the earth’s peace
will never again be disturbed.

01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:51.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I appreciate very much
that he’s going to get rid of all problems,

01:42:51.825 --> 01:42:56.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that includes undoing all causes of pain

01:42:56.288 --> 01:42:59.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and not just physical pain,

01:42:59.333 --> 01:43:02.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional pain as well.

01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:08.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful to look forward to that time

01:43:08.008 --> 01:43:10.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that beautiful peace

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:13.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our precious Father,
Jehovah, and his Son, Jesus.

01:43:13.722 --> 01:43:16.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,

01:43:16.809 --> 01:43:19.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
see what convinced this sister

01:43:19.144 --> 01:43:24.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to believe the world’s promises of peace.

01:43:28.529 --> 01:43:31.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father always taught me
that we needed God in our life

01:43:31.574 --> 01:43:33.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for there to be peace.

01:43:36.328 --> 01:43:38.414 line:10% position:50% align:center
And he always wanted to know,

01:43:38.414 --> 01:43:40.458 line:10% position:50% align:center
Can Christians go to war?

01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:45.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is this consistent
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

01:43:46.464 --> 01:43:49.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the pastor could never give us an answer,

01:43:49.967 --> 01:43:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so I thought I’d have to look
to politics to find it.

01:43:53.429 --> 01:43:56.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of peace movements
were being formed at that time,

01:43:56.891 --> 01:43:58.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I joined one of them.

01:44:00.728 --> 01:44:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided where
the protest marches would be

01:44:03.606 --> 01:44:05.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and which pamphlets we would use.

01:44:09.278 --> 01:44:11.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the protests were over,

01:44:11.864 --> 01:44:14.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone was so excited

01:44:14.242 --> 01:44:16.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they all started applauding

01:44:16.536 --> 01:44:18.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cheering for the leaders.

01:44:18.579 --> 01:44:22.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought:
‘That’s not what I wanted.

01:44:22.041 --> 01:44:24.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t want to honor people.

01:44:24.335 --> 01:44:27.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I want to have world peace.

01:44:27.547 --> 01:44:29.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that still hasn’t happened yet.’

01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I started to feel very alone,

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it made me feel unsafe in this world.

01:44:40.643 --> 01:44:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
With no peace in sight,

01:44:42.645 --> 01:44:45.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘What is the purpose of life?’

01:44:46.691 --> 01:44:50.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
While visiting friends for coffee,
I saw a man I’d never met before.

01:44:52.489 --> 01:44:55.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
My friends told me he wanted
to talk to us about the Bible.

01:44:58.912 --> 01:45:00.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I asked him:

01:45:00.705 --> 01:45:02.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sir, what do you think?

01:45:02.665 --> 01:45:04.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can Christians join the military?”

01:45:05.752 --> 01:45:08.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the man said,
“No, that’s not allowed

01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:11.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Bible says
you should ‘love your [enemy].’”

01:45:14.135 --> 01:45:16.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me think
about what my father always said

01:45:17.389 --> 01:45:19.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that we need God to bring peace.

01:45:23.478 --> 01:45:25.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a really nice lady came to my door,

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she had an orange book in her hand.

01:45:28.942 --> 01:45:31.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it said:
<i>True Peace and Security.</i>

01:45:35.699 --> 01:45:37.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reading it, I thought:

01:45:37.826 --> 01:45:39.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This is it!

01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:43.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the organization
that truly wants peace.’

01:45:45.959 --> 01:45:49.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I went to those involved
in the peace movement.

01:45:50.505 --> 01:45:53.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told them that I believe
that God will change this world

01:45:53.508 --> 01:45:56.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a beautiful earth
where there’ll be true peace.

01:45:58.347 --> 01:46:01.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all looked at me
like I had lost my mind.

01:46:02.017 --> 01:46:04.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy with my new life.

01:46:04.686 --> 01:46:06.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like I was part of a family

01:46:06.521 --> 01:46:08.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
who truly cared about one another

01:46:08.565 --> 01:46:11.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really wanted peace with each other.

01:46:15.447 --> 01:46:19.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 14:7 had a major impact on my life

01:46:19.618 --> 01:46:21.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there God promises

01:46:21.829 --> 01:46:24.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
a calm and peaceful world.

01:46:33.882 --> 01:46:37.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that nice how she learned?

01:46:37.428 --> 01:46:42.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’d looked to politics and protests
for world peace.

01:46:42.016 --> 01:46:44.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, she was sincere.

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she learned that’s all imitation peace.

01:46:49.398 --> 01:46:54.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
True peace and security
comes from Jehovah God.

01:46:55.529 --> 01:47:00.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
So wrapping it up with these
three different types

01:47:00.201 --> 01:47:03.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
of imitation peace
that we’ve emphasized,

01:47:03.829 --> 01:47:08.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to encourage you
in these last minutes

01:47:08.501 --> 01:47:13.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
to safeguard the peace
that Jesus has given you.

01:47:15.299 --> 01:47:17.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
In John chapter 14

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
(you know this,
but I want you to really focus

01:47:23.933 --> 01:47:28.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a particular point), in verse 6:

01:47:30.022 --> 01:47:32.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to him:

01:47:32.024 --> 01:47:36.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am the way and the truth and the life.

01:47:36.612 --> 01:47:41.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one comes to the Father
except through me.’”

01:47:41.617 --> 01:47:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

01:47:44.912 --> 01:47:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Particularly we want to emphasize
Jesus is “the truth.”

01:47:51.836 --> 01:47:54.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust all of his promises.

01:47:54.172 --> 01:47:56.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is “the truth.”

01:47:57.884 --> 01:48:00.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to give us peace
—already has—

01:48:00.928 --> 01:48:05.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will to a greater extent in the future.

01:48:05.099 --> 01:48:08.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our Master is “the truth.”

01:48:08.561 --> 01:48:12.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he gave the early Christians that peace.

01:48:12.357 --> 01:48:15.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things that they were able to deal
with are just mind-boggling.

01:48:15.652 --> 01:48:20.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the apostle Paul’s experiences
and Peter’s and others’

01:48:20.657 --> 01:48:24.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the persecution they endured—
they did it,

01:48:24.244 --> 01:48:27.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
enduring with joy.

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing!

01:48:28.498 --> 01:48:33.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can only be
a supernatural provision of peace.

01:48:33.503 --> 01:48:35.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just remember,

01:48:35.755 --> 01:48:40.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will likewise give you
the peace you need now

01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:45.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep doing Jehovah’s will
and to make Him happy.

01:48:45.515 --> 01:48:48.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, brothers, please,

01:48:49.895 --> 01:48:53.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
safeguard the gift of peace

01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:56.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus has given you.

01:48:56.401 --> 01:48:59.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan uses this world

01:48:59.488 --> 01:49:03.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer you promises of imitation peace.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be misled!

01:49:06.995 --> 01:49:11.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, rather, “Let the peace of the Christ
rule in your hearts.”

01:49:11.583 --> 01:49:14.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And show yourselves thankful.”

01:49:14.002 --> 01:49:16.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, through his Son,

01:49:16.004 --> 01:49:20.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will bless us all with peace forever!

01:49:22.636 --> 01:49:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Morris,
for strengthening our trust in Jesus’ promise

01:49:26.556 --> 01:49:31.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give us peace now and during the events
that will shortly take place.

01:49:32.938 --> 01:49:36.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second session of our convention
has truly helped us 

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how Jehovah blesses us with peace.

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:45.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we look forward to
in the next session?

01:49:45.325 --> 01:49:49.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture theme will be
from 2 Peter 3:14:

01:49:49.955 --> 01:49:54.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be found . . . spotless and unblemished
and in peace.”

01:49:55.419 --> 01:49:59.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
The program will begin with a symposium
that will help prepare us

01:49:59.506 --> 01:50:03.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the “good news of peace”
at every opportunity.

01:50:05.179 --> 01:50:09.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones can look forward
to a special talk just for them

01:50:09.558 --> 01:50:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
given by a member of the Governing Body.

01:50:13.646 --> 01:50:17.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also see how brothers and sisters
are maintaining their peace

01:50:17.942 --> 01:50:21.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when suffering from illness,
economic problems,

01:50:21.779 --> 01:50:26.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters, and other difficulties.

01:50:26.325 --> 01:50:31.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course, our next session
includes the baptism talk,

01:50:31.038 --> 01:50:33.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
after which those who have been approved

01:50:33.457 --> 01:50:36.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be baptized locally.

01:50:36.293 --> 01:50:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have much to look forward to!

01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:42.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
To conclude today’s session,

01:50:42.633 --> 01:50:46.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s sing song number 112, entitled

01:50:46.053 --> 01:50:48.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, God of Peace.”

01:50:48.556 --> 01:50:52.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, that’s song number 112.

01:50:52.226 --> 01:50:56.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the song concludes,
you may have your own closing prayer.

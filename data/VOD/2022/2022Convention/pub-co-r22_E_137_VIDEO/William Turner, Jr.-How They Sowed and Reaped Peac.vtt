00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains
many fundamental principles

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:08.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Christian
can use every day to guide his life.

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:10.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 13:20, we’re told

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we ‘walk with wise persons,
we will become wise.’

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 28:20 states
that if ‘we’re faithful,

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will receive many blessings.’

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely you have Bible principles
that you live by as well.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as it pertains to pursuing peace,

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is one essential principle

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
that must be followed.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out what it is.

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Galatians chapter 6,

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read the words
of Galatians chapter 6,

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 7, 8.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read:

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be misled:

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is not one to be mocked.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For whatever a person is sowing,

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this he will also reap;

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the one sowing
with a view to his flesh

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will reap corruption from his flesh,

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the one sowing with a view to the spirit

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reap everlasting life from the spirit.”

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the principle:

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
We reap what we sow.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think of a farmer;

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knows that he must plant
what he hopes to reap.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also knows that he will not
reap fruitage right away,

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he trusts the results
will come in due time.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is similar with the quality of peace.

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only way for us to reap peace

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to sow it.

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:51.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we put in the work to achieve it,

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust that in due time

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will reap the benefits.

00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium, we will consider Bible
and modern-day accounts

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how Jehovah’s people,
despite particular challenges,

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:08.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
have reaped peace after first sowing it.

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one particular challenge
to gaining peace

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
is problems within the family.

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of imperfection,

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not uncommon to have disagreements,

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
even tension, from time to time.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And family members may hurt one another
in various ways.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And usually such offenses are minor,

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace can quickly be sown and reaped.

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:40.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if the offense is more serious?

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
A family member says or does something
that hurts us deeply.

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, even then,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
it still may be possible
to sow and reap peace.

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can prove this
by considering the Bible account

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Joseph and his brothers.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re familiar with the story.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:05.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of envy,
Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery.

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was by no means a minor offense.

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
It began with Joseph being led to Egypt.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, he was falsely accused
and thrown into prison.

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for 13 years,

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph suffered mistreatment
when he had done nothing to deserve it.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it could have been very easy
for Joseph to feel

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if he ever saw his brothers again,

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best option for peace

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:35.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be not to have any dealings
with them at all.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we might feel the same way as well.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Joseph didn’t do that.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, after some years passed,

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:48.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
both Joseph and his brothers sowed peace.

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, note how this was done.

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to the 105th Psalm,

00:03:56.215 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note the 19th verse of Psalm 105.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:09.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Until the time
that his word proved true,

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:12.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the saying of Jehovah

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what refined him.”

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph trusted in Jehovah to refine him,

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:23.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
to shape his thinking and godly qualities.

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
He refused to become bitter.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:28.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, how interesting it is to note

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is nothing
in the Scriptures to indicate

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Joseph ever told anyone,
not even Pharaoh,

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:38.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his brothers were the ones

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:42.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
who kidnapped him and sold him as a slave.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how about Joseph’s brothers?

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:49.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years after they had mistreated him,
they met Joseph in Egypt.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Joseph tested them
by giving the youngest brother, Benjamin,

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:56.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
significantly more attention
than he gave the others,

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:59.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saw that his brothers had changed.

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:02.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had let go of envy.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed genuine concern for their brother

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for their father, Jacob.

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:12.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph realized
that his brothers were repentant,

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:14.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he forgave them.

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because Joseph and his brothers
were willing to take steps to sow peace,

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:20.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
they reaped the benefits

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually were able to enjoy

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
a harmonious relationship.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can the example
of Joseph and his brothers

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us today?

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:36.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:40.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a family member sows peace.

00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every morning

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:57.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and I mean every morning—

00:05:57.127 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s Jeremy singing
at the top of his lungs.

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:01.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, I wasn’t the only one.

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:04.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but you were the loudest.

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always impressed
with how close you two were.

00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:16.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t always that way.

00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:18.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, it started out that way.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nick and I—we weren’t just brothers;

00:06:24.988 --> 00:06:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were friends.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:30.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the family business
ran into trouble,

00:06:30.994 --> 00:06:35.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what started
as a small disagreement just exploded.

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t even understand at all
how our business works!

00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:42.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of criticizing,
could you just once . . .

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:46.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremy!

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:50.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost us?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a choice.
You went behind my back!

00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:54.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your problem?

00:06:55.102 --> 00:06:57.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
You!
You’re the problem.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to work it out.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:12.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
But things just got worse.

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:18.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a door
had slammed shut between us.

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:22.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the outside,
I acted like everything was fine.

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:25.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
But inside, I couldn’t let it go.

00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:36.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like a total hypocrite,

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that had to change.

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let go

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:08.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to move on—

00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make things right with Nick.

00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:18.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took a long time
for the wounds to heal . . .

00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:25.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and for us to trust each other
the way we used to.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we did.

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:43.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful that we made peace

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:49.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the world turned upside down.

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:59.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can you and I
imitate Joseph and his brothers?

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:01.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss three steps.

00:09:01.603 --> 00:09:06.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first step is found at Ephesians 4:32.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:13.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ephesian 4:32:

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But become kind to one another,

00:09:19.037 --> 00:09:22.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tenderly compassionate,
freely forgiving one another

00:09:22.749 --> 00:09:25.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as God also by Christ

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:27.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
freely forgave you.”

00:09:28.922 --> 00:09:33.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first, we must be ready to forgive.

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:39.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we let grievances and resentment build up
and develop in our hearts,

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:43.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes even more difficult
to be forgiving.

00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:47.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note in the video that what started
as a small disagreement

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Nick and Jeremy exploded
into something much bigger?

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremy could not let go
of his resentment toward his brother.

00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:02.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must work to treat others
in a forgiving way,

00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:05.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Jehovah treats us.

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:09.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second step:

00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t dwell on the offense.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 17:9 says:
“The one who keeps harping on a matter

00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:20.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
separates close friends.”

00:10:20.807 --> 00:10:24.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that how Jeremy described
the relationship with his brother?

00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:28.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a door slammed shut between them.

00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:31.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t until steps were taken to sow peace

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:34.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
—having that open, honest communication
with each other;

00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:38.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
spending time together;
working with each other in the ministry—

00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:43.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
only then did things start to improve.

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:45.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice?

00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:49.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything did not go back
to normal right away.

00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:53.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took time to reap peace,

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:56.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
time for those wounds to heal,

00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:59.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
time to regain lost trust.

00:11:00.764 --> 00:11:03.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can’t look for miracles,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we should look for progress.

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:11.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the farmer, trust that in due time

00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:15.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will see results from our efforts.

00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:21.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s where
the all-important third step comes in:

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:23.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask Jehovah in prayer

00:11:23.828 --> 00:11:28.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to let go of resentment.

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:30.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Psalm 105:19.

00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:34.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was “the saying of Jehovah”
that helped refine Joseph

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:37.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to develop the qualities needed
not to become bitter

00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:40.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to let go of any resentment.

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:45.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, Jeremy acknowledged
that he needed Jehovah’s help

00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:49.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let go and to move on.

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:51.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah can do the same for us.

00:11:53.817 --> 00:11:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not easy when we go through situations
that threaten the peace of our family.

00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we live by this fundamental principle

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we reap what we sow—

00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:08.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we can be assured
that with a forgiving spirit,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for opportunities to sow peace,

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:13.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beseeching Jehovah for his help

00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:16.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
our efforts will be blessed

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:20.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in due time, we and our family
can reap the benefits

00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:23.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy true peace.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:31.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:12:31.563 --> 00:12:35.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—The Gibeonites.”

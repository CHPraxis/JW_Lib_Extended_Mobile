00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome back, brothers and sisters,

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the second session

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 2022 “Pursue Peace”! Convention
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
This session corresponds

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Friday afternoon section
on your program,

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will continue
to develop the Scriptural theme

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Psalm 29:11:

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin with a music-video presentation.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s people,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
we love to tell others
about our God and our hope.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video
features brothers and sisters

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
sharing “the good news of peace”
around the globe.

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also see the work done
at various Bethel facilities

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
in support of this worldwide preaching work.

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy!

00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:48.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promises of peace
bring us great delight.

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:52.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think about
what life will be like in God’s new world,

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:57.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
it fills our hearts
with appreciation and love for Jehovah.

00:10:58.428 --> 00:11:00.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s express those feelings

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we sing song number 144,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize!”

00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:10.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 144.

00:13:18.234 --> 00:13:23.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Isaiah
contains many promises for the future.

00:13:23.114 --> 00:13:25.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you take time to contemplate

00:13:25.742 --> 00:13:28.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
what that future will be like?

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:31.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following five-part symposium

00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to picture
that wonderful time yet ahead.

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:38.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will also learn how Jehovah

00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:43.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
is fulfilling his promise
to care for his servants even now.

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:49.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Samuel Herd,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:52.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
will present the first talk,

00:13:52.477 --> 00:13:56.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Take Delight
in God’s Promises of Peace

00:13:56.398 --> 00:14:00.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘My Servants Will Eat . . .
My Servants Will Drink.’”

00:14:08.576 --> 00:14:11.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his Word, Jehovah has promised

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:14.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring peace to his loyal servants.

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:16.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve learned, that peace

00:14:16.793 --> 00:14:20.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more than the absence of conflict.

00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:22.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves our overall well-being,

00:14:22.924 --> 00:14:26.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
including our health and security.

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:29.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s heartwarming promises

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill us with appreciation and hope.

00:14:33.685 --> 00:14:37.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible in the 145th Psalm,

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:39.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us in verses 15 and 16:

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All eyes look hopefully to you;

00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:46.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you give them their food in its season.

00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:50.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You open your hand and satisfy the desire

00:14:50.118 --> 00:14:52.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
of every living thing.”

00:14:53.496 --> 00:14:57.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium, we will consider the past,

00:14:57.584 --> 00:15:00.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
present, and future fulfillment

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:04.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
of several Bible prophecies of peace

00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:07.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are found in the book of Isaiah.

00:15:07.844 --> 00:15:10.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises to provide an abundance

00:15:10.555 --> 00:15:14.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
of both literal food and spiritual food.

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:18.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Israelites loyally served Jehovah,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
they experienced the blessings foretold

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:24.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 49:10.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah’s servants are experiencing

00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:32.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of Isaiah 65:13, 14.

00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:35.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you’ll find it to say:

00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:40.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore this is what
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look!

00:15:42.962 --> 00:15:47.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My servants will eat,
but you will go hungry.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! My servants will drink,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but you will go thirsty.

00:15:53.431 --> 00:15:56.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! My servants will rejoice,

00:15:56.017 --> 00:15:58.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but you will suffer shame.

00:15:58.478 --> 00:16:02.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! My servants will shout joyfully

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because of the good condition of the heart,

00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:10.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but you will cry out
because of the pain of heart

00:16:10.114 --> 00:16:13.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will wail
because of a broken spirit.’”

00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:19.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we may at times
experience literal hunger,

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:24.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy an abundance
of satisfying spiritual food.

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:26.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the future,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will
completely eliminate literal hunger.

00:16:31.386 --> 00:16:34.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:38.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about the blessings we enjoy now

00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:41.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ones we will enjoy in the future.

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:46.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Isaiah,

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:49.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised to feed his servants

00:16:51.781 --> 00:16:54.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically

00:16:55.743 --> 00:16:58.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritually.

00:17:05.503 --> 00:17:09.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah invites us to a banquet

00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:13.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is spiritually nourishing.

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible-based videos and publications

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:27.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
draw us close to God

00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:35.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satisfy our hunger for truth.

00:17:39.245 --> 00:17:41.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:45.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
abundant, healthy food will be more

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:46.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
than a promise

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it will be a reality.

00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:18.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:21.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.”

00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to be among Jehovah’s people!

00:18:29.837 --> 00:18:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spiritual provisions flow to us

00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:37.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
like an ever-broadening
and ever-deepening river.

00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:41.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s not a grain of salt missing

00:18:41.307 --> 00:18:44.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor a slice of bread
nor a pat of butter missing.

00:18:46.854 --> 00:18:51.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is way too much to eat at one meal.

00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:55.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to come
to Jehovah’s table several times a week

00:18:55.196 --> 00:18:58.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep our spiritual fiber intact

00:18:58.491 --> 00:19:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and energy strong

00:19:00.743 --> 00:19:03.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the work we engage in

00:19:03.287 --> 00:19:06.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Kingdom preaching.

00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:10.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have an abundance of nourishing food

00:19:10.294 --> 00:19:14.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Bible-based publications,

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:17.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
recordings and videos,

00:19:17.135 --> 00:19:19.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
meetings and conventions,

00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:22.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
website material.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has not deviated from his promise.

00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:30.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note this one, Psalm 72:16:

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:35.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.

00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:43.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon,

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:45.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in the cities people will blossom

00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:47.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the vegetation of the earth.”

00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:54.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then again, Isaiah 30:23:

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:57.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will give the rain

00:19:57.341 --> 00:20:00.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the seed you sow in the ground,

00:20:00.887 --> 00:20:04.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the bread that the ground produces

00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be abundant and rich.

00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:11.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In that day your livestock will graze

00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:14.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spacious pastures.”

00:20:15.902 --> 00:20:19.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has placed
everything we need on the table.

00:20:20.907 --> 00:20:23.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must willfully come to the table

00:20:23.951 --> 00:20:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sit down and eat.

00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:29.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t make us come

00:20:29.123 --> 00:20:32.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
like some mothers may have
to demand a reluctant child

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to the house
from playing and eat a meal.

00:20:38.382 --> 00:20:43.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be sure to thank Jehovah
for the spiritual food he provides.

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:48.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 100:2, 3 reminds us:

00:20:48.976 --> 00:20:52.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:57.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Come into his presence with joyful shouting.

00:20:57.777 --> 00:21:02.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Know that Jehovah is God.

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:06.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is the one who made us,
and we belong to him.

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are his people
and the sheep of his pasture.”

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:14.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show your appreciation.

00:21:14.585 --> 00:21:15.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
By studying diligently
and applying what you learn.

00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:24.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you lack sufficient material things now,

00:21:24.512 --> 00:21:29.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
take delight in meditating
on future Kingdom blessings.

00:21:29.475 --> 00:21:32.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will surely fulfill his promises,

00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:35.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he has always done.

00:21:35.523 --> 00:21:38.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 55:10, 11 reminds us:

00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:43.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For just as the rain and the snow

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:45.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pour down from heaven

00:21:45.199 --> 00:21:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not return there

00:21:47.076 --> 00:21:50.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until they saturate the earth,

00:21:50.204 --> 00:21:53.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making it produce and sprout,

00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:58.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“giving seed to the sower
and bread to the eater,

00:21:58.588 --> 00:22:03.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so my word that goes out
of my mouth will be.

00:22:03.384 --> 00:22:06.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not return to me without results,

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:09.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but it will certainly accomplish

00:22:09.265 --> 00:22:12.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whatever is my delight,

00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:15.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it will have sure success

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:17.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what I send it to do.”

00:22:19.442 --> 00:22:22.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:22:22.862 --> 00:22:26.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:22:26.949 --> 00:22:30.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace

00:22:30.828 --> 00:22:35.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They Will Build Houses and . . .
Plant Vineyards.’”

00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:47.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it sounds too good to be true,
it probably is.”

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
This familiar saying might be true
with human promises,

00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:56.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s certainly not true
with promises from Jehovah.

00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:59.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
They always come true.

00:22:59.273 --> 00:23:03.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just before his death at the age of 110,

00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:05.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua reminded the Israelites

00:23:05.988 --> 00:23:09.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
why Jehovah’s promises
can always be trusted.

00:23:09.992 --> 00:23:14.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Not one word
out of all the good promises

00:23:14.664 --> 00:23:18.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah your God
has spoken to you has failed.

00:23:18.042 --> 00:23:21.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have all come true for you.”

00:23:21.128 --> 00:23:24.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among all of Jehovah’s good promises

00:23:24.257 --> 00:23:27.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the heartwarming restoration promises

00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
given to the Jews returning
from exile in Babylon.

00:23:31.472 --> 00:23:35.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the land of Judah
had lain desolate for 70 years,

00:23:35.309 --> 00:23:39.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jews wouldn’t have expected brand
new homes waiting for them to occupy

00:23:39.563 --> 00:23:42.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fields ready for them to harvest.

00:23:42.692 --> 00:23:46.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
There would be much work
for them to do once they arrived.

00:23:46.904 --> 00:23:50.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many unknowns
about their future,

00:23:50.032 --> 00:23:54.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
which could have caused some to worry,
or to be anxious.

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some family heads might have wondered:
‘Where will we live?

00:23:58.708 --> 00:24:02.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will I feed my family
and keep them safe?’

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah calmed their hearts
with the reassuring promises

00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:10.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Isaiah 65:21, 22.

00:24:10.928 --> 00:24:12.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read these together.

00:24:12.805 --> 00:24:16.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Isaiah 65:21, 22,

00:24:16.976 --> 00:24:19.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there it reads:

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses
and live in them,

00:24:22.064 --> 00:24:25.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:28.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:24:28.654 --> 00:24:31.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:24:31.824 --> 00:24:35.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:40.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:24:41.584 --> 00:24:45.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
These promises
must have strengthened the Jews.

00:24:45.546 --> 00:24:49.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah didn’t say that ‘they <i>might </i>
build and live in their own homes,

00:24:49.342 --> 00:24:52.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they <i>might</i>  enjoy the fruitage
from their own vineyards.’

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:56.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he told his precious chosen ones

00:24:56.432 --> 00:25:01.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they <i>will</i>  enjoy
these promises to the full.

00:25:01.437 --> 00:25:04.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though they
hadn’t been told every detail

00:25:04.732 --> 00:25:08.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there were many unknowns
regarding their future,

00:25:08.652 --> 00:25:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
they knew their God, Jehovah.

00:25:11.405 --> 00:25:14.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that his promises
were for their good

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they would all come true.

00:25:18.287 --> 00:25:21.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those promises did come true.

00:25:21.165 --> 00:25:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that God fulfilled
all of his promises in the past

00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:28.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthens our trust and confidence

00:25:28.672 --> 00:25:31.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of his promises for the future,

00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:33.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the ones that we read in Isaiah 65,

00:25:33.969 --> 00:25:38.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
will all come true for our everlasting good.

00:25:38.641 --> 00:25:43.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joy it will be to build
and then live in our own home,

00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:45.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
never having to worry that we will lose it

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a natural disaster
or economic collapse!

00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:54.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, though, many of our
brothers and sisters today

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
do suffer the harsh realities
of living in this old system of things.

00:25:59.495 --> 00:26:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
a sister in Poland named Gabriela

00:26:03.499 --> 00:26:08.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced great loss when her home
was nearly destroyed by a flood.

00:26:08.504 --> 00:26:11.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did she maintain her joy?

00:26:11.173 --> 00:26:14.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what she said:

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t want to talk about what I lost
—those are just material things.

00:26:19.515 --> 00:26:23.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, I want to tell you
how much I gained.

00:26:23.936 --> 00:26:26.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This experience reassured me

00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:30.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that being a part of the Christian
congregation is a unique privilege

00:26:30.943 --> 00:26:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as a source of joy and happiness.”

00:26:34.697 --> 00:26:39.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
So although she went through some
very difficult times, what did she gain?

00:26:39.285 --> 00:26:41.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy and happiness.

00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about a single sister
from Puerto Rico named Anel?

00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:48.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
She endured a very difficult test

00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:52.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in 2017 when Hurricane Maria
destroyed her home.

00:26:52.798 --> 00:26:56.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of that storm, she lost her job.

00:26:56.552 --> 00:26:58.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what she recalled:

00:26:58.804 --> 00:27:03.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During those difficult days,
I felt anxious

00:27:03.184 --> 00:27:07.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I learned to trust in Jehovah
through prayer

00:27:07.062 --> 00:27:10.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not let anxiety paralyze me.”

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:12.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also said:

00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:17.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Following the direction of the organization
helped me to remain calm.

00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:21.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I saw Jehovah’s hand
in the spiritual encouragement I received

00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:25.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as well as the material assistance
provided by the brotherhood.

00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:30.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah gave me much more than
I could even ask for, and my faith

00:27:30.836 --> 00:27:33.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
was greatly strengthened.”

00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:37.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she received assistance from Jehovah
—from his organization—

00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:39.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she was greatly strengthened.

00:27:40.971 --> 00:27:42.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:27:42.973 --> 00:27:46.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you suffering some sort of storm
in your life,

00:27:46.727 --> 00:27:48.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps from a natural disaster

00:27:48.938 --> 00:27:51.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe a figurative one

00:27:51.232 --> 00:27:53.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused by a health issue,

00:27:53.275 --> 00:27:56.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
a family problem,
or some injustice?

00:27:56.904 --> 00:27:58.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
During such times,

00:27:58.906 --> 00:28:02.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s normal to experience
feelings of anxiety,

00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:05.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
worry about our future,
the safety of our family.

00:28:05.996 --> 00:28:10.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t allow such feelings
to paralyze you.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Gabriela and Anel,

00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:17.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep doing what you can
and continue trusting in Jehovah.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, continue to trust
in our loving brotherhood.

00:28:21.845 --> 00:28:25.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters are true friends

00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:30.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are ready to show love
in our time of distress.

00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:32.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will quickly come to our aid

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:37.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
by providing practical assistance
and relief provisions.

00:28:37.069 --> 00:28:41.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will help us rebuild our home
and rebuild our life.

00:28:41.824 --> 00:28:46.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will build us up and stabilize us
with words of encouragement.

00:28:47.496 --> 00:28:51.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we put our complete trust in Jehovah
and his promises,

00:28:51.834 --> 00:28:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
we receive the best protection possible.

00:28:55.004 --> 00:29:00.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the psalmist wrote
at Psalm 91:1, 2.

00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:03.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 91:1, 2 says:

00:29:03.596 --> 00:29:05.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Anyone dwelling in the secret place

00:29:05.889 --> 00:29:10.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the Most High will lodge
under the shadow of the Almighty.

00:29:10.394 --> 00:29:12.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will say to Jehovah:

00:29:12.396 --> 00:29:15.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You are my refuge and my stronghold,

00:29:15.274 --> 00:29:19.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
my God in whom I trust.’”

00:29:19.069 --> 00:29:23.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful reminder
of protection from Jehovah!

00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:27.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is
“the secret place of the Most High”?

00:29:27.494 --> 00:29:31.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a figurative place
of spiritual security and protection.

00:29:31.999 --> 00:29:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who dwell, or lodge,
with God as his personal guests

00:29:36.712 --> 00:29:40.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain there are safe from anything

00:29:40.382 --> 00:29:43.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
or anyone that threatens their faith

00:29:43.469 --> 00:29:46.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their love for God.

00:29:46.388 --> 00:29:51.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure that Jehovah
will never abandon those who trust in him

00:29:51.268 --> 00:29:54.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not now, not ever.

00:29:54.813 --> 00:29:57.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:29:57.399 --> 00:30:00.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
envision the secure future that lies ahead

00:30:00.444 --> 00:30:03.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we will enjoy complete security.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you long for a home of your own?

00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:15.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised the returning exiles

00:30:15.292 --> 00:30:19.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they would build
and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:30:29.973 --> 00:30:32.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah likewise cares for us,

00:30:32.476 --> 00:30:34.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we lose our home

00:30:34.645 --> 00:30:36.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we’re taken from it.

00:30:43.028 --> 00:30:45.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all,

00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:48.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
true worship provides spiritual security

00:30:48.367 --> 00:30:51.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is found nowhere else.

00:30:56.834 --> 00:31:00.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual home we have now

00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:02.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us that Jehovah will give us

00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:04.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
a physical place to call home

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new world.

00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:36.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses and live in them.”

00:31:43.088 --> 00:31:45.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful video!

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:48.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us imagine
what we will experience

00:31:48.594 --> 00:31:52.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the near future
when all of God’s promises

00:31:52.097 --> 00:31:57.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
become a reality on a paradise earth
and when we truly are safe

00:31:57.102 --> 00:31:59.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cared for in every way

00:31:59.438 --> 00:32:03.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
—physically, spiritually, and emotionally.

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:07.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to read another
comforting promise from Jehovah?

00:32:07.446 --> 00:32:12.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Isaiah 65:23.

00:32:12.284 --> 00:32:16.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there it says:
“They will not toil for nothing,

00:32:16.288 --> 00:32:19.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor will they bear children for distress,

00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:21.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they are the offspring

00:32:21.168 --> 00:32:25.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
made up of those blessed by Jehovah,
and their descendants with them.”

00:32:26.673 --> 00:32:30.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
This must have brought
great comfort to the Jews.

00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:33.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how comforting it is for us today!

00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:35.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

00:32:35.557 --> 00:32:38.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
all families will experience
Jehovah’s blessing

00:32:38.936 --> 00:32:43.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy the results of their hard work.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:48.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
if you have lost your home or possessions

00:32:48.195 --> 00:32:50.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if you experience loss in the future,

00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:54.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep focusing on Jehovah’s good promises.

00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:58.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strong faith can help you
to weather any storm

00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:02.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
—literal or figurative.

00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:04.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust that Jehovah will hear

00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:08.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and respond to your needs,
even anticipating them.

00:33:08.882 --> 00:33:11.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promises to “open [his] hand

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satisfy the [proper] desire
of every living thing.”

00:33:15.597 --> 00:33:20.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
That promise includes you and your family.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to take delight
in all of God’s promises,

00:33:24.439 --> 00:33:29.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that “not one word
out of all the good promises

00:33:29.111 --> 00:33:32.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah your God has spoken
to you has failed.

00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:35.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
They [will] all come true for you.”

00:33:37.411 --> 00:33:40.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Leonard Myers,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:33:40.831 --> 00:33:43.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:33:43.834 --> 00:33:46.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace

00:33:46.837 --> 00:33:50.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘The Wolf and the Lamb
Will Feed Together.’”

00:33:57.806 --> 00:33:59.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we continue our consideration

00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:03.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the promises of peace
in Isaiah’s prophecies,

00:34:03.228 --> 00:34:07.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like you to imagine
an Israelite living in Babylon.

00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:10.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he’s just learned
that Jews can return to Jerusalem

00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:12.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help to rebuild the temple.

00:34:12.696 --> 00:34:16.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he must decide
if he and his family will leave Babylon

00:34:16.283 --> 00:34:19.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the long trip to his homeland.

00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:21.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
What might he consider?

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after 70 years,
the land must have changed.

00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:28.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fields would be overgrown with weeds.

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:32.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wolves, leopards, lions, and bears
must freely walk in the fields.

00:34:32.758 --> 00:34:35.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Snakes make their home there.

00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:37.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he might ask himself:

00:34:37.804 --> 00:34:41.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will my domestic animals
be killed by predators?

00:34:41.558 --> 00:34:44.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will my small children be bitten by snakes?

00:34:44.937 --> 00:34:49.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the danger of fierce men
attacking us on the journey home?’

00:34:50.734 --> 00:34:53.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, any such fears could be dispelled

00:34:53.195 --> 00:34:57.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
by considering the prophecy at Isaiah 11:6-9.

00:34:57.908 --> 00:35:00.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together.

00:35:00.535 --> 00:35:02.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah chapter 11

00:35:02.746 --> 00:35:04.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and notice this promise of peace—

00:35:04.957 --> 00:35:07.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting in verse 6:

00:35:07.376 --> 00:35:11.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wolf will reside for a while
with the lamb,

00:35:11.338 --> 00:35:15.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with the young goat
the leopard will lie down,

00:35:15.008 --> 00:35:20.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the calf and the lion
and the fattened animal will all be together;

00:35:20.013 --> 00:35:22.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a little boy will lead them.

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:25.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The cow and the bear will feed together,

00:35:25.769 --> 00:35:28.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their young will lie down together.

00:35:28.313 --> 00:35:31.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The lion will eat straw like the bull.

00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:35.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The nursing child
will play over the lair of a cobra,

00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:40.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a weaned child will put his hand
over the den of a poisonous snake.

00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:44.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will not cause any harm or any ruin

00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:46.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all my holy mountain,

00:35:46.456 --> 00:35:50.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the earth will certainly be filled
with the knowledge of Jehovah

00:35:50.502 --> 00:35:52.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the waters cover the sea.”

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful promise of peace!

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jews wouldn’t need to fear
wild animals or fierce men

00:36:00.971 --> 00:36:04.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their journey home
or in their restored land.

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:06.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
With these poetic words,

00:36:06.935 --> 00:36:11.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured the exiles
that they and their livestock would be safe.

00:36:11.148 --> 00:36:14.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would bless them with peace.

00:36:14.026 --> 00:36:16.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice, according to verse 7,

00:36:16.695 --> 00:36:19.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the lion would symbolically eat straw,

00:36:19.948 --> 00:36:23.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrating that lions
wouldn’t kill the Jews’ cattle?

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithful ones would have nothing to fear
from animal or human predators.

00:36:30.375 --> 00:36:34.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see this prophecy
being fulfilled in our day?

00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:36.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not with the literal animals,

00:36:36.089 --> 00:36:39.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do see a spiritual fulfillment.

00:36:39.426 --> 00:36:42.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice again, the end of verse 9.

00:36:42.179 --> 00:36:46.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “The earth will certainly be filled
with the knowledge of Jehovah.”

00:36:47.642 --> 00:36:51.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, does the knowledge of Jehovah
change the behavior of animals?

00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:55.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but the knowledge of God
does change people.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:00.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our day, the knowledge of Jehovah
helps people who are violent

00:37:00.197 --> 00:37:04.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to transform their personality
and become peaceable.

00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:07.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with Colossians 3:10,

00:37:07.329 --> 00:37:11.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
these ones have ‘clothed themselves
with the new personality.’

00:37:11.666 --> 00:37:15.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve stripped off
animalistic, violent tendencies

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
and transformed their lives
in harmony with what the Bible teaches.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
They get along peaceably with others.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you know someone
who made such changes.

00:37:26.598 --> 00:37:29.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you made these changes,

00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:31.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving behind a violent way of life.

00:37:33.063 --> 00:37:36.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me share with you such an experience.

00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:38.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
A man named José

00:37:38.193 --> 00:37:42.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
was trained in the martial arts
and in the use of weapons.

00:37:42.072 --> 00:37:44.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had broken the law so many times

00:37:44.407 --> 00:37:47.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was brought to trial on 22 counts

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

00:37:50.205 --> 00:37:54.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was so violent
that even fellow inmates were afraid of him,

00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:57.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was kept in a high-security cell.

00:37:58.421 --> 00:38:01.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
For seven years, his fleshly sister,

00:38:01.258 --> 00:38:04.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
visited him.

00:38:04.219 --> 00:38:06.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he always rejected the Bible’s message.

00:38:07.848 --> 00:38:10.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, though,
he accepted one of our publications,

00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:13.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a Bible study was started.

00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:17.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away,
he made tremendous changes in his conduct.

00:38:17.315 --> 00:38:21.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
One week later,
he gave a personal witness to 200 prisoners

00:38:21.778 --> 00:38:24.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the following week to 600 more.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even received permission
to visit the inmates in other prison blocks.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, because of the remarkable change
in his behavior,

00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:36.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
his sentence was reduced to 15 years.

00:38:36.877 --> 00:38:41.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, after serving just ten years,
he was released from prison.

00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:46.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
José was eventually baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:38:46.386 --> 00:38:50.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly a case
of ‘the wolf residing with the lamb.’

00:38:51.683 --> 00:38:56.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the future fulfillment
of Isaiah 11:6-9?

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the earthly Paradise
that God has promised,

00:38:59.691 --> 00:39:02.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be delightful peace among humans

00:39:02.694 --> 00:39:05.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and between humans and animals.

00:39:05.238 --> 00:39:07.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you long for that time?

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:39:10.952 --> 00:39:14.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the peace we enjoy
with fellow believers now

00:39:14.289 --> 00:39:19.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just imagine the peace
that we’ll enjoy in Paradise.

00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:24.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel during a long journey

00:39:24.758 --> 00:39:28.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you might meet
wild animals and criminals along the road?

00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:35.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured the returning exiles
that they would return

00:39:35.143 --> 00:39:39.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
in safety and dwell in peace.

00:39:41.066 --> 00:39:43.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now,

00:39:43.443 --> 00:39:46.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who were once violent

00:39:51.076 --> 00:39:53.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
have learned to be humble,

00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:56.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving, and peaceable.

00:40:09.052 --> 00:40:12.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the peace
that will reign in God’s new world,

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we can wander this beautiful globe,

00:40:31.074 --> 00:40:32.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
explore every corner,

00:40:47.132 --> 00:40:50.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and admire the handiwork of the true God

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no fear.

00:41:06.067 --> 00:41:09.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:14.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all my holy mountain,’ says Jehovah.”

00:41:19.581 --> 00:41:22.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the video showed,
people who were once violent

00:41:22.792 --> 00:41:26.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
have learned to be
humble, loving, and peaceable.

00:41:26.338 --> 00:41:29.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did you feel
when you saw scenes in the video

00:41:29.716 --> 00:41:33.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
of humans so close to wild animals?

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promise of peace among humans

00:41:36.431 --> 00:41:39.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace between humans and animals
is thrilling!

00:41:40.977 --> 00:41:44.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice
what Isaiah further wrote about this peace

00:41:44.439 --> 00:41:46.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah chapter 65.

00:41:46.649 --> 00:41:49.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn there with me
—Isaiah 65.

00:41:49.444 --> 00:41:53.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these are words similar to those
we read earlier in Isaiah chapter 11.

00:41:54.449 --> 00:41:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 65:25:

00:41:58.536 --> 00:42:01.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The wolf and the lamb will feed together,

00:42:01.831 --> 00:42:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the lion will eat straw just like the bull,

00:42:04.667 --> 00:42:07.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the serpent’s food will be dust.

00:42:07.796 --> 00:42:11.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:14.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all my holy mountain,’ says Jehovah.”

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:19.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Skilled artists in the Art Department
at world headquarters

00:42:19.432 --> 00:42:21.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautifully illustrate such scenes,

00:42:21.851 --> 00:42:24.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the images can be found
in our publications.

00:42:25.271 --> 00:42:28.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what Isaiah describes
is no artist’s rendition.

00:42:28.817 --> 00:42:31.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will be real.

00:42:31.528 --> 00:42:35.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how you’ll feel
when you’re not afraid of wild animals

00:42:35.448 --> 00:42:37.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the animals aren’t afraid of you.

00:42:39.369 --> 00:42:42.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we look forward
to that future promise of peace,

00:42:42.914 --> 00:42:45.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
what can we do now to pursue peace?

00:42:46.835 --> 00:42:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing is to contribute
to the peace of our spiritual paradise,

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
the secure,
spiritually prosperous environment

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:57.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which we worship Jehovah.

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:01.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus stated at Matthew 5:9:

00:43:01.266 --> 00:43:03.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the peacemakers.”

00:43:04.727 --> 00:43:08.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
A peacemaker is skilled
at restoring peace among brothers

00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:10.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
when peace is disturbed.

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more important,
a peacemaker strives

00:43:13.278 --> 00:43:16.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to avoid disturbing peace in the first place.

00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:20.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does “peacemaker” describe you?

00:43:20.493 --> 00:43:24.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you contributing
to our spiritual paradise in that way?

00:43:25.707 --> 00:43:29.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else we can do
as we await the future fulfillment

00:43:29.043 --> 00:43:31.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the wolf and the lamb feeding together

00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:34.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to meditate on what it will be like

00:43:34.382 --> 00:43:37.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help resurrected ones who were violent

00:43:37.343 --> 00:43:39.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become peaceable.

00:43:39.596 --> 00:43:43.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine studying with a resurrected one
who had a violent background,

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:48.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
who perhaps experienced a violent death
because of a fierce personality.

00:43:49.147 --> 00:43:52.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will you reason with the person
from God’s Word

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him see the need to be a peacemaker?

00:43:55.904 --> 00:43:59.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
What examples of such transformations
will you share?

00:43:59.657 --> 00:44:02.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how will you explain
the prophecies of peace

00:44:02.952 --> 00:44:05.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah chapter 11, verses 6 through 9

00:44:05.747 --> 00:44:08.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chapter 65, verse 25?

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage all of you to think deeply

00:44:14.005 --> 00:44:18.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how this promise of peace
was fulfilled for the ancient Jews,

00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:20.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the promise is being fulfilled today,

00:44:20.678 --> 00:44:25.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what life on earth will be like
when it’s fulfilled in the future.

00:44:25.308 --> 00:44:29.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us take delight
in the peaceful promise

00:44:29.687 --> 00:44:32.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the wolf and the lamb feeding together.

00:44:35.193 --> 00:44:38.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother James Mantz,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:44:38.363 --> 00:44:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:45.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace

00:44:45.078 --> 00:44:48.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘No Resident Will Say: “I am Sick.”’”

00:44:57.048 --> 00:45:00.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Great Healer.

00:45:00.051 --> 00:45:02.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only he can make the promise:

00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say, ‘I am sick.’”

00:45:06.182 --> 00:45:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we be confident

00:45:08.184 --> 00:45:10.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is going to keep his promise

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring an end to all sickness?

00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:15.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find assurance

00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:19.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the words of Isaiah 35:5, 6.

00:45:19.571 --> 00:45:22.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles to that scripture.

00:45:22.532 --> 00:45:27.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read a promise of healing
that Jehovah made to the nation of Israel.

00:45:27.412 --> 00:45:29.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
This promise gives us hope

00:45:29.914 --> 00:45:33.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it was actually fulfilled
on a small scale

00:45:33.293 --> 00:45:36.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 2,500 years ago.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:42.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 35:5, 6 reads:

00:45:42.176 --> 00:45:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time
the eyes of the blind will be opened,

00:45:46.222 --> 00:45:49.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

00:45:49.475 --> 00:45:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time
the lame will leap like the deer,

00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the tongue of the speechless
will shout for joy.

00:45:56.399 --> 00:45:59.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For waters will burst forth
in the wilderness,

00:45:59.402 --> 00:46:02.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
and streams in the desert plain.”

00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:07.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah recorded this promise 125 years

00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:11.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the Babylonian army
destroyed Jerusalem.

00:46:11.414 --> 00:46:15.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was fulfilled
after Jehovah freed the Israelites

00:46:15.376 --> 00:46:18.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Babylonian captivity in 537 B.C.E.

00:46:18.963 --> 00:46:21.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restored them
to their homeland in Israel.

00:46:22.925 --> 00:46:24.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you may ask,

00:46:24.969 --> 00:46:29.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Were the blind, deaf, lame, and speechless

00:46:29.015 --> 00:46:31.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
really healed at that time?’

00:46:31.726 --> 00:46:35.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer,
we need to apply a basic principle:

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah restores what was lost.

00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:42.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the 70 years of exile,

00:46:42.528 --> 00:46:47.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not punish the Israelites
by striking them with physical blindness,

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
deafness, lameness, and loss of speech.

00:46:51.454 --> 00:46:54.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore,
their restoration would not require

00:46:54.957 --> 00:46:58.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
the healing of their physical disabilities.

00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:03.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
these afflictions are a good description

00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the self-inflicted spiritual sickness

00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:10.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had caused the nation
to fall into apostasy

00:47:10.014 --> 00:47:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lose Jehovah’s favor.

00:47:13.476 --> 00:47:16.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw their repentant attitude

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:20.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their desire to restore
true worship in Jerusalem.

00:47:20.358 --> 00:47:22.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
He healed their spiritual sickness

00:47:22.985 --> 00:47:24.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving their sins

00:47:24.987 --> 00:47:27.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restoring them to his favor.

00:47:28.658 --> 00:47:33.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
they came to their spiritual senses.

00:47:33.621 --> 00:47:36.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
They regained their spiritual vision

00:47:36.249 --> 00:47:39.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their ability to hear, obey,

00:47:39.419 --> 00:47:42.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speak Jehovah’s word.

00:47:42.547 --> 00:47:44.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
No longer spiritually lame,

00:47:44.924 --> 00:47:48.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were energized
to carry on Jehovah’s pure worship.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly today, we are eyewitnesses.

00:47:54.308 --> 00:47:56.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we are the beneficiaries

00:47:56.894 --> 00:48:01.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a worldwide spiritual healing program.

00:48:01.274 --> 00:48:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah heals us spiritually by freeing us

00:48:04.152 --> 00:48:08.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
from false religious teachings
and unclean practices.

00:48:08.114 --> 00:48:11.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has brought us into a spiritual paradise,

00:48:11.743 --> 00:48:16.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
where our spiritual strength
is renewed day by day.

00:48:16.748 --> 00:48:18.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a spiritual sense,

00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:21.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
the blind are learning to see

00:48:21.294 --> 00:48:24.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deaf are learning to hear.

00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:31.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is spiritual healing the only part
of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise?

00:48:31.345 --> 00:48:32.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:48:32.972 --> 00:48:37.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles to Isaiah 33:24.

00:48:37.977 --> 00:48:42.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read this verse,
pay attention to the latter part,

00:48:42.607 --> 00:48:45.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it contains
the key to understanding

00:48:45.693 --> 00:48:49.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
why physical healing
is included in God’s promise:

00:48:49.864 --> 00:48:52.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:57.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 33:24 says:

00:48:57.747 --> 00:49:01.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’

00:49:01.334 --> 00:49:06.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people dwelling in the land
will be pardoned for their error.”

00:49:07.673 --> 00:49:10.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that the end of sickness

00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:15.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
is related to our being pardoned
for our errors, or sins?

00:49:15.306 --> 00:49:18.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, that ties the fulfillment

00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:20.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a spiritual healing.

00:49:20.895 --> 00:49:25.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, our imperfect, sinful condition

00:49:25.107 --> 00:49:28.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
is also the reason
that we get physically sick.

00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:31.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, in the new world,

00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:36.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the basis of the healing power
of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice,

00:49:36.452 --> 00:49:41.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will experience
a healing of our physical sicknesses.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promise
that “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’”

00:49:45.628 --> 00:49:49.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come true in the complete sense.

00:49:51.592 --> 00:49:53.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:49:53.928 --> 00:49:57.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about the spiritual blessings
we enjoy now

00:49:57.598 --> 00:50:01.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imagine what our lives
will be like in the future

00:50:01.352 --> 00:50:05.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
when all our physical ailments
will be healed.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:11.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clear instruction from Jehovah

00:50:12.822 --> 00:50:15.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us close to him

00:50:18.244 --> 00:50:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintains spiritual health.

00:50:24.208 --> 00:50:27.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
While false teachings hold many

00:50:27.128 --> 00:50:29.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the grip of spiritual darkness,

00:50:31.465 --> 00:50:34.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah offers true freedom.

00:50:51.652 --> 00:50:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:50:55.197 --> 00:50:59.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us
that perfect physical and mental health

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
await us in Paradise.

00:51:18.638 --> 00:51:20.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine waking every day

00:51:24.518 --> 00:51:27.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
feeling clean,

00:51:28.356 --> 00:51:30.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
healthy,

00:51:33.402 --> 00:51:35.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy,

00:51:35.488 --> 00:51:38.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full of the joy of life.

00:51:52.964 --> 00:51:55.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises:

00:51:55.383 --> 00:51:58.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:52:04.892 --> 00:52:08.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
How refreshing and heartwarming

00:52:08.062 --> 00:52:11.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think of the global healing
that lies ahead!

00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are confident
that this is going to happen.

00:52:14.777 --> 00:52:16.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:52:16.404 --> 00:52:18.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we have already experienced

00:52:18.531 --> 00:52:21.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has healed us spiritually.

00:52:21.909 --> 00:52:26.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind
the powerful statement from the video:

00:52:26.372 --> 00:52:29.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“reminds us that perfect physical
and mental health

00:52:33.462 --> 00:52:36.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
await us in Paradise.”

00:52:37.216 --> 00:52:39.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also learned from the video

00:52:39.385 --> 00:52:43.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
that clear instruction from Jehovah
draws us close to him

00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:47.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helps us to maintain
our spiritual health today.

00:52:47.727 --> 00:52:52.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to be taught by Jehovah!

00:52:53.607 --> 00:52:56.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can show our appreciation
for this spiritual healing

00:52:56.986 --> 00:52:59.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
by thanking Jehovah in prayer.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 40:5 mentions another way
we can thank the Great Healer

00:53:04.744 --> 00:53:08.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all he has done and will do for us.

00:53:08.831 --> 00:53:10.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it.

00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:14.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 40:5 says:

00:53:14.128 --> 00:53:17.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How many things you have done,
O Jehovah my God,

00:53:17.673 --> 00:53:21.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your wonderful works
and your thoughts toward us.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“None can compare to you;

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:26.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if I were to try to tell and speak of them,

00:53:26.557 --> 00:53:29.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be too numerous to recount!”

00:53:31.187 --> 00:53:33.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our gratitude to Jehovah

00:53:33.397 --> 00:53:38.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
will move us to tell others
about Jehovah’s wonderful works,

00:53:38.277 --> 00:53:42.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak of the many things he has done.

00:53:42.406 --> 00:53:45.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will never run out of good things

00:53:45.701 --> 00:53:48.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say about our God.

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who respond favorably

00:53:50.289 --> 00:53:53.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come to know Jehovah
as their Great Healer

00:53:53.918 --> 00:53:57.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy his friendship forever.

00:53:58.547 --> 00:54:03.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Granted, today many of us are dealing
with serious health challenges.

00:54:03.427 --> 00:54:08.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do what we can to share with others
this good news about healing.

00:54:08.307 --> 00:54:11.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we take delight in Jehovah’s promises,

00:54:11.894 --> 00:54:14.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
which cannot fail.

00:54:14.563 --> 00:54:16.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus was on earth,

00:54:16.607 --> 00:54:19.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
no sickness was beyond his ability to heal,

00:54:19.902 --> 00:54:24.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it was
physical, mental, or emotional.

00:54:24.406 --> 00:54:26.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

00:54:26.408 --> 00:54:30.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
such healings will take place
on a much grander scale

00:54:30.371 --> 00:54:34.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the cures will be permanent.

00:54:35.376 --> 00:54:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of the great crowd
will go through the great tribulation

00:54:38.921 --> 00:54:42.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
with serious, debilitating illnesses.

00:54:42.299 --> 00:54:45.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our publications have said
that it seems reasonable

00:54:45.594 --> 00:54:50.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expect that shortly after the destruction
of Satan’s system of things,

00:54:50.141 --> 00:54:54.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
miracles like those
that Jesus performed while on earth

00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:58.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
will no doubt take place on a global scale.

00:54:58.566 --> 00:55:02.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will allow all survivors
of the great tribulation

00:55:02.486 --> 00:55:05.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a satisfying share

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:09.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
in transforming this earth
into a beautiful paradise.

00:55:09.535 --> 00:55:12.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the end of Jesus’ Thousand Year Reign,

00:55:12.705 --> 00:55:17.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will reach the very fullness
of perfect human life.

00:55:18.836 --> 00:55:23.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we enjoy the rich blessings
of our spiritual paradise now,

00:55:23.382 --> 00:55:26.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s keep in mind
that these spiritual blessings

00:55:26.677 --> 00:55:31.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
are evidence that all the promises
of the Great Healer will come true.

00:55:31.473 --> 00:55:34.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will forever take delight

00:55:34.018 --> 00:55:37.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the complete fulfillment
of Jehovah’s promise

00:55:37.229 --> 00:55:40.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:55:42.818 --> 00:55:46.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:55:46.405 --> 00:55:50.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

00:55:50.159 --> 00:55:54.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace

00:55:54.246 --> 00:55:57.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘He Will Swallow Up Death Forever.’”

00:56:05.633 --> 00:56:08.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful and impressive

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:11.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
to realize that Jehovah promises

00:56:11.388 --> 00:56:16.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
to raise people from the dead
and to end death permanently!

00:56:17.728 --> 00:56:21.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to read with me
that comforting promise

00:56:21.815 --> 00:56:25.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in Isaiah chapter 25.

00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:28.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding our God, Jehovah,

00:56:28.239 --> 00:56:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 25:7, 8 says:

00:56:32.576 --> 00:56:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will do away with the shroud

00:56:35.037 --> 00:56:38.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is enveloping all the peoples

00:56:38.082 --> 00:56:40.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the covering that is woven

00:56:40.292 --> 00:56:42.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“over all the nations.

00:56:42.169 --> 00:56:44.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will swallow up death forever,

00:56:44.797 --> 00:56:47.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah

00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:51.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
will wipe away the tears from all faces.”

00:56:52.012 --> 00:56:57.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>
of September 15, 2014,

00:56:57.017 --> 00:56:59.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 25, said:

00:56:59.937 --> 00:57:04.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fittingly, the Bible refers
to inherited sin and death

00:57:04.942 --> 00:57:09.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as ‘the shroud
that is enveloping all the peoples

00:57:09.655 --> 00:57:14.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the covering
that is woven over all the nations.’

00:57:14.368 --> 00:57:18.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This suffocating covering, or shroud,

00:57:18.539 --> 00:57:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this intricate webwork of condemnation,

00:57:22.418 --> 00:57:24.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
entraps all people.”

00:57:25.963 --> 00:57:30.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do we know that Jehovah
can resurrect the dead?

00:57:30.884 --> 00:57:35.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he already brought his people
back to life figuratively in the past.

00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:42.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 537 before our Common Era,
Jehovah, in effect,

00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:45.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
raised the nation of Israel from the dead,

00:57:45.899 --> 00:57:48.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
restoring the people who were held captive

00:57:48.902 --> 00:57:53.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Babylon for 70 years to their homeland

00:57:53.115 --> 00:57:56.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reestablishing pure worship.

00:57:57.619 --> 00:58:01.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1919,
Jehovah freed his modern-day people

00:58:01.832 --> 00:58:06.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Babylon the Great,
the world empire of false religion,

00:58:06.795 --> 00:58:11.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
revitalizing them for renewed activity.

00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 26:19 prophesied this:

00:58:16.221 --> 00:58:18.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your dead will live.

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My corpses will rise up.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Awake and shout joyfully,

00:58:24.646 --> 00:58:26.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you residents in the dust!

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:29.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For your dew is as the dew

00:58:29.151 --> 00:58:32.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the morning, and the earth will let those

00:58:32.279 --> 00:58:34.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
powerless in death come to life.”

00:58:35.616 --> 00:58:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
When were God’s people held captive
by Babylon the Great?

00:58:40.162 --> 00:58:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
That spiritual captivity lasted
from the second century

00:58:44.166 --> 00:58:47.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Common Era to 1919,

00:58:47.503 --> 00:58:50.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
when anointed Christians were gathered

00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:53.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the restored congregation.

00:58:53.634 --> 00:58:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people were tested and refined

00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:59.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the years following the establishment

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:04.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s Kingdom in the heavens in 1914.

00:59:04.186 --> 00:59:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in 1919, Jesus appointed

00:59:08.273 --> 00:59:10.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:59:10.692 --> 00:59:14.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
over God’s cleansed people
to give them spiritual

00:59:14.113 --> 00:59:16.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“food at the proper time.”

00:59:16.573 --> 00:59:20.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the year that God’s people
started to return

00:59:20.994 --> 00:59:24.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their God-given spiritual estate.

00:59:24.248 --> 00:59:26.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was also the time when they

00:59:26.458 --> 00:59:31.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
were released from symbolic captivity
to Babylon the Great.

00:59:31.463 --> 00:59:34.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
How happy we can be, though,

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
that after God’s people experienced
centuries of spiritual oppression,

00:59:39.536 --> 00:59:43.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
we as God’s people
not only experience a spiritual restoration

00:59:43.832 --> 00:59:47.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a spiritual paradise
but also will see the fulfillment

00:59:47.878 --> 00:59:50.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Isaiah 25:8

00:59:50.797 --> 00:59:54.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
when God “[swallows] up death forever”!

00:59:54.968 --> 00:59:59.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah will end death forever.

00:59:59.556 --> 01:00:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a thrilling promise of peace!

01:00:03.477 --> 01:00:08.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us have not lost a loved one
to some disease,

01:00:08.023 --> 01:00:10.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even from COVID-19

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an accident or a disaster?

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:17.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
God here promises
that death will be no more,

01:00:17.574 --> 01:00:20.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
which suggests that the children who

01:00:20.285 --> 01:00:22.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be born then will not have to face

01:00:22.996 --> 01:00:27.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prospect of growing up and then
getting old, ending in death.

01:00:29.086 --> 01:00:31.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to Isaiah’s prophecy,

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:4 clearly states
a similar thought.

01:00:36.885 --> 01:00:41.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read that “death will be no more.”

01:00:42.432 --> 01:00:44.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

01:00:44.851 --> 01:00:47.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what Jehovah has already done

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:52.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show his love for us
and what he will do for us in the future.

01:00:55.737 --> 01:00:59.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:03.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
He restored that ruined nation

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:06.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if bringing it back to life.

01:01:10.544 --> 01:01:12.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1919,

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:15.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did something similar.

01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:21.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
He released his modern-day people
from spiritual captivity

01:01:23.932 --> 01:01:27.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and energized them to preach.

01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:36.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Jehovah raised his people
from figurative death,

01:01:36.945 --> 01:01:41.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
so will he reverse
the effects of literal death.

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:08.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, God “will swallow up death forever.”

01:02:13.482 --> 01:02:17.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine living longer than any tree

01:02:37.297 --> 01:02:41.301 line:10% position:50% align:center
because “death will be no more.”

01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:51.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we delight in the many things
Jehovah gives us!

01:02:51.978 --> 01:02:56.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we are privileged
to be among the only group of people

01:02:56.650 --> 01:03:01.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
who worship Jehovah
in the elevated way that he approves,

01:03:01.655 --> 01:03:06.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
as prophesied in Isaiah 2:2.

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about the overwhelming joy

01:03:09.621 --> 01:03:13.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will feel when Jehovah
resurrects our loved ones!

01:03:15.335 --> 01:03:20.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank Jehovah
for our precious resurrection hope.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 4:13 says:

01:03:25.262 --> 01:03:27.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, brothers,

01:03:27.264 --> 01:03:29.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we do not want you to be ignorant

01:03:29.558 --> 01:03:32.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about those who are sleeping in death,

01:03:32.018 --> 01:03:34.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may not sorrow

01:03:34.312 --> 01:03:37.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the rest do who have no hope.”

01:03:38.441 --> 01:03:43.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on it to strengthen
your faith and courage.

01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:46.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it important for us to do so?

01:03:46.783 --> 01:03:51.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the threat of death
is a powerful weapon.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those under Satan’s control
use it to force people to betray

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:59.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
their friends
or to give up their convictions.

01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:04.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that threat is powerless against us.

01:04:04.092 --> 01:04:07.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that if our enemies kill us,

01:04:07.804 --> 01:04:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will restore us to life.

01:04:10.807 --> 01:04:13.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are convinced that nothing

01:04:13.184 --> 01:04:16.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
they can do can sever

01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:20.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
our attachment to Jehovah.

01:04:20.108 --> 01:04:23.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
What remarkable wisdom
Jehovah has shown

01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:25.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving us the resurrection hope!

01:04:25.864 --> 01:04:29.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of it, he disarms Satan

01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:31.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
of one of his most effective weapons

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at the same time arms us

01:04:34.748 --> 01:04:37.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
with unbreakable courage.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:42.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that death is temporary
and that the life Jehovah

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:46.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
offers each of us will last forever.

01:04:48.845 --> 01:04:50.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium,

01:04:50.847 --> 01:04:55.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have learned how Jehovah
fulfilled his promises in the past,

01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:58.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he is fulfilling them today,

01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:02.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he will fulfill them in the future.

01:05:02.108 --> 01:05:07.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have seen,
God’s promises of peace include:

01:05:07.113 --> 01:05:12.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) nutritious spiritual
and physical food for all,

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:17.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) adequate housing and satisfying work,

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:23.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) freedom from the risk of violence,

01:05:24.255 --> 01:05:27.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) perfect physical health,

01:05:28.843 --> 01:05:32.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (5) the elimination of death.

01:05:34.099 --> 01:05:37.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah as our God and best Friend,

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will ‘delight
in the abundance of peace forever.’

01:05:44.275 --> 01:05:46.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers.

01:05:46.444 --> 01:05:49.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few things bring more joy to our heart

01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:53.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
than meditating on
what Jehovah is doing for us now

01:05:53.076 --> 01:05:56.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what he will do in the near future.

01:05:56.413 --> 01:06:00.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have so many rich blessings
to look forward to.

01:06:02.919 --> 01:06:06.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
How fitting it is
that we keep our focus

01:06:06.089 --> 01:06:09.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
on pleasing our loving heavenly Father!

01:06:09.259 --> 01:06:13.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus we invite you to sing song number 35,

01:06:13.138 --> 01:06:17.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “‘Make Sure
of the More Important Things’”

01:06:17.475 --> 01:06:19.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
—song number 35.

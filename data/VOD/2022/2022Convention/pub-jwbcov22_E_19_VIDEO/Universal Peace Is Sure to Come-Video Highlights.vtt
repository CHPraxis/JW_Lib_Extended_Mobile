Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:08.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:09.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:12.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she ever?

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:14.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:17.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels out of your control, doesn’t it?

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:22.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when we studied
about the Shulammite girl?

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:26.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was really in control?

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the same power.

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:35.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you believe that,
it’ll change how you handle the pressure.

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:39.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a wall.”

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:00:48.368 --> 00:00:49.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have hated him for it.

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:53.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he could have.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess he saw the jailer’s pain
instead of just his own.

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:01.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you just one scripture.

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:02.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, one scripture.

00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has taught us to love,

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:08.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given our family

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:18.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:25.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe her?

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:28.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t seen all her posts.

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:31.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Celia agrees that Haley
is doing something she shouldn’t,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should talk to her.

00:01:34.463 --> 00:01:35.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve noticed

00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:37.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
your posts lately on QuicPost.

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:39.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about them?

00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:41.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think you’re bragging.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would think like that?
You?

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:45.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to upset you.
Jake said that I needed to take . . .

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:48.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake! So everyone thinks
my posts are inappropriate?

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:50.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:51.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time

00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:59.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you wanted forgiveness.

00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:05.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.”

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not jealous.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, Haley.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine affection fights peace wreckers.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
And affection grows when we really know

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:19.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters well.

00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:24.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always impressed

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
with how close you two were.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t always that way.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:02:35.034 --> 00:02:38.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
What started as a small disagreement
just exploded.

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:40.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
You!
You’re the problem.

00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:45.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make things right with Nick.

00:02:47.757 --> 00:02:49.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a misunderstanding

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
that got blown all out of proportion.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t handle it the best.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when our peace
was really put to the test.

00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:03.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
The body decided, unanimously,
that he should no longer serve.

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:06.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you pushed them!

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil didn’t know just how tense things were
between Tim and I.

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:15.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort
in accounts of Jehovah’s servants.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me realize that 

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
being at peace with my brothers

00:03:19.627 --> 00:03:23.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important
than any appointed position.

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:27.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy,

00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:29.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we talked it out.

00:03:29.764 --> 00:03:32.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were able to make peace
with Jehovah’s help.

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:34.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without peace,

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:37.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how we could’ve managed
what was to come.

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment when you hear the verdict

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ll stay in prison,

00:03:45.032 --> 00:03:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like you’ve been knocked unconscious.

00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then

00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:54.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doors of the elevator opened up,

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:57.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in front of us . . .

00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:07.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Jehovah.

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:10.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just about to lose
all your strength,

00:04:10.478 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:18.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian brothers and sisters,
I pray for them constantly

00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:23.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are going
through a very tough time.

00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:33.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I’ve learned from all of this

00:04:33.713 --> 00:04:38.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace isn’t from what’s outside,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what’s going on,
or from what you’re experiencing.

00:04:41.472 --> 00:04:45.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that peace is on the inside,

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:49.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that comes from Jehovah.

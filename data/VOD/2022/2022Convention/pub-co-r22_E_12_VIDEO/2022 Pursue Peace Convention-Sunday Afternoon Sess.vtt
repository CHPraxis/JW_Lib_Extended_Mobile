00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:26.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each year, we look forward
to the high-quality video presentations

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have become
a highlight of our conventions.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work is underway
on videos and dramas for future conventions.

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
The set construction

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other work needed for the series

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:39.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
is well along.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, planning and construction
of our new media production facility

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States
is moving ahead steadily.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these efforts
are supported by voluntary donations.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you would like to have a share

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
in supporting the worldwide work
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
one way you can do so

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
is through your financial contributions.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.087 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have seen

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah promises us a future

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
filled with happiness and peace.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will universal peace come about,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what will it mean for mankind?

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention
to Brother Geoffrey Jackson,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he answers those questions
in the final talk of this convention,

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Universal Peace Is Sure to Come!”

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is true peace?

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who live in lands
where they have wars,

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt the focus they have on true peace

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to stop fighting, to stop the conflicts,

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
to not have any wars.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s true that peace
does include an absence of war.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:15.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in many cases, the efforts of mankind

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try and gain peace by stopping wars

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
is similar to what we say
is a Band-Aid solution.

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:25.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a person may have a horrible sore,

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even cancerous.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if he just puts a Band-Aid over the top,

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe it hides the sore,

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:40.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it really doesn’t solve the problem
—does it?—

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
because peace is not just an end of war.

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know yourself, if you were to live
in a country where there isn’t any war

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’re still worried about your health,

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
your well-being, and your safety

00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if you feel sick and hungry,

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you say that you’re having
a peaceful life?

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Bible, the word “peace”

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
means far more than just an absence of war.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means good health, well-being, and safety.

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from our convention, we’ve seen

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there’s a lot involved with true peace.

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:25.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes having
a peaceful relationship with Jehovah God.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also means having
a peaceful relationship with others.

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also it includes

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:37.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace of heart and mind
that gives us tranquility.

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now in this final talk,

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to consider a bigger issue,

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:48.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is universal peace.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we mean by universal peace?

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:56.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we mean by universal peace
is a type of peace

00:03:56.882 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is everywhere in heaven and on earth

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in all aspects of life.

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:08.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the type of peace that only the God
of peace, Jehovah, can bring

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the “Prince of Peace,”
Jesus Christ.

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon they will take dramatic steps

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:21.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take our Bibles,
and if we turn together

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Romans 16:20,

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see what’s included

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:32.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this restoration of universal peace

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s Romans 16:20.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re told: “For his part,

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God who gives peace will crush Satan

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:44.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“under your feet shortly.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:48.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
May the undeserved kindness
of our Lord Jesus be with you.”

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:54.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the restoration of universal peace
also includes

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
the crushing of Satan the Devil.

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:03.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in our final discussion,
the final talk of this convention,

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:07.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to consider four basic questions.

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is,

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:12.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was universal peace disturbed?

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:17.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, Who will restore universal peace?

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:21.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third question, How will it be restored?

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:25.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally, we’re going to think
about what further blessings

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
mankind will enjoy at that time.

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:32.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before we go on
to answer those questions,

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:36.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s review together
the program that we’ve had.

00:05:36.273 --> 00:05:40.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree that this has been
a beautiful convention.

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:44.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s encouraged us to pursue peace.

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:49.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are some of the good points
that you remember from the program?

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:54.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we mentioned already, there are
three aspects to peace that we’ll discuss.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:58.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, our peace with Jehovah God.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Friday program finished
with the final talk,

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:06.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s where it mentions
about not being misled

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:09.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
by imitation peace.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Sunday,
what a beautiful public discourse we had!

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said “Friendship With God—How Possible?”

00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:22.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the second aspect of our peace

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace with one another.

00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:27.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first day, remember,
we had that beautiful symposium

00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
on family peace.

00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the things
that we need to do

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have peace in our family?

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:37.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, love and respect are important.

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:41.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to improve
our communication with one another.

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:45.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to work as a team
and worship together.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Saturday, we had
another interesting symposium

00:06:48.762 --> 00:06:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what it said about peace wreckers,

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:54.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
things that can wreck peace.

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:56.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember some of those?

00:06:56.853 --> 00:06:59.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inappropriate boasting,

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:02.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
envy, dishonesty, harmful gossip,

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
and uncontrolled anger.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:09.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the third aspect of peace

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:11.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
deals with our personal peace,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
our inner calm despite trials.

00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Saturday, we had a very interesting talk

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:22.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
that mentioned the need
to safeguard our bond of peace.

00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then on Sunday, we went through
another symposium where it gave examples

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who had sowed peace
and then reaped peace.

00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:35.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we look through the program,
I’m sure there are so many points

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can remember that you enjoyed.

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:41.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, one of the highlights
at any convention

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:44.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when we have the baptism.

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:48.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were baptized at this convention,
we’d like to welcome you!

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:52.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we welcome you
to the Christian brotherhood

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:57.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know that you’re working hard
to have peace with Jehovah God.

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:02.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now at this point, let’s watch a video

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gives us some lessons
with regard to what we saw

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the various videos in this convention.

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:10.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy!

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:17.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:19.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:08:19.728 --> 00:08:20.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:22.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:08:22.022 --> 00:08:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she ever?

00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:25.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels out of your control, doesn’t it?

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:33.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when we studied
about the Shulammite girl?

00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:36.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was really in control?

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:41.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the same power.

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you believe that,
it’ll change how you handle the pressure.

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:50.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:53.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a wall.”

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:56.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:08:56.098 --> 00:08:58.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:00.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:02.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have hated him for it.

00:09:03.021 --> 00:09:04.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he could have.

00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess he saw the jailer’s pain
instead of just his own.

00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:11.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you just one scripture.

00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:13.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, one scripture.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:16.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has taught us to love,

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:19.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given our family

00:09:19.037 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace.

00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:27.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:29.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here.

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:31.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:32.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe her?

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:39.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t seen all her posts.

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Celia agrees that Haley
is doing something she shouldn’t,

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should talk to her.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve noticed

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
your posts lately on QuicPost.

00:09:48.692 --> 00:09:49.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about them?

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:51.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think you’re bragging.

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:54.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would think like that?
You?

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:56.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to upset you.
Jake said that I needed to take . . .

00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:59.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake! So everyone thinks
my posts are inappropriate?

00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:00.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:02.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:08.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time

00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:10.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you wanted forgiveness.

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:16.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.”

00:10:16.094 --> 00:10:18.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not jealous.

00:10:19.848 --> 00:10:21.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, Haley.

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:25.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine affection fights peace wreckers.

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
And affection grows when we really know

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:30.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters well.

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:34.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always impressed

00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:37.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
with how close you two were.

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:41.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t always that way.

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:44.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
What started as a small disagreement
just exploded.

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:51.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
You!
You’re the problem.

00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:57.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make things right with Nick.

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:00.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a misunderstanding

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:02.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
that got blown all out of proportion.

00:11:04.392 --> 00:11:07.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t handle it the best.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when our peace
was really put to the test.

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:14.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
The body decided, unanimously,
that he should no longer serve.

00:11:14.694 --> 00:11:16.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you pushed them!

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:21.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil didn’t know just how tense things were
between Tim and I.

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:25.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort
in accounts of Jehovah’s servants.

00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:27.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me realize that 

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
being at peace with my brothers

00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:34.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important
than any appointed position.

00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:38.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy,

00:11:38.176 --> 00:11:40.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we talked it out.

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:43.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were able to make peace
with Jehovah’s help.

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:45.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without peace,

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:48.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how we could’ve managed
what was to come.

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:53.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment when you hear the verdict

00:11:53.733 --> 00:11:55.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ll stay in prison,

00:11:55.777 --> 00:11:57.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like you’ve been knocked unconscious.

00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:02.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doors of the elevator opened up,

00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:07.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in front of us . . .

00:12:15.505 --> 00:12:17.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Jehovah.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just about to lose
all your strength,

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:24.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:12:26.182 --> 00:12:28.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian brothers and sisters,
I pray for them constantly

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:34.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are going
through a very tough time.

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:44.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I’ve learned from all of this

00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:48.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace isn’t from what’s outside,

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what’s going on,
or from what you’re experiencing.

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:56.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that peace is on the inside,

00:12:56.254 --> 00:13:00.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that comes from Jehovah.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
What priceless lessons those were!

00:13:10.602 --> 00:13:14.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, at this point, friends,
we’re going to turn our attention

00:13:14.272 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that bigger issue

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
—universal peace.

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the first question
we’re going to answer?

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:26.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was universal peace disturbed?

00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:31.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before mankind was created,

00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:35.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
universal peace existed for countless ages.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just like a beautiful pond of water

00:13:40.173 --> 00:13:44.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was undisturbed
—no ripples, mirrorlike in appearance.

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:48.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, there was
utmost harmony with Jehovah

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with all the spirit creatures.

00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:55.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then it’s just as if a rock was thrown

00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:57.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
into that beautiful pond

00:13:57.774 --> 00:14:00.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace started to be disturbed.

00:14:01.986 --> 00:14:04.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
When do you think that happened?

00:14:04.447 --> 00:14:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll find the answer to that question
by turning to the Bible,

00:14:08.785 --> 00:14:13.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this time, if we look at 1 John 3:8

00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:18.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s 1 John 3:8—

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:23.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the answer to the question,
When did the problem start?

00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:29.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re told: “The one who practices sin

00:14:29.264 --> 00:14:31.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“originates with the Devil,

00:14:31.808 --> 00:14:35.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the Devil has been sinning
from the beginning.

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:40.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this purpose the Son of God
was made manifest,

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:43.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
to break up the works of the Devil.”

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice the answer to the question.

00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:50.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because the Devil has been sinning
from the beginning,”

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:54.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
or, as the footnote says,
‘from the time that he began.’

00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:59.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean right from the very time
when he was created?

00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:02.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he wasn’t the Devil then, was he?

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:04.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a perfect angel.

00:15:04.632 --> 00:15:06.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when was it

00:15:06.634 --> 00:15:10.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this universal peace
started to be disturbed?

00:15:10.555 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was it that the ripples
started to go through the universe?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you might remember

00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:21.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it wasn’t at the time
that he deceived Eve.

00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:26.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a little bit like when the Bible says
a woman gives birth to a child,

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s not when the child’s life starts,
is it?

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:31.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
It starts well before then.

00:15:31.493 --> 00:15:36.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
So likewise, this disruption
of the universal peace

00:15:36.289 --> 00:15:38.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
began in heaven first,

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:42.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the time that the angel who became Satan

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:45.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to covet the position of Jehovah

00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:47.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
to want worship from others.

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:52.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by doing this,
he alienated himself from God

00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:56.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no longer was he in harmony
with Jehovah’s will.

00:15:56.184 --> 00:15:59.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then that sinful attitude

00:15:59.103 --> 00:16:02.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
was manifested in the garden of Eden.

00:16:02.774 --> 00:16:04.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when he took the next step

00:16:04.943 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started to disturb the peace
of Adam and Eve

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:12.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course,
they lost their peace with God.

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:14.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s take a moment and think

00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:18.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what was really involved

00:16:18.164 --> 00:16:21.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those events
there in the garden of Eden.

00:16:21.876 --> 00:16:26.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some very important issues were raised.

00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:30.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember how Satan, first of all,
spoke to Eve?

00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:35.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
He asked what seemed
like a ridiculous question: ‘Is it true

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:39.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that God hasn’t allowed you to eat
from any tree in the garden?

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the trees are banned?’

00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:43.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, that’s ridiculous.

00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:46.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was he doing?

00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:51.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was calling into question
Jehovah’s qualities.

00:16:51.197 --> 00:16:54.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he was inferring
that Jehovah may not be so generous.

00:16:54.993 --> 00:16:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe he’s stingy.

00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps he’s holding things back
from Adam and Eve

00:16:59.747 --> 00:17:02.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they really should have.

00:17:02.584 --> 00:17:06.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Satan went one step further.

00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:11.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “You . . . will not die.”

00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:16.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really what he was saying is,
‘Jehovah is a liar.’

00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:20.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a horrible accusation!

00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:24.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Eve didn’t defend Jehovah.

00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would have expected
that she would have said to Satan:

00:17:27.942 --> 00:17:31.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Who are you? I don’t know you.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why would I believe you?

00:17:33.072 --> 00:17:36.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know my loving heavenly Father, Jehovah.’

00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:40.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no, she sided with the Devil.

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:44.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would Jehovah do?

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think for a moment about this:

00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:51.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if someone accused you wrongly
in front of everybody,

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:56.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
calling you a liar,
saying all sorts of bad things about you?

00:17:56.054 --> 00:17:58.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you do?

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:00.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you go and punch them in the face?

00:18:00.975 --> 00:18:03.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you did, that wouldn’t be
the right thing to do

00:18:03.728 --> 00:18:08.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it certainly wouldn’t answer
the questions raised.

00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:13.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, was that person really true
in what they said or not?

00:18:13.154 --> 00:18:16.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you probably solve this?

00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you might take the person to court.

00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:22.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that court case, that person

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:26.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
could offer whatever evidence they feel
they have to prove that you’re a liar.

00:18:26.626 --> 00:18:30.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
you can produce witnesses to prove

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really you aren’t a liar,
but you’re very truthful.

00:18:35.218 --> 00:18:38.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally, there would be
a decision made

00:18:38.262 --> 00:18:41.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to who was right and who was wrong.

00:18:41.474 --> 00:18:43.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:47.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
these issues (these questions)
raised in the garden of Eden

00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:50.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
started a symbolic court case.

00:18:50.566 --> 00:18:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jehovah respond?

00:18:53.277 --> 00:18:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wisely, he allowed time

00:18:56.572 --> 00:18:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
to settle these issues.

00:18:58.908 --> 00:19:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed Satan the opportunity

00:19:01.744 --> 00:19:06.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try and rule mankind to do things his way.

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:11.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time, mercifully,
he provided the hope

00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the unborn children of Adam and Eve.

00:19:15.758 --> 00:19:19.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember at Genesis 3:15,

00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:23.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
it speaks of an “offspring,” or a Son,
who’d come later

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:25.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually undo the bad

00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:29.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan had done there in the beginning

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:32.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually free mankind
from sin and death.

00:19:33.735 --> 00:19:35.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what has Satan been doing

00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:38.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
since this opportunity has been given to him?

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s still craving worship from other people.

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:46.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants them to bow down to him
and acknowledge him as their god.

00:19:46.456 --> 00:19:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also uses lies and deceit

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:52.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘blind the minds’ of persons.

00:19:52.503 --> 00:19:56.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he also has great anger,
particularly at this time in history,

00:19:56.841 --> 00:19:59.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he knows his end is near.

00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:02.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he’s influencing the world to hate

00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:06.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
anyone who stands up on Jehovah’s side.

00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:11.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s think
about a very interesting question:

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:13.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we’re living

00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:16.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a world that is ruled by Satan,

00:20:16.694 --> 00:20:19.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
is it possible at all

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to have a measure of peace with God?

00:20:22.742 --> 00:20:26.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re experiencing
so many trials and challenges.

00:20:26.204 --> 00:20:27.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
We face opposition.

00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:31.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have illness, economic problems,
disasters.

00:20:31.876 --> 00:20:36.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it possible to have some measure of peace?

00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is found again in the Scriptures,

00:20:38.925 --> 00:20:41.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this time, if you turn with me, please,

00:20:41.469 --> 00:20:46.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 1

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:51.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Second Corinthians 1:3, 4—

00:20:52.897 --> 00:20:55.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice this beautiful promise:

00:20:56.651 --> 00:21:01.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Praised be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:01.197 --> 00:21:04.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Father of tender mercies

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the God of all comfort,

00:21:07.328 --> 00:21:10.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials

00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:15.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may be able to comfort others
in any sort of trial

00:21:15.378 --> 00:21:19.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the comfort that we receive from God.”

00:21:19.382 --> 00:21:22.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful scripture?

00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:23.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it highlight?

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:28.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, Jehovah obviously is aware
of our suffering.

00:21:28.724 --> 00:21:32.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
He feels for us.
He wants to help us.

00:21:32.728 --> 00:21:36.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentions he’s
“the Father of tender mercies.”

00:21:36.399 --> 00:21:39.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the same time, we realize

00:21:39.026 --> 00:21:43.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah won’t step in
and fix all our problems at this point.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:46.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because this is the time that Satan

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:49.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the opportunity
to try and rule the world,

00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:54.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the problems of this world
really come from Satan.

00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:58.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,
we wouldn’t expect Jehovah to step in

00:21:58.838 --> 00:22:03.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start to solve the problems
as if he were helping Satan the Devil.

00:22:04.552 --> 00:22:09.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is a time
when Satan will be taken away

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the problems will be solved.

00:22:12.351 --> 00:22:16.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could think of Jehovah’s position
as similar to that of a father

00:22:16.397 --> 00:22:20.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose son is running in a marathon race.

00:22:20.484 --> 00:22:23.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he sees his son running in the race,

00:22:23.905 --> 00:22:27.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
he may see his son is starting to tire out.

00:22:27.074 --> 00:22:31.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps you may see that others
in the race are not obeying the rules.

00:22:31.245 --> 00:22:35.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean that the father then jumps in
and takes the place of his son

00:22:35.541 --> 00:22:38.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helps him as he runs along?

00:22:38.252 --> 00:22:40.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the rules don’t allow it.

00:22:40.796 --> 00:22:44.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what the father can do
is continue to encourage his son:

00:22:44.383 --> 00:22:48.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on going.
Yes, you can do it!”

00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:52.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in a similar way,
what does this verse tell us?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said that Jehovah gives us comfort.

00:22:56.687 --> 00:22:58.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do that?

00:22:58.689 --> 00:23:02.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives us peace
by means of his Word, the Bible;

00:23:02.193 --> 00:23:04.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of holy spirit;

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:07.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by the loving brotherhood that we have.

00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:13.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this point, what we’d like to do
is have a look at a video that will highlight

00:23:13.871 --> 00:23:18.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah lovingly helps us
even in times of need.

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:25.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are living

00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:28.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
in “critical times

00:23:28.552 --> 00:23:30.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
hard to deal with.”

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:35.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people have lost all hope,

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and servants of Jehovah

00:23:38.938 --> 00:23:41.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not free from trials.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may face loss of property,

00:23:46.862 --> 00:23:49.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of health,

00:23:50.616 --> 00:23:53.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of loved ones.

00:23:56.038 --> 00:23:59.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience deep emotional trauma

00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:05.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even imprisonment for our faith.

00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:13.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our trials are similar to those of Job,

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:15.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:19.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was so saddened that he once asked,

00:24:19.562 --> 00:24:22.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why didn’t I die at birth?’

00:24:24.483 --> 00:24:28.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we’ve had moments like that.

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:31.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why should we not lose hope?

00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:39.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because with every trial
comes Jehovah’s support

00:24:39.874 --> 00:24:43.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
—support received in many forms:

00:24:44.378 --> 00:24:46.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
material support,

00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional support,

00:25:19.663 --> 00:25:21.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual support.

00:25:33.386 --> 00:25:35.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while Jehovah

00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:37.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not remove all our trials now,

00:25:38.808 --> 00:25:41.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust that with his support,

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:44.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can endure them

00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:50.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they disappear
in “the real life” to come.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 34:17, 18 says:

00:25:54.824 --> 00:25:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They cried out, and Jehovah heard . . .

00:25:58.494 --> 00:26:02.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:26:06.252 --> 00:26:09.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can see that even though
our peace has been disturbed,

00:26:09.922 --> 00:26:13.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can enjoy peace with God.

00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:16.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about our second question.

00:26:16.887 --> 00:26:18.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, that question was,

00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:22.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who will restore universal peace?

00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:24.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we already saw the answer

00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we referred to Genesis 3:15,

00:26:28.524 --> 00:26:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first prophecy in the Bible.

00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:33.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentioned the promised offspring, or Son,

00:26:33.946 --> 00:26:37.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that one is Jesus Christ
—the Prince of Peace.

00:26:37.867 --> 00:26:39.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has the key role

00:26:39.994 --> 00:26:43.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
in restoring universal peace.

00:26:43.414 --> 00:26:45.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very soon,

00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:49.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s going to take the decisive action
to remove this old world

00:26:49.795 --> 00:26:52.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take progressive steps

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why can we be so sure

00:27:00.264 --> 00:27:03.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will come soon?

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a very simple answer

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:10.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
—by seeing the current events
that are happening in the world today.

00:27:10.065 --> 00:27:12.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as we look around us,

00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:15.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see so many things that are happening

00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:17.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
that proves to us

00:27:17.364 --> 00:27:21.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will soon step in to help us.

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:23.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can we say that?

00:27:23.621 --> 00:27:25.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s have a look together

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:30.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the famous prophecy
that’s recorded in Matthew chapter 24

00:27:32.004 --> 00:27:36.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 24:3.

00:27:36.675 --> 00:27:40.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the apostles
at this particular time

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:44.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
were asking Jesus a very important question.

00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at the second part of verse 3.

00:27:48.604 --> 00:27:51.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says they asked: “Tell us,

00:27:51.774 --> 00:27:54.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when will these things be,

00:27:54.443 --> 00:27:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what will be the sign of your presence

00:27:57.279 --> 00:28:00.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of the conclusion
of the system of things?”

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:05.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you remember, no doubt
from your previous studies of the Bible,

00:28:05.996 --> 00:28:09.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jesus then went on to list
many events that would occur

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:12.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the last days.

00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:14.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
He mentioned wars;

00:28:14.171 --> 00:28:17.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
he mentioned earthquakes;
he mentioned famines

00:28:17.758 --> 00:28:20.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all sorts of pestilences.

00:28:21.428 --> 00:28:26.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly we have seen those things happen
in recent times.

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:29.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to all of that, Matthew 24:14

00:28:29.645 --> 00:28:33.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned the need to preach
the “good news of the Kingdom.”

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there could be some who
perhaps may doubt a little

00:28:39.196 --> 00:28:43.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say: ‘Well, there’s been wars
all through time.

00:28:43.158 --> 00:28:47.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There’s been earthquakes at other times,
not just in the last days,

00:28:47.746 --> 00:28:49.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and food shortages.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So why can we be so sure

00:28:52.793 --> 00:28:55.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that this is the time

00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:58.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when we know that Jesus
will soon bring about

00:28:58.757 --> 00:29:01.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
an end to wickedness?’

00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:04.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s use an illustration.

00:29:04.138 --> 00:29:07.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us are familiar
with using a computer.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you sit at your computer,

00:29:10.936 --> 00:29:15.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the first thing that you need to do
after you’ve turned it on?

00:29:15.524 --> 00:29:19.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually, you have to type in a password,
don’t you?

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you have to get it right.

00:29:21.322 --> 00:29:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to put in all those numbers
and letters that are required.

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:30.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you won’t be able
to start working on the computer.

00:29:30.664 --> 00:29:34.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these days people are very concerned

00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:36.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
about having strong passwords.

00:29:38.297 --> 00:29:40.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think if you had a password

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:44.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had 24 different letters and numbers?

00:29:44.762 --> 00:29:47.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a very strong password,

00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it would be very difficult for someone

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:54.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just randomly try and find out
what those numbers are

00:29:54.104 --> 00:29:56.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unlock your computer.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does that relate
to the sign that Jesus gave?

00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:05.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that if you look back at Matthew 24:3,

00:30:05.282 --> 00:30:09.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
the question was not
the “signs” of your presence

00:30:09.703 --> 00:30:11.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the “sign.”

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like a password—one sign.

00:30:15.584 --> 00:30:19.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then that sign
has many different features

00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:23.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in fact, at least 24 different features.

00:30:24.927 --> 00:30:28.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though there have been wars
in the past,

00:30:28.347 --> 00:30:30.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the time when we see

00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those features
coming together at one time.

00:30:34.103 --> 00:30:37.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that way, we could say
it opens the fulfillment

00:30:37.731 --> 00:30:40.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Bible prophecy.

00:30:40.067 --> 00:30:44.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as we look around us,
as we listen to the news each day,

00:30:44.446 --> 00:30:48.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see
that there is a definite fulfillment

00:30:48.075 --> 00:30:50.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what Jesus said.

00:30:50.077 --> 00:30:53.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, the end is close.

00:30:53.163 --> 00:30:57.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just like a jigsaw puzzle,
to use another illustration.

00:30:57.042 --> 00:30:59.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you have all the pieces
of a jigsaw puzzle

00:30:59.753 --> 00:31:01.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you start to put them all together,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
eventually when all the pieces are in place,

00:31:05.134 --> 00:31:07.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
the picture is clear, isn’t it?

00:31:07.302 --> 00:31:11.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly how we should feel

00:31:11.056 --> 00:31:14.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the prophecy that Jesus gave.

00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:19.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, very soon,
he is going to step in and take action.

00:31:20.357 --> 00:31:23.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, sometimes we may feel,

00:31:23.235 --> 00:31:26.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yes, we’ve known about this
for quite some time.’

00:31:26.947 --> 00:31:31.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it means that we’ve had to wait
a long time.

00:31:31.952 --> 00:31:34.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that doesn’t negate the fact

00:31:34.413 --> 00:31:38.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the evidence of the last days is here.

00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:40.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could illustrate it this way:

00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:43.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us have gone to an airport

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet someone
who’s coming maybe from overseas

00:31:46.341 --> 00:31:48.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
or another part of the country.

00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:52.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, since 9/11,
it’s very hard to go to an airport

00:31:52.848 --> 00:31:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and actually stand on the side of the runway
and see the plane land.

00:31:57.853 --> 00:31:59.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually, what happens?

00:31:59.855 --> 00:32:04.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once you get to the airport, you’re allowed
to go into a large room with other people,

00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:07.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all you see are monitors on the wall.

00:32:07.863 --> 00:32:11.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what may the monitors say?

00:32:11.116 --> 00:32:15.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you see, it says there
that the flight has left.

00:32:15.245 --> 00:32:20.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then later, maybe the monitor says
the flight is on time.

00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:23.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it says the flight has landed.

00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:27.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it says the flight is taxiing.

00:32:27.508 --> 00:32:29.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it says it’s at the gate.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now you start to get really excited,
don’t you?

00:32:33.222 --> 00:32:37.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet you haven’t seen the plane,
and you haven’t seen your friend yet.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you can see from the indications

00:32:40.771 --> 00:32:42.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what you see on the monitor

00:32:42.856 --> 00:32:44.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it must be close.

00:32:44.942 --> 00:32:48.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then all of a sudden, the doors open
and people start to come out.

00:32:48.821 --> 00:32:51.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now you’re really excited
because you know,

00:32:51.323 --> 00:32:54.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, you’re going to meet your friend.

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:58.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that is similar
to how we can view the last days.

00:32:58.997 --> 00:33:02.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
There has been a lot of things happening
that we don’t actually see.

00:33:02.292 --> 00:33:05.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we see the indications
of what’s happened.

00:33:05.838 --> 00:33:08.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that very soon

00:33:08.423 --> 00:33:12.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, the angels, and the 144,000

00:33:12.886 --> 00:33:16.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
will take steps to remove this old world

00:33:16.056 --> 00:33:18.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take further steps

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the restoration of peace.

00:33:21.353 --> 00:33:23.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful promise?

00:33:25.065 --> 00:33:28.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
So naturally, that takes us
to the third question:

00:33:28.735 --> 00:33:32.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will universal peace be restored?

00:33:32.823 --> 00:33:36.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will Jesus need to do?

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:40.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, we could say
there are two actions required.

00:33:40.873 --> 00:33:44.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
One is to remove Satan

00:33:44.084 --> 00:33:46.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the peace disturbers.

00:33:46.712 --> 00:33:49.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the second action

00:33:49.214 --> 00:33:53.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to undo all the evil that Satan has done.

00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:58.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we don’t want a Band-Aid solution
—do we?—

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you’re just hiding something
that’s very serious

00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:04.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
by putting a Band-Aid over it.

00:34:04.396 --> 00:34:07.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
So not only does Jesus need to take away

00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:09.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
those that are disrupting the peace,

00:34:09.818 --> 00:34:11.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also has to take steps

00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:15.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
to heal mankind and to heal the earth

00:34:15.532 --> 00:34:19.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that all the evil, the bad things
that Satan has done,

00:34:19.411 --> 00:34:21.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be overturned.

00:34:21.622 --> 00:34:25.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about those two actions
for a moment.

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:30.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the first one
is to remove the peace disturbers.

00:34:30.172 --> 00:34:33.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
What steps are involved with that?

00:34:33.133 --> 00:34:37.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, this is a progressive action.

00:34:37.304 --> 00:34:41.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we take our Bibles
and turn to the book of Revelation,

00:34:41.433 --> 00:34:46.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see there are several things
mentioned here that help us to see

00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:50.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
how progressively Jesus
has and will bring about

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:54.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
this removal of peace disturbers.

00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:58.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to Revelation chapter 12,

00:34:58.325 --> 00:35:00.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s read together verse 9

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation 12.

00:35:03.872 --> 00:35:06.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, immediately, no doubt you remember

00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:09.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Revelation 12
is talking about the time

00:35:09.795 --> 00:35:14.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus’ government, his Kingdom,
was established in the heavens.

00:35:14.174 --> 00:35:17.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was in 1914.

00:35:17.302 --> 00:35:19.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 9, it mentions

00:35:19.346 --> 00:35:23.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened shortly after that time.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it:

00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:28.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So down the great dragon was hurled,

00:35:28.313 --> 00:35:32.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the original serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan,

00:35:32.442 --> 00:35:36.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth;

00:35:36.113 --> 00:35:38.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was hurled down to the earth,

00:35:38.407 --> 00:35:41.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his angels were hurled down with him.”

00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:45.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that word
that came up several times

00:35:45.747 --> 00:35:47.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“hurled” down?

00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:52.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Jesus didn’t go and say to Satan:
‘Well, look, if you don’t mind,

00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:55.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we’d like you to relocate to the earth.

00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:57.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever you’re ready.’

00:35:57.884 --> 00:36:00.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Satan was hurled down.

00:36:00.637 --> 00:36:02.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what confidence that gives us!

00:36:02.848 --> 00:36:05.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that Jesus has the power

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to remove Satan from the heavens.

00:36:08.729 --> 00:36:11.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gives us some idea
of what’s going to happen in the future

00:36:11.773 --> 00:36:14.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the earth.

00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:17.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, now we’re living in a time
when Satan and his demons

00:36:17.654 --> 00:36:20.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
are here in the vicinity of the earth,

00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:23.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are causing so much trouble.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s another step that Jesus will take

00:36:26.913 --> 00:36:30.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
in removing those who disrupt the peace?

00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:34.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at another chapter
in the same book,

00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:36.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation chapter 19

00:36:38.008 --> 00:36:40.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 19.

00:36:40.677 --> 00:36:45.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to read starting at verse 19
right through to 21.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might mention before we start reading it

00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:54.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
that here it describes
political organizations, kings,

00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:58.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who oppose
Jesus and Jehovah God.

00:36:58.945 --> 00:37:02.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in a symbolic way,
it refers to these as beasts,

00:37:02.699 --> 00:37:04.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
as organizations,

00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:07.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have disrupted the peace.

00:37:07.496 --> 00:37:09.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what happens to them:

00:37:09.915 --> 00:37:14.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw the wild beast
and the kings of the earth and their armies

00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:19.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“gathered together to wage war
against the one seated on the horse

00:37:19.216 --> 00:37:24.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and against his army
[now, that one is Jesus Christ].

00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:26.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the wild beast was caught,

00:37:26.723 --> 00:37:29.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and along with it the false prophet

00:37:29.142 --> 00:37:31.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that performed in front of it the signs

00:37:31.978 --> 00:37:36.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with which he misled those who received
the mark of the wild beast

00:37:36.566 --> 00:37:39.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those who worship its image.

00:37:39.236 --> 00:37:41.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“While still alive,

00:37:41.321 --> 00:37:44.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they both were hurled into the fiery lake

00:37:44.616 --> 00:37:46.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
that burns with sulfur.”

00:37:46.952 --> 00:37:50.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what happens
to these political organizations

00:37:50.205 --> 00:37:53.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
in opposition to Jehovah and Jesus?

00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:57.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we see the word
“hurled” down into destruction.

00:37:57.879 --> 00:38:00.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the rest of mankind

00:38:00.423 --> 00:38:03.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
that opposes Jesus’ rule?

00:38:03.009 --> 00:38:05.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at verse 21.

00:38:05.846 --> 00:38:07.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

00:38:07.514 --> 00:38:09.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the rest were killed off

00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:12.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the long sword
that proceeded out of the mouth

00:38:12.394 --> 00:38:14.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the one seated on the horse.

00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:19.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all the birds
were filled with their flesh.”

00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:23.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a very interesting comment,
isn’t it?

00:38:23.029 --> 00:38:26.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to see here

00:38:26.116 --> 00:38:30.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all those who oppose Jesus

00:38:30.662 --> 00:38:34.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be destroyed
in the battle of Armageddon.

00:38:34.624 --> 00:38:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s another step

00:38:36.626 --> 00:38:40.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
in getting ready for universal peace.

00:38:40.255 --> 00:38:43.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, Satan is cast out of heaven.

00:38:43.675 --> 00:38:46.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then secondly, at Armageddon,

00:38:46.136 --> 00:38:49.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those humans who rebelled against Jesus

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reject his rule

00:38:52.184 --> 00:38:55.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be taken away, destroyed.

00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:56.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s something else too.

00:38:56.897 --> 00:39:00.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at chapter 20 of Revelation

00:39:00.317 --> 00:39:03.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 20 and verses 1-3:

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw an angel coming down
out of heaven with the key of the abyss

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:12.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a great chain in his hand.

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:16.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He seized the dragon, the original serpent,

00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:18.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is the Devil and Satan,

00:39:18.168 --> 00:39:21.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bound him for 1,000 years.

00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:25.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he [notice the word again]
hurled him into the abyss

00:39:25.217 --> 00:39:27.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and shut it and sealed it over him,

00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:31.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that he would not mislead
the nations anymore

00:39:31.681 --> 00:39:34.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until the 1,000 years were ended.

00:39:34.559 --> 00:39:38.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
After this he must be released
for a little while.”

00:39:40.106 --> 00:39:44.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we notice from this description?

00:39:44.027 --> 00:39:47.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, gradually, in a progressive manner,

00:39:47.614 --> 00:39:51.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will eradicate and remove

00:39:51.034 --> 00:39:54.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who disrupt peace.

00:39:54.871 --> 00:39:58.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Satan and his demons
are cast down to the earth.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the battle of Armageddon,
those who rebelled will be destroyed.

00:40:03.338 --> 00:40:05.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Satan will be put

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a symbolic prison, in this abyss,

00:40:08.885 --> 00:40:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 1,000 years along with his demons.

00:40:12.555 --> 00:40:16.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the first action
that Jesus needs to do

00:40:16.768 --> 00:40:19.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to get rid of these troublemakers.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:23.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
That opens up the way
for what the Bible refers to

00:40:23.608 --> 00:40:27.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ

00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:30.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his Kingdom and corulers.

00:40:31.616 --> 00:40:33.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is going to happen

00:40:33.785 --> 00:40:36.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
during that Thousand Year Reign?

00:40:36.997 --> 00:40:41.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember we said that it’s not
a Band-Aid-type solution, is it?

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will need to help

00:40:44.045 --> 00:40:47.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
mankind and the earth to heal.

00:40:47.882 --> 00:40:51.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, please, how this is described for us

00:40:51.094 --> 00:40:53.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a scripture that we’ve already read.

00:40:53.847 --> 00:40:58.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to it again—1 John 3:8.

00:40:59.936 --> 00:41:02.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember in the beginning of that verse,

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s where it told us how universal peace

00:41:05.567 --> 00:41:07.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
was disrupted in the beginning,

00:41:07.736 --> 00:41:09.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the time when that angel

00:41:09.946 --> 00:41:13.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the Devil and started sinning.

00:41:13.616 --> 00:41:18.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what it says
in the second part of this verse:

00:41:18.913 --> 00:41:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this purpose

00:41:21.124 --> 00:41:25.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Son of God was made manifest,
[to do what?]

00:41:25.253 --> 00:41:29.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
to break up [or to destroy]
the works of the Devil.”

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that an amazing concept?

00:41:34.346 --> 00:41:38.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus not only removes
those who disrupt peace,

00:41:38.266 --> 00:41:41.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he will “break up
the works of the Devil,”

00:41:41.561 --> 00:41:45.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things that he’s done
over these thousands of years

00:41:45.023 --> 00:41:47.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s been ruling this earth.

00:41:47.275 --> 00:41:49.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means all the evil,

00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:52.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the suffering, death,

00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:55.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of that will be taken away.

00:41:55.867 --> 00:41:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mankind will be gradually healed.

00:41:59.162 --> 00:42:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus started to break up
the works of the Devil

00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he willingly gave his life as a ransom.

00:42:07.212 --> 00:42:10.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even now we have the opportunity

00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:14.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain a measure of peace
with Jehovah and with others.

00:42:14.302 --> 00:42:16.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can ask Jehovah for forgiveness

00:42:16.763 --> 00:42:19.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the ransom sacrifice.

00:42:19.933 --> 00:42:23.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during the Thousand Year Reign,

00:42:23.019 --> 00:42:27.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be further things
that Jesus will accomplish.

00:42:27.357 --> 00:42:30.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice these three aspects:

00:42:30.944 --> 00:42:35.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will undo all harm.

00:42:35.073 --> 00:42:37.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that includes sickness, war,

00:42:37.784 --> 00:42:40.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
disease, famine, all these problems;

00:42:40.578 --> 00:42:43.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the harm will be undone.

00:42:43.957 --> 00:42:47.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will also undo death

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
by resurrecting those who have died.

00:42:50.839 --> 00:42:55.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he will also undo sin

00:42:55.093 --> 00:42:58.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping mankind to grow to perfection.

00:42:58.972 --> 00:43:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful promise,

00:43:01.224 --> 00:43:04.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
undoing all these works of the Devil?

00:43:04.936 --> 00:43:07.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then by the end of the thousand years,

00:43:07.856 --> 00:43:11.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will we see with regard to the earth?

00:43:11.317 --> 00:43:13.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be a paradise.

00:43:13.987 --> 00:43:16.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be exactly

00:43:16.156 --> 00:43:19.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah purposed it to be
in the beginning.

00:43:19.367 --> 00:43:22.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus, by means of the Kingdom,

00:43:22.996 --> 00:43:27.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have completely broken up
the works of the Devil.

00:43:28.168 --> 00:43:30.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, is that the time then

00:43:30.295 --> 00:43:33.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
when universal peace is restored?

00:43:33.673 --> 00:43:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not quite yet.

00:43:36.885 --> 00:43:37.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:43:37.969 --> 00:43:40.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else has to happen.

00:43:40.138 --> 00:43:44.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to reread another scripture,
and that’s Romans 16.

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:47.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember we referred to that
in the beginning.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we see a very interesting connection

00:43:51.191 --> 00:43:53.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
between two different things.

00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:56.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s Romans 16:20:

00:43:57.822 --> 00:44:01.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For his part, the God who gives peace

00:44:01.618 --> 00:44:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[will do what?]

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
will crush Satan under your feet shortly.”

00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:11.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the connection here?

00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:14.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Universal peace is connected

00:44:14.464 --> 00:44:18.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the crushing of Satan the Devil.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
So universal peace can only be restored

00:44:22.013 --> 00:44:25.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Satan has been destroyed.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:30.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what events will occur
leading up to Satan’s destruction?

00:44:30.605 --> 00:44:33.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember,
as we read already in Revelation,

00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:35.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is going to be allowed

00:44:35.693 --> 00:44:39.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be released from that prison
(the symbolic prison),

00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:42.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll have an opportunity
to try to mislead

00:44:42.867 --> 00:44:46.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who are living on the earth
at that time.

00:44:46.371 --> 00:44:51.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who join Satan
will be destroyed forever.

00:44:51.084 --> 00:44:56.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Satan will be permanently destroyed.

00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:59.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what will happen to those perfect persons

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
who prove faithful to Jehovah?

00:45:02.053 --> 00:45:04.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what the Bible says

00:45:04.055 --> 00:45:07.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we turn to the book of Romans,

00:45:07.725 --> 00:45:11.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 8:21

00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:15.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 8:21:

00:45:16.943 --> 00:45:19.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That the creation itself

00:45:19.404 --> 00:45:23.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will also be set free
from enslavement to corruption

00:45:23.408 --> 00:45:26.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and have the glorious freedom

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the children of God.”

00:45:28.538 --> 00:45:30.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that really mean?

00:45:30.873 --> 00:45:34.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that at that point,

00:45:34.252 --> 00:45:38.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone will become part
of Jehovah’s universal family.

00:45:38.923 --> 00:45:42.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
All intelligent creatures
in heaven and on earth

00:45:42.427 --> 00:45:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be united as one family

00:45:45.388 --> 00:45:49.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the pure worship
of the one true God, Jehovah.

00:45:49.559 --> 00:45:53.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful time that will be!

00:45:53.354 --> 00:45:57.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what further blessings
are involved with this process

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:01.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
of gradually bringing universal peace?

00:46:01.154 --> 00:46:03.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, during the Thousand Year Reign
of Jesus,

00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:07.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s going to be wonderful blessings.

00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:10.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who are obedient
to Jehovah and Jesus

00:46:10.872 --> 00:46:13.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
will experience the things
that were described

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:17.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible book of Psalms, in Psalm 72.

00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:19.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn there together

00:46:19.213 --> 00:46:22.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 72.

00:46:22.258 --> 00:46:25.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we see portrayed

00:46:25.386 --> 00:46:29.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
some very interesting prophetic statements

00:46:29.015 --> 00:46:31.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Thousand Year Reign.

00:46:31.142 --> 00:46:34.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll notice at the beginning,
it says regarding Solomon—

00:46:34.395 --> 00:46:38.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
So although initially
this was referring to an extent

00:46:38.274 --> 00:46:40.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to Solomon,

00:46:40.318 --> 00:46:43.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus mentioned
that he’s greater than Solomon.

00:46:43.613 --> 00:46:46.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this has a prophetic application

00:46:46.616 --> 00:46:48.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Thousand Year Reign.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what it says about peace.

00:46:51.663 --> 00:46:53.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in verse 1,

00:46:53.998 --> 00:46:56.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll go through to verse 4:

00:46:56.501 --> 00:47:00.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O God, give your judgments to the king,

00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:04.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and endow the son of the king
with your righteousness.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May he plead the cause of your people
with righteousness,

00:47:08.554 --> 00:47:11.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of your lowly ones with justice.

00:47:11.974 --> 00:47:15.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the mountains bring peace to the people,

00:47:15.186 --> 00:47:18.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and may the hills bring righteousness.

00:47:18.648 --> 00:47:21.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let him defend the lowly among the people,

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:23.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let him save the sons of the poor,

00:47:23.903 --> 00:47:26.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let him crush the defrauder.”

00:47:27.573 --> 00:47:29.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful description

00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:33.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what will happen
in the Thousand Year Reign!

00:47:33.037 --> 00:47:36.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, all those under Satan’s rule

00:47:36.749 --> 00:47:40.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were lowly, beaten up, disadvantaged

00:47:40.712 --> 00:47:43.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all these will experience relief

00:47:43.965 --> 00:47:47.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the righteous rule
of Jesus Christ.

00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:52.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go down a little further
to verses 12 through 14.

00:47:52.432 --> 00:47:56.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us a little more
about what Jesus will accomplish.

00:47:56.728 --> 00:47:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in verse 12, we’re told:

00:47:59.689 --> 00:48:03.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he will rescue the poor
who cry for help,

00:48:03.151 --> 00:48:07.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also the lowly one
and whoever has no helper.

00:48:07.572 --> 00:48:10.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will have pity on the lowly and the poor,

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the lives of the poor he will save.

00:48:13.995 --> 00:48:18.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From oppression and from violence
he will rescue them,

00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:21.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and notice
this very interesting expression]

00:48:21.711 --> 00:48:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their blood will be
precious in his eyes.”

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:28.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:33.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their blood will be precious in his eyes.”

00:48:33.055 --> 00:48:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible, usually the word “blood”

00:48:35.391 --> 00:48:38.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
is associated with life, isn’t it?

00:48:38.144 --> 00:48:42.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s saying that each person’s life

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be precious to Jesus Christ.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful description

00:48:48.237 --> 00:48:52.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what will happen
during the Thousand Year Reign!

00:48:52.116 --> 00:48:55.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then if we go back a little to verse 5,

00:48:55.912 --> 00:49:00.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll notice that this part of the psalm
helps us to see

00:49:00.124 --> 00:49:03.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
how widespread peace will be at that point.

00:49:03.419 --> 00:49:06.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
It uses very picturesque language.

00:49:06.672 --> 00:49:09.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice there in verse 5, it says:

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will fear you
as long as there is a sun

00:49:12.637 --> 00:49:16.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[well, we know the sun continues on,
so they’ll continue to fear him]

00:49:16.682 --> 00:49:19.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and as long as the moon remains,

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for generation after generation.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will be like the rain
that falls on the mown grass,

00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:29.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like showers of rain that water the earth.

00:49:29.695 --> 00:49:33.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In his days the righteous will flourish,

00:49:33.282 --> 00:49:37.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and peace will abound
until the moon is no more.

00:49:37.245 --> 00:49:41.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will have subjects from sea to sea

00:49:41.415 --> 00:49:45.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the River to the ends of the earth.”

00:49:45.586 --> 00:49:49.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, what a beautiful description

00:49:49.257 --> 00:49:52.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the peaceful arrangements
that will prevail

00:49:52.969 --> 00:49:57.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Thousand Year Reign
of Jesus’ Kingdom!

00:49:58.432 --> 00:50:02.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the thousand years finishes.

00:50:03.479 --> 00:50:07.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we expect when that reign ends?

00:50:07.692 --> 00:50:10.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’re going to enjoy
our consideration

00:50:10.778 --> 00:50:15.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a very special part of the Scriptures
—1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:50:15.408 --> 00:50:17.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn there with me,

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:21.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to go through
and look at what these verses tell us

00:50:21.247 --> 00:50:25.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
about after the end
of the Thousand Year Reign.

00:50:27.211 --> 00:50:29.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
The section of Scripture
we’re going to consider

00:50:29.881 --> 00:50:32.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
is 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 24-28.

00:50:37.305 --> 00:50:40.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in verse 24, we’re told:

00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:42.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Next, the end,

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he hands over the Kingdom
to his God and Father,

00:50:46.314 --> 00:50:48.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he has brought to nothing

00:50:48.399 --> 00:50:52.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all government and all authority and power.

00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:54.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he must rule as king

00:50:54.071 --> 00:50:57.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until God has put
all enemies under his feet.

00:50:57.825 --> 00:51:00.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the last enemy, death,

00:51:00.494 --> 00:51:02.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to be brought to nothing.

00:51:02.872 --> 00:51:06.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God ‘subjected all things
under his feet.’

00:51:06.834 --> 00:51:10.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But when he says
that ‘all things have been subjected,’

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is evident that this does not include

00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:16.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One who subjected all things to him.

00:51:16.969 --> 00:51:20.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But when all things
will have been subjected to him,

00:51:20.514 --> 00:51:24.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then the Son himself
will also subject himself

00:51:24.352 --> 00:51:27.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the One who subjected all things to him,

00:51:27.897 --> 00:51:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God may be all things to everyone.”

00:51:34.862 --> 00:51:39.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do these verses tell us
about the end of the Thousand Year Reign?

00:51:39.784 --> 00:51:43.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back to verse 24.

00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:46.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says: “Next, the end . . .”

00:51:46.749 --> 00:51:50.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this “end” mentioned here
is not Armageddon.

00:51:50.795 --> 00:51:54.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the end of the Thousand Year Reign.

00:51:55.716 --> 00:51:58.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the Thousand Year Reign,

00:51:58.511 --> 00:52:02.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are some other things too
that will have finished.

00:52:02.223 --> 00:52:04.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means for a start,

00:52:04.225 --> 00:52:07.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
the end of the Kingdom arrangement.

00:52:07.687 --> 00:52:10.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will also be an end to sin,

00:52:10.564 --> 00:52:12.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means that mankind will no longer need

00:52:12.942 --> 00:52:16.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ransom or a mediator or priesthood.

00:52:16.278 --> 00:52:19.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 26, notice it says:

00:52:19.699 --> 00:52:23.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The last enemy, death,
is to be brought to nothing.”

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, the graves will be empty.

00:52:25.955 --> 00:52:29.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who have experienced the Adamic death

00:52:29.125 --> 00:52:31.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have been brought back.

00:52:31.752 --> 00:52:36.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mankind will all attain to perfection
with the end of sin

00:52:36.757 --> 00:52:39.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Adamic sin.

00:52:39.343 --> 00:52:42.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at that point in time,

00:52:42.054 --> 00:52:47.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
something very, very special happens.

00:52:47.059 --> 00:52:49.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:52:49.311 --> 00:52:53.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back
to the beginning of our discussion

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:58.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we talked about the problems
that occurred in the garden of Eden.

00:52:58.195 --> 00:53:02.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Satan the Devil raised some issues

00:53:02.283 --> 00:53:05.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resulted in a symbolic court case

00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:09.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
that involves the sanctification
of Jehovah’s name.

00:53:09.415 --> 00:53:12.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Satan had claimed
that Jehovah is a liar,

00:53:12.585 --> 00:53:16.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he doesn’t rule mankind out of love,

00:53:16.297 --> 00:53:18.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he even raised the question later

00:53:18.299 --> 00:53:21.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
about who would actually serve Jehovah.

00:53:21.552 --> 00:53:24.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this issue has continued on

00:53:24.263 --> 00:53:28.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the issue of the sanctification
of Jehovah’s name—right down through history.

00:53:28.642 --> 00:53:32.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
And over and over again,
Jehovah’s name has been sanctified.

00:53:32.813 --> 00:53:35.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
His reputation has been vindicated.

00:53:35.775 --> 00:53:37.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see that he’s a loving God,

00:53:37.777 --> 00:53:42.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
unlike Satan
—such a horrible person.

00:53:42.073 --> 00:53:47.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah has stood out
as being a loving heavenly Father.

00:53:48.329 --> 00:53:51.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now at this point in time,

00:53:51.791 --> 00:53:56.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can say the universal court case
comes to a conclusion.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
The issue is settled—the verdict is given.

00:54:02.134 --> 00:54:04.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:54:04.345 --> 00:54:08.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus has just finished ruling mankind
for a thousand years,

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:13.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the 144,000
that have made the earth a paradise.

00:54:13.312 --> 00:54:17.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mankind is now no longer sinners;
they’re perfect.

00:54:17.274 --> 00:54:19.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the problems have been healed.

00:54:19.819 --> 00:54:23.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this point in time, what does Jesus do?

00:54:23.823 --> 00:54:27.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he follow the example of Satan
and say: ‘Well, you know,

00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:30.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I think we did a very, very good job
for this thousand years.

00:54:30.955 --> 00:54:33.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So let’s just keep everything in place,

00:54:33.707 --> 00:54:36.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll keep on ruling in the Kingdom.’

00:54:36.877 --> 00:54:39.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we saw what he does.

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:42.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point in time,

00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:45.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a marvelous answer in this court case

00:54:45.886 --> 00:54:50.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus hands over
the Kingdom back to his Father.

00:54:50.808 --> 00:54:52.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
He submits to Jehovah’s rule.

00:54:52.977 --> 00:54:54.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s just as if Jehovah

00:54:54.979 --> 00:54:58.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
is told by his loving Son, Jesus:

00:54:58.107 --> 00:55:01.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You were right all along.

00:55:01.527 --> 00:55:03.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This whole thing

00:55:03.529 --> 00:55:07.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been a terrible travesty of justice.

00:55:07.074 --> 00:55:09.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is a despicable liar.”

00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:13.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all mankind, including Jesus

00:55:13.164 --> 00:55:15.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the 144,000,

00:55:15.374 --> 00:55:18.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
submit themselves to Jehovah’s rulership.

00:55:18.711 --> 00:55:22.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the end of the universal issue.

00:55:24.091 --> 00:55:28.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will then rule directly
over perfect mankind.

00:55:28.804 --> 00:55:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is that the point in time
when universal peace is restored?

00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:36.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, remember, there are some other things
that need to occur.

00:55:36.437 --> 00:55:39.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve already mentioned
that Satan will be released

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his symbolic prison.

00:55:41.775 --> 00:55:45.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll have an opportunity
to try and mislead some.

00:55:45.362 --> 00:55:47.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for those who side with him,

00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:51.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah morally and ethically
doesn’t have to wait any longer

00:55:51.535 --> 00:55:53.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say: ‘Well, let’s have
another court case.’

00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:57.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, they are executed immediately.

00:55:58.375 --> 00:56:01.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the rest of mankind?

00:56:01.086 --> 00:56:04.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
They become Jehovah’s sons and daughters.

00:56:04.006 --> 00:56:07.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can talk to him directly
without the need of a mediator.

00:56:07.468 --> 00:56:11.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then names will be written permanently
in “the book of life.”

00:56:11.722 --> 00:56:16.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ll be approved
to live forever in Paradise.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this point, when we’re thinking

00:56:18.229 --> 00:56:21.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
about all these beautiful things
that will occur,

00:56:21.232 --> 00:56:24.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s enjoy the final video
of our convention.

00:56:24.693 --> 00:56:29.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlights the blessings
of the Thousand Year Reign and beyond.

00:56:29.281 --> 00:56:31.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also, we’re going to listen

00:56:31.992 --> 00:56:36.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the original song that we will sing
at the conclusion of our program.

00:56:50.803 --> 00:56:57.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an island of calm
In dark stormy seas,

00:56:57.768 --> 00:57:03.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people
are living in peace.

00:57:03.774 --> 00:57:10.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our eyes of faith,
We see beyond the clouds

00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that the storm
soon will cease.

00:57:16.537 --> 00:57:23.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:57:29.258 --> 00:57:36.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:57:36.473 --> 00:57:47.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see
Peace at last.

00:57:49.653 --> 00:57:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the new world is here,
All will be one

00:57:56.744 --> 00:58:02.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
On earth
and in heaven above.

00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:09.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace we’ll know
We’ve never known before—

00:58:09.673 --> 00:58:15.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
A world ruled
by justice and love.

00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:22.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:58:22.436 --> 00:58:28.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:58:28.317 --> 00:58:35.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:58:35.783 --> 00:58:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see
Peace at last.

00:59:00.432 --> 00:59:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:59:07.439 --> 00:59:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:59:13.362 --> 00:59:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:25.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see.

00:59:25.916 --> 00:59:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:59:32.881 --> 00:59:38.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:59:38.804 --> 00:59:46.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:59:46.103 --> 00:59:57.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see
Peace at last,

00:59:57.239 --> 01:00:05.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace at last!

01:00:11.753 --> 01:00:13.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful song!

01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:17.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what beautiful images to encourage us!

01:00:17.468 --> 01:00:22.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So brothers and sisters, we’ve enjoyed
our convention program, haven’t we?

01:00:22.347 --> 01:00:26.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us be determined to keep pursuing peace,

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:30.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
not an imitation peace, but the real peace.

01:00:30.063 --> 01:00:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can enjoy rich blessings now

01:00:32.608 --> 01:00:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
by having a peaceful relationship
with Jehovah God,

01:00:36.153 --> 01:00:40.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, trying to continue
to maintain peace with one another

01:00:40.282 --> 01:00:45.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also attaining to this inner peace
—calmness and tranquility—

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have friendship
with the God who gives us hope.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that hope helps us to look to the future,

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:55.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we have difficulties now,

01:00:55.339 --> 01:00:57.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look forward to the time

01:00:57.341 --> 01:01:01.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
when universal peace is finally restored.

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the meantime, may the God of peace

01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:09.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
be with each one of you now and forever!

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Jackson.

01:01:13.649 --> 01:01:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your talk and this entire convention
have strengthened our confidence

01:01:18.654 --> 01:01:20.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s prophetic Word

01:01:20.739 --> 01:01:24.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped us to understand
how close we are to its fulfillment.

01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body

01:01:29.164 --> 01:01:32.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the hardworking members
of our Bethel families

01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:35.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and translation offices around the world,

01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:40.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
we thank you for watching
the 2022 convention program.

01:01:41.385 --> 01:01:44.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have deep appreciation and affection

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:46.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each one of you,

01:01:46.848 --> 01:01:49.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is our prayer

01:01:49.059 --> 01:01:53.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah continue
to bless you with peace.

01:01:54.356 --> 01:01:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s conclude by singing a song

01:01:56.984 --> 01:02:01.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reflects the complete peace
that Jehovah will soon bring about.

01:02:01.572 --> 01:02:04.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please join in singing
the original song

01:02:04.908 --> 01:02:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace at Last!”

01:02:07.035 --> 01:02:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we heard during the concluding talk.

01:02:09.746 --> 01:02:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the song,

01:02:11.748 --> 01:02:15.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may have your concluding prayer
at your individual locations.

01:02:15.669 --> 01:02:20.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we invite all to sing out along
with the Watchtower chorus

01:02:20.465 --> 01:02:22.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace at Last!”

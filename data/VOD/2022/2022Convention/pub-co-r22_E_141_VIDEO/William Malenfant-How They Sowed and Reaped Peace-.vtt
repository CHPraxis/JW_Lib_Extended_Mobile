00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inherited imperfection

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we don’t like it, but we all have it.

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:11.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since imperfection means

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everyone is less than perfect,

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:18.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are bound to be treated unfairly at times,

00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:22.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
even by fellow Christians.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
In rare cases, one might become
the victim of slander

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:29.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even fraud.

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider with me an account about slander

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:37.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
that occurred in the nation of Israel
in the days of King David.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:40.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s about a man named Mephibosheth

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:45.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was slandered by a man named Ziba.

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:47.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Examining the way

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:51.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Mephibosheth handled this matter

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be of real help to us to sow peace

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to reap peace.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonathan was Mephibosheth’s father,

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and King Saul was his grandfather.

00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:08.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jonathan and Saul died,

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
King David gave to Mephibosheth

00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:13.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the land of his grandfather.

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:18.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
David assigned Ziba as a servant

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:20.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take care of the land

00:01:20.107 --> 00:01:23.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had given to Mephibosheth.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:27.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, a rebellion
in David’s household

00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:31.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
forced him to flee from Jerusalem,

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Ziba went out to meet David.

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David asked Ziba about Mephibosheth

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why he didn’t come with Ziba

00:01:41.547 --> 00:01:44.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show his support for David,

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:47.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ziba slandered Mephibosheth,

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:52.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that he was seeking the kingship
for himself.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:57.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sad to say, David believed the slander

00:01:57.522 --> 00:02:01.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave Mephibosheth’s land to Ziba.

00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:07.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime later, Mephibosheth
met with King David

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and explained why he didn’t show up

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
to travel with him.

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:17.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told David that Ziba had lied about him.

00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:21.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon hearing
Mephibosheth’s side of the story,

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:23.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
David now decided

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:27.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he and Ziba should share the land.

00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:32.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of complaining or seeking vengeance,

00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:34.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth displayed

00:02:34.395 --> 00:02:38.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spiritual qualities of a peacemaker,

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:42.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was willing to be wronged.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to David, as recorded

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:49.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel chapter 19

00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 30,

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:54.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
these words:

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this Mephibosheth said to the king:

00:02:58.254 --> 00:03:00.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let him take it all,

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘now that my lord the king

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:06.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
has come to his house in peace.’”

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:09.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Mephibosheth was more concerned

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
about David’s kingship

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
than he was about himself.

00:03:15.523 --> 00:03:18.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a brother reacts

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:23.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a perceived injustice

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:25.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereafter

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he sows peace with his brothers.

00:03:35.336 --> 00:03:36.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first time we met David,

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were in chains!

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:42.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d seen a lot of things
during my time as a guard,

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:47.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
but nothing like the peace that you all had.

00:03:47.724 --> 00:03:49.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prison chains may be strong,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we all had something much stronger.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we had to work for that peace.

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:59.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right, Phil?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:06.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, there was a misunderstanding

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
that got blown all out of proportion.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t handle it the best.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:18.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more I tried to defend myself,
the worse it became.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t true.

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know me!

00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:35.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t prepared
for how far it would go.

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:38.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one more announcement.

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:42.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Philip Kim
is no longer serving as an elder.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that brings our meeting to a close.

00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:46.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we can stand.

00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:51.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next few months were a real struggle.

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when more details came to light,

00:04:55.214 --> 00:04:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I’d be reappointed,

00:04:58.593 --> 00:04:59.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I wasn’t.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:07.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil!

00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:09.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand why.

00:05:09.896 --> 00:05:11.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil, come on . . .

00:05:11.148 --> 00:05:15.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt bitterness growing inside.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:16.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil, you know . . .

00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything became about me

00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:32.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how I felt, what I deserved.

00:05:33.797 --> 00:05:38.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a fog that stopped me
from seeing what Jehovah deserved,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I really needed his help.

00:05:43.683 --> 00:05:47.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort
in accounts of Jehovah’s servants

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were either misunderstood or misjudged

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:55.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maintained their loyalty to Him.

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:05.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me realize that it’s a privilege

00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:08.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be in Jehovah’s organization.

00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:12.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being at peace with my brothers

00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:16.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important
than any appointed position.

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:22.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without peace, I don’t know
how we could’ve managed what was to come.

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:35.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your arthritis bad today?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I’ll be your secretary

00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:40.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Baruch was to Jeremiah.

00:06:40.744 --> 00:06:42.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what I’d do without you.

00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:53.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question now for all of us is,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate the example

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:59.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Mephibosheth?

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, if you are the victim

00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:07.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
of minor gossip or rude treatment by someone,

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:10.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not choose to let it pass

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:13.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not make a big issue of it?

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:18.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that what 1 Peter 4:8 advises?

00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:21.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 4:8 reads:

00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Above all things,

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:27.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
have intense love for one another.”

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:30.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it tells us what our love can do.

00:07:30.632 --> 00:07:33.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:07:33.176 --> 00:07:37.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because love covers a multitude of sins.”

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:42.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, love covers sins and imperfections

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:44.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are willing

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let love have its way.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if you are the victim

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:54.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a more serious injustice?

00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:56.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the brother in the video

00:07:56.618 --> 00:07:59.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt that he was a victim of injustice

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was deleted as an elder.

00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:05.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tried to clarify matters,

00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:09.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since he didn’t get the response
he was hoping for,

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:12.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
he became very upset.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lost his peace, and he caused others

00:08:16.348 --> 00:08:19.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lose their peaceful relationship with him.

00:08:21.061 --> 00:08:23.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
To regain his peace,

00:08:23.647 --> 00:08:26.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother dug into the Scriptures,

00:08:26.484 --> 00:08:30.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for examples he could benefit from.

00:08:30.488 --> 00:08:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he prayerfully looked to Jehovah
to help him.

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:39.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could see the importance of self-control

00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:43.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being guided by God’s spirit.

00:08:43.627 --> 00:08:48.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, he was able
to be at peace with himself

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:52.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sow peace with his brothers.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:57.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think for a moment
about the unfair decision David made

00:08:57.434 --> 00:08:59.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he told Mephibosheth

00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:04.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he and Ziba were to share the land.

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:09.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ziba was the cause of the problem,
not Mephibosheth.

00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:11.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Mephibosheth

00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
displayed the qualities of a spiritual man

00:09:15.578 --> 00:09:19.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not looking out for his own interests,

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:21.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being patient,

00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:24.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by not seeking vengeance.

00:09:24.713 --> 00:09:26.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read with me

00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:30.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Samuel chapter 19,

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:34.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 25 through verse 28

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:39.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2 Samuel 19:25-28; it reads:

00:09:39.396 --> 00:09:41.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he came to Jerusalem

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, Mephibosheth went to Jerusalem]

00:09:45.194 --> 00:09:46.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to meet the king,

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:52.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the king said to him: ‘Why did you not go
with me, Mephibosheth?’

00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:54.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this he said:

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:57.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My lord the king, my servant tricked me.

00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:00.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For your servant had said,

00:10:00.043 --> 00:10:02.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Let me get my donkey saddled

00:10:02.212 --> 00:10:06.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that I may ride on it
and go with the king,”

00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for your servant is crippled.

00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:12.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But he slandered your servant
to my lord the king.

00:10:12.932 --> 00:10:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘However, my lord the king
is like an angel of the true God,

00:10:17.687 --> 00:10:21.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so do whatever seems good to you.

00:10:21.608 --> 00:10:23.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘All the household of my father

00:10:23.902 --> 00:10:27.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘could have been doomed to death
by my lord the king,

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:32.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and yet you placed your servant
among those eating at your table.

00:10:32.286 --> 00:10:34.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘So what right do I have

00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:38.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cry out further to the king?’”

00:10:38.418 --> 00:10:40.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s truly remarkable.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth was grateful for what he had,

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:46.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was seeking nothing more.

00:10:46.343 --> 00:10:49.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
He enjoyed peace of mind and heart.

00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:53.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a matter involving slander

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:56.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fraud arises today,

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Christian may choose to follow
Jesus’ instructions

00:10:59.357 --> 00:11:02.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 18:15-17.

00:11:02.944 --> 00:11:05.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, if for some reason,

00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:09.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
following that procedure
does not fully resolve the matter,

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:12.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she may choose to pursue it no further

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:14.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suffer a loss

00:11:14.957 --> 00:11:19.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than disturb the peace
of the congregation.

00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can leave any unresolved issues
with Jehovah,

00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:27.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that he sees what we do

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:29.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what others do,

00:11:29.848 --> 00:11:34.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will carry out justice
at the right time.

00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:37.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our own benefit,

00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:41.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
we really must try to let go of resentment.

00:11:41.694 --> 00:11:46.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do, we benefit ourselves.

00:11:46.032 --> 00:11:49.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we forgive, we forgive others

00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:51.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah forgives us.

00:11:51.788 --> 00:11:54.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that doesn’t mean
that we minimize or excuse

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:56.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wrong conduct of fellow believers.

00:11:56.669 --> 00:11:58.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:58.296 --> 00:12:01.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it does mean that we imitate Mephibosheth

00:12:01.883 --> 00:12:04.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
by letting go of resentment

00:12:04.636 --> 00:12:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pursuing peace.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
We draw closer to Jehovah

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following the advice at Psalm 55:22:

00:12:14.438 --> 00:12:17.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Throw your burden on Jehovah,

00:12:17.483 --> 00:12:19.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will sustain you.

00:12:19.694 --> 00:12:23.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never will he allow
the righteous one to fall.”

00:12:24.407 --> 00:12:27.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Romans 15:13 assures us,

00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:32.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “fill you with all joy and peace

00:12:32.457 --> 00:12:35.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
by your trusting in him.”

00:12:37.338 --> 00:12:41.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:12:41.634 --> 00:12:46.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:49.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:51.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Paul and Barnabas.”

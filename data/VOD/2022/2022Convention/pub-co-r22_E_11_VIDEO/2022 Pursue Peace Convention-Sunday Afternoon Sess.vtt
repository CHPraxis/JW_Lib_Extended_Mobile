00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, one and all!

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The concluding session of our
“Pursue Peace”! Convention is about to begin.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the music-video presentation,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflect on how learning about our Creator

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speaking about him to others

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us endure any test of faith

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:43.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
with joy and peace.

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the video.

00:09:41.733 --> 00:09:44.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to the final portion
of this convention,

00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:48.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
which corresponds to the Sunday
afternoon session on your program.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme scripture
is taken from Romans 15:13,

00:09:53.537 --> 00:09:55.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says in part:

00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:57.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:09:57.624 --> 00:10:01.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill you with all joy and peace.”

00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:04.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin, let’s sing a song that describes

00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:07.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
the blessings that God’s Kingdom will bring.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
The song is number 23,

00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Jehovah Begins His Rule”

00:10:12.723 --> 00:10:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
—song number 23.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Part 1 of our feature Bible drama,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw how Jehovah gave peace
to his servants in the past.

00:13:52.695 --> 00:13:56.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we near the conclusion
of this system of things,

00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:59.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we strengthen our confidence

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:04.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will fulfill his promises
for the future?

00:14:04.248 --> 00:14:08.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now invite you to watch Part 2
of the feature Bible drama 

00:14:08.669 --> 00:14:12.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah Guides Us in the Way of Peace.</i>

00:14:26.395 --> 00:14:29.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible prophecy is a fascinating subject.

00:14:29.857 --> 00:14:34.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prophecy is far more than
just predictions about the future.

00:14:34.862 --> 00:14:37.573 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows all the facts.

00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:40.201 line:10% position:50% align:center
He can even control and change factors

00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:42.453 line:10% position:50% align:center
to ensure the outcome he desires.

00:14:42.453 --> 00:14:45.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 55:11, he says:

00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:48.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My word that goes out of my mouth . . .

00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:51.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will not return to me without results, . . .

00:14:51.713 --> 00:14:54.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will have sure success.”

00:14:54.632 --> 00:14:56.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s prophecies

00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.679 line:10% position:50% align:center
have a perfect record of success.

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:02.474 line:10% position:50% align:center
He has led his people in the past.

00:15:02.474 --> 00:15:04.684 line:10% position:50% align:center
So when he prophesies

00:15:04.684 --> 00:15:09.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’ll lead his people
to real, lasting peace in the future,

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:13.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
The prophecies given to Daniel

00:15:15.862 --> 00:15:18.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
clearly show that God’s Kingdom

00:15:18.657 --> 00:15:22.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
will without a doubt
bring lasting peace for all mankind.

00:15:44.057 --> 00:15:45.934 line:10% position:50% align:center
I have found a man from the exiles of Judah

00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:47.978 line:10% position:50% align:center
who can make known the interpretation to the king.

00:15:47.978 --> 00:15:50.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know who he is.

00:15:52.065 --> 00:15:53.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you really make known to me

00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:55.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dream that I saw

00:15:55.152 --> 00:15:56.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its interpretation?

00:16:06.121 --> 00:16:08.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is your dream.

00:16:12.086 --> 00:16:15.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Great Timekeeper.

00:16:15.214 --> 00:16:17.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophetic portions of the book of Daniel

00:16:17.591 --> 00:16:19.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
build faith by showing that Jehovah knows

00:16:19.927 --> 00:16:21.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
the course of history centuries

00:16:21.971 --> 00:16:24.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even millenniums—in advance.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
While portions of these prophecies

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
were fulfilled in Daniel’s time,

00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:31.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of the details are being fulfilled

00:16:31.063 --> 00:16:33.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
right down to our day.

00:16:35.693 --> 00:16:36.652 line:10% position:50% align:center
So as we discover

00:16:36.652 --> 00:16:38.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
the significance of these prophecies,

00:16:38.154 --> 00:16:40.281 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’re excited about what lies ahead.

00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:42.658 line:10% position:50% align:center
And our confidence grows as we discern

00:16:42.658 --> 00:16:45.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has been leading
his people all along.

00:16:48.247 --> 00:16:50.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the days of those kings,

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:53.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:16:53.502 --> 00:16:56.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will never be destroyed.

00:16:58.174 --> 00:17:00.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
The divine dream

00:17:00.217 --> 00:17:03.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Daniel interprets
for King Nebuchadnezzar

00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:05.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
constitutes a prophecy

00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:09.852 line:10% position:50% align:center
crucial for the lasting peace of mankind

00:17:09.852 --> 00:17:14.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a promise from Jehovah
to set up a Kingdom

00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be vastly superior
to earthly kingdoms.

00:17:19.028 --> 00:17:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
History has shown us

00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:26.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
how every type
of human government imaginable has failed.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:30.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would Jehovah’s government come?

00:17:30.498 --> 00:17:33.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
When would it arrive?

00:17:33.293 --> 00:17:37.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
These were questions
Daniel himself likely had.

00:17:44.053 --> 00:17:46.765 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is “a Revealer of secrets.”

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.850 line:10% position:50% align:center
He would eventually answer

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
these questions in due time.

00:17:51.394 --> 00:17:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a diligent student of the Scriptures,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Daniel

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
had full faith and confidence

00:17:58.068 --> 00:17:59.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s ability

00:17:59.444 --> 00:18:02.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
to schedule events and bring them about.

00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:04.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now likely in his 90’s,

00:18:04.658 --> 00:18:07.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was particularly interested

00:18:07.118 --> 00:18:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
in prophecies regarding the restoration

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his beloved city, Jerusalem.

00:18:16.086 --> 00:18:18.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,

00:18:18.922 --> 00:18:21.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will turn my attention to you,

00:18:21.925 --> 00:18:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will make good my promise

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:30.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
by bringing you back to this place.”

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah’s prophecy

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:37.065 line:10% position:50% align:center
had given Daniel hope

00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:38.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
because it indicated that the Jews

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:41.069 line:10% position:50% align:center
would soon return to their homeland of Judah

00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:44.031 line:10% position:50% align:center
and rebuild Jerusalem along with its temple.

00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:47.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes sense
that Daniel would be interested

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:50.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the restoration of the temple
because from the time of King Solomon,

00:18:50.746 --> 00:18:55.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
the temple in Jerusalem
was the world center for worship of Jehovah.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:58.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was very important to the Jews.

00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:00.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Scriptures,

00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:03.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
the temple was often called
“the house of Jehovah.”

00:19:04.468 --> 00:19:09.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, after Jehovah allowed young Daniel
and the rest of the Israelites

00:19:09.473 --> 00:19:11.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be taken captive to Babylon,

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:15.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
the city of Jerusalem
and the temple were destroyed.

00:19:15.813 --> 00:19:19.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
So naturally, a God-fearing man like Daniel

00:19:19.733 --> 00:19:22.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be interested
in seeing the temple rebuilt.

00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:26.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, as a man of faith,

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:29.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel supplicates Jehovah.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah,

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
do hear,

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
do forgive.

00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:42.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah, do pay attention and act.

00:19:43.841 --> 00:19:45.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not delay,

00:19:45.843 --> 00:19:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your own sake,

00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:50.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
O my God.

00:19:54.519 --> 00:19:57.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Daniel,

00:19:57.188 --> 00:19:59.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
now I have come to give you

00:19:59.649 --> 00:20:01.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
insight and understanding.

00:20:05.363 --> 00:20:07.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
The visit of this angel

00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:11.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
gave Daniel some answers and a hope.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.204 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s messenger provided

00:20:13.204 --> 00:20:16.541 line:10% position:50% align:center
so many details of promises to come.

00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:18.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured Daniel

00:20:18.376 --> 00:20:21.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Jews would be restored
to their homeland.

00:20:21.504 --> 00:20:25.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their exile in Babylonia was almost over.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that wasn’t the end
of the angel’s message.

00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:31.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave Daniel insight

00:20:31.306 --> 00:20:34.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
into something of far greater significance.

00:20:34.893 --> 00:20:38.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was told when God’s people
could expect the arrival

00:20:38.313 --> 00:20:39.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the foretold Messiah.

00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:42.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Messiah would be the ruler
who would make it possible

00:20:42.692 --> 00:20:46.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
for obedient humans
to regain the blessing of perfect life

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
—free from sickness, free from death.

00:20:49.908 --> 00:20:52.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Messiah would pave the way

00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:54.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
for lasting peace for mankind.

00:20:56.665 --> 00:20:58.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a strengthening message

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Daniel to receive!

00:21:00.877 --> 00:21:03.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he likely had some questions.

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:07.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
The angel told Daniel
that Jerusalem and its temple

00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:12.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, at the time,

00:21:12.848 --> 00:21:15.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem and the temple were in shambles.

00:21:15.892 --> 00:21:17.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they rebuild it?

00:21:17.853 --> 00:21:20.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who would be responsible for this?

00:21:20.397 --> 00:21:23.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
Babylon had been overtaken by Medo-Persia,

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:25.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
pictured by the silver chest and arms

00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:28.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.

00:21:30.908 --> 00:21:32.367 line:10% position:50% align:center
Not long after

00:21:32.367 --> 00:21:34.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
this change in world rulership,

00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:35.621 line:10% position:50% align:center
Persian King Cyrus

00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:37.539 line:10% position:50% align:center
issued a royal decree.

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:40.793 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was a commission from Cyrus himself

00:21:40.793 --> 00:21:42.795 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the Jews to return to Jerusalem

00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:44.838 line:10% position:50% align:center
and rebuild the temple.

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:52.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Cyrus’ release of the Jews
was in notable contrast

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Babylonians’ desire
to keep them captive.

00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:58.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cyrus even authorized funds

00:21:58.352 --> 00:22:01.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the king’s house
to cover construction expenses.

00:22:01.772 --> 00:22:04.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would this pagan ruler

00:22:04.316 --> 00:22:06.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
have any interest in, first of all,

00:22:06.944 --> 00:22:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting the captive Jews free and, second,

00:22:10.406 --> 00:22:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
financing the rebuilding
of their temple in Jerusalem?

00:22:14.994 --> 00:22:19.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra’s words at 2 Chronicles 36:22 tell us:

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah stirred the spirit
of King Cyrus of Persia.”

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:30.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can maneuver events
to make sure his word is fulfilled.

00:22:30.676 --> 00:22:34.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can use anyone to accomplish his purpose,

00:22:34.722 --> 00:22:39.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this would include
even a foreign king, like Cyrus.

00:22:39.477 --> 00:22:44.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with this decree,
the Jews returned to Judah.

00:22:49.195 --> 00:22:51.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Launching a construction project

00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:53.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resettling an entire city

00:22:53.783 --> 00:22:56.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a major undertaking.

00:22:56.327 --> 00:22:59.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
High Priest Jeshua and Governor Zerubbabel

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
were appointed to take the lead

00:23:01.624 --> 00:23:03.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
in setting up the altar

00:23:03.209 --> 00:23:05.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rebuilding the temple.

00:23:06.129 --> 00:23:08.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this wasn’t without its challenges.

00:23:08.172 --> 00:23:12.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enemies of Judah sought
to sabotage the building of the temple,

00:23:12.427 --> 00:23:15.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
attempting to disrupt the peace.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initial attempts

00:23:17.098 --> 00:23:19.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
to halt the building progress failed;

00:23:19.392 --> 00:23:21.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
however, eventually these enemies succeeded

00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:22.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
in having an official ban

00:23:22.896 --> 00:23:25.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
placed on the temple-building work.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the problem here?

00:23:28.026 --> 00:23:30.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
It appears the Jews let fear of man

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
stop the building work

00:23:33.031 --> 00:23:35.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
after about 14 years of constant opposition.

00:23:38.745 --> 00:23:40.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there is a bigger picture at play here.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Daniel’s prophecy foretold

00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jerusalem and its temple

00:23:45.252 --> 00:23:48.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.

00:23:48.755 --> 00:23:51.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, with the work halted,

00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:53.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
the temple remained unfinished.

00:23:53.802 --> 00:23:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would that mean
for the coming of the Messiah?

00:23:56.346 --> 00:23:59.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeshua and Zerubbabel needed guidance.

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:03.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is where Jehovah
steps in to provide encouragement

00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:06.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
—first through the prophet Haggai.

00:24:09.192 --> 00:24:11.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haggai’s clear and powerful message

00:24:11.069 --> 00:24:13.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
gets right to the heart of the matter.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
He conveys Jehovah’s direction to get up

00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:18.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep building the temple despite opposition.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews had a decision to make here.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would they allow opposition
to hinder the work?

00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:28.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or would they listen to Jehovah’s words

00:24:28.629 --> 00:24:31.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Haggai
and keep rebuilding the temple?

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
To guide them further,
Jehovah spoke to the prophet Zechariah

00:24:35.886 --> 00:24:37.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave him visions

00:24:37.304 --> 00:24:39.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide the Jews with a message.

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:41.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zechariah made it clear to the Jews

00:24:41.558 --> 00:24:44.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would not allow
their opposers to harm them

00:24:44.853 --> 00:24:47.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
or thwart the temple-rebuilding work.

00:24:47.189 --> 00:24:50.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was only with Jehovah’s guidance
that the Jews would succeed.

00:24:50.985 --> 00:24:55.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Energized by Jehovah’s motivating words
through these two prophets,

00:24:55.531 --> 00:24:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
they courageously resumed construction

00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:00.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the temple, and it was inaugurated

00:25:00.786 --> 00:25:02.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 515 B.C.E.

00:25:02.955 --> 00:25:04.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it seems that at some point

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.542 line:10% position:50% align:center
over the following decades,

00:25:06.542 --> 00:25:09.295 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Jews lost their initial zeal.

00:25:10.963 --> 00:25:13.883 line:10% position:50% align:center
The temple was rebuilt and inaugurated,

00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:16.594 line:10% position:50% align:center
but Jerusalem’s walls and gates remained unfinished,

00:25:16.594 --> 00:25:19.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
with huge gaps left in them.

00:25:19.388 --> 00:25:23.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was significant because the city
was surrounded by enemy nations.

00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:26.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the protection of these walls,

00:25:26.103 --> 00:25:29.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem seemed vulnerable.

00:25:29.398 --> 00:25:31.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Nehemiah learned of this,

00:25:31.692 --> 00:25:34.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
he was visibly distressed.

00:25:34.195 --> 00:25:36.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
What’s going on, Hanani?

00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:38.783 line:10% position:50% align:center
How are our people?

00:25:39.617 --> 00:25:41.119 line:10% position:50% align:center
Not good.

00:25:41.744 --> 00:25:44.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:25:44.956 --> 00:25:48.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:51.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:25:52.922 --> 00:25:54.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the temple?

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:55.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stands,

00:25:55.425 --> 00:25:56.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the services

00:25:56.593 --> 00:25:58.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
are nothing but empty rituals.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the people and the priests

00:26:01.514 --> 00:26:03.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
ignore God’s Law.

00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:05.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah must have been shocked

00:26:05.769 --> 00:26:08.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear about the condition of Jerusalem.

00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:10.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this time, he was serving as cupbearer

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Persian King in Shushan.

00:26:12.525 --> 00:26:14.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
The journey from Shushan to Jerusalem

00:26:14.986 --> 00:26:17.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
was about 1,000 miles (1,600 km).

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
Still,

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah felt compelled to act.

00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:31.127 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah rejoiced at the prospect

00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:33.130 line:10% position:50% align:center
of rebuilding the walls.

00:26:36.091 --> 00:26:38.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews at this time

00:26:38.093 --> 00:26:40.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
were still fearful of their opposers,

00:26:40.178 --> 00:26:43.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Nehemiah was intent on changing that.

00:26:45.767 --> 00:26:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that Jehovah was behind the work.

00:26:48.645 --> 00:26:50.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if Jehovah is behind something,

00:26:50.981 --> 00:26:55.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no amount of opposition
that can thwart his will,

00:26:55.694 --> 00:26:59.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the wall repairs began.

00:27:02.284 --> 00:27:03.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t to say

00:27:03.702 --> 00:27:06.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there were not challenges along the way.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Opposers did not give up.

00:27:11.502 --> 00:27:14.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recommend we turn the accusation

00:27:14.254 --> 00:27:16.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:27:17.591 --> 00:27:19.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s brilliant!

00:27:19.593 --> 00:27:21.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:27:21.804 --> 00:27:24.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will beg for our help.

00:27:24.098 --> 00:27:26.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
These opposers threatened the Jews,

00:27:26.558 --> 00:27:28.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
schemed against them,

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:31.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even accused Nehemiah of treason.

00:27:33.774 --> 00:27:36.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah’s peace and the peace

00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:39.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Jews supporting the work was threatened.

00:27:39.613 --> 00:27:43.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
But despite the attempts of opposers,

00:27:43.075 --> 00:27:46.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah and the Jews looked to Jehovah

00:27:46.704 --> 00:27:49.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
for guidance and kept working.

00:27:51.917 --> 00:27:54.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah declares his purpose,

00:27:54.545 --> 00:27:57.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is nothing that can prevent him

00:27:57.673 --> 00:27:59.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
from carrying it out.

00:27:59.717 --> 00:28:03.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah wanted a rebuilt Jerusalem,

00:28:03.512 --> 00:28:06.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
complete with rebuilt walls,

00:28:06.057 --> 00:28:10.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah would have
complete faith in Jehovah’s ability

00:28:10.102 --> 00:28:12.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the rebuilding efforts.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with this support,

00:28:14.524 --> 00:28:17.235 line:10% position:50% align:center
the city walls were completed

00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:20.154 line:10% position:50% align:center
in just 52 days.

00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:24.534 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah, the wall is complete!

00:28:28.287 --> 00:28:29.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s it.

00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:34.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
With rebuilt walls and a rebuilt temple,

00:28:34.961 --> 00:28:38.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically the city was in good condition.

00:28:38.214 --> 00:28:41.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, about 12 years later,

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:44.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah returned to Shushan.

00:28:44.804 --> 00:28:49.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his prolonged absence,
the spiritual state of the Jews deteriorated.

00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:50.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so sad,

00:28:50.894 --> 00:28:54.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
as many in Israel
fell back into bad practices.

00:28:54.981 --> 00:28:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some in the priesthood,

00:28:56.483 --> 00:28:59.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
including High Priest Eliashib,

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:01.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer took their responsibilities seriously.

00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:05.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, Jehovah raised up the prophet Malachi 

00:29:05.158 --> 00:29:07.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counsel the negligent priests.

00:29:09.162 --> 00:29:11.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why have you Levites despised Jehovah’s name?

00:29:11.706 --> 00:29:12.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despised it?

00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:14.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
You present a blind,

00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:16.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
lame, or sick animal as a sacrifice

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say that it is nothing bad.

00:29:18.713 --> 00:29:20.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:22.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s another thing you do

00:29:22.217 --> 00:29:23.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he no longer

00:29:23.802 --> 00:29:25.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks favorably on anything you offer.

00:29:26.388 --> 00:29:28.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you betray the wife of your youth,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
although she’s your partner, your legal wife.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lips of a priest

00:29:33.603 --> 00:29:35.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
should safeguard knowledge,

00:29:35.355 --> 00:29:38.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and people should seek the law from his mouth.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you,

00:29:40.027 --> 00:29:42.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have made many stumble.

00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:47.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, Malachi’s words

00:29:47.242 --> 00:29:49.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
had little effect on the priesthood.

00:29:49.453 --> 00:29:53.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite his warnings,
the people refused to change.

00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:58.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Nehemiah returned,
what he found shocked him.

00:29:58.253 --> 00:30:00.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a long time,

00:30:00.339 --> 00:30:01.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
the priests and the Levites

00:30:01.673 --> 00:30:03.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
have not taken their duties seriously.

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:04.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the people saw that,

00:30:04.885 --> 00:30:06.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:30:06.512 --> 00:30:08.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the tithes,

00:30:08.847 --> 00:30:10.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
most Levites and singers

00:30:10.766 --> 00:30:12.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
returned to their fields.

00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:13.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Eliashib

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
not tell the people to bring your provisions?

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your absence,

00:30:17.648 --> 00:30:19.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Malachi warned him

00:30:19.191 --> 00:30:21.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the priests.

00:30:21.944 --> 00:30:23.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Eliashib—

00:30:23.946 --> 00:30:25.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took our storeroom

00:30:25.656 --> 00:30:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
and emptied it of our provisions.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave it to Tobiah to use as a dining hall.

00:30:31.454 --> 00:30:33.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
to no longer providing
financial support,

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:38.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people started
conducting business on the Sabbath.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:41.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you selling today?

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:45.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only the best quality fish from Tyre.

00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:48.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were marrying foreign women.

00:30:48.804 --> 00:30:50.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m marrying Gizla today.

00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:51.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gizla?

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:54.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Moabite girl?

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard you bind yourself with an oath

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a curse not to take a wife from the nations!

00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:03.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
This action could have disrupted

00:31:03.444 --> 00:31:04.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
the line to the Messiah,

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:08.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it definitely threatened
to contaminate pure worship.

00:31:08.658 --> 00:31:11.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men were bringing the restored nation

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:14.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
into disfavor with Jehovah.

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:17.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the same reason
why Jehovah allowed Babylon

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy Jerusalem in the first place.

00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:25.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Nehemiah took action
against these faithless ones.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please cleanse this room

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
and replace the utensils.

00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:33.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:31:33.933 --> 00:31:34.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my lord.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
And gather all the Levites,

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
the singers, and the deputy rulers to me.

00:31:37.854 --> 00:31:39.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m assigning them all back to their posts.

00:31:39.773 --> 00:31:42.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
He enforced the strict observance

00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:43.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Sabbath. 

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:44.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the meaning of this?

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:49.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know God’s Law:

00:31:49.282 --> 00:31:51.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
No work,

00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:53.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
no business on the Sabbath!

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:54.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go!

00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:56.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
You and all the Levites, guard the gates

00:31:56.373 --> 00:31:57.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep the Sabbath holy.

00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let anyone in!

00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:05.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
He disciplined those
who had taken foreign wives.

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:09.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you not?

00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:16.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes! Yes!

00:32:16.393 --> 00:32:18.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah 

00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:21.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your own oath?

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:26.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
was guiding Nehemiah’s efforts all along.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:29.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a spiritual cleansing was done,

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:33.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
a measure of peace was again enjoyed.

00:32:33.327 --> 00:32:35.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with this vigorous

00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:37.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
rooting out of apostasy,

00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:39.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
the record of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:41.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes to a close.

00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:47.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we don’t have
an inspired record of events

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the centuries leading up to Jesus’ birth,

00:32:50.594 --> 00:32:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
but history shows that Jerusalem

00:32:52.721 --> 00:32:55.349 line:10% position:50% align:center
underwent several changes during these years.

00:32:55.349 --> 00:32:57.768 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Medo-Persian Empire

00:32:57.768 --> 00:32:59.395 line:10% position:50% align:center
was overtaken by Greece,

00:32:59.395 --> 00:33:01.772 line:10% position:50% align:center
represented by the copper belly and thighs

00:33:01.772 --> 00:33:03.899 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.

00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:07.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the city seemed to survive
the change in control

00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:11.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
without any physical damage,
its spiritual state was threatened.

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:15.369 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Greek Empire set the stage for the spread

00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:18.539 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Greek language, culture, and religious thought,

00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:22.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
and Israel was affected by this influence.

00:33:23.794 --> 00:33:26.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years later, King Antiochus IV

00:33:26.297 --> 00:33:29.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
was determined to eradicate
Jewish worship and customs.

00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:33.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went so far as to sacrifice a pig

00:33:33.387 --> 00:33:34.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Greek god Zeus

00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:37.141 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the temple of Jehovah.

00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:39.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a vicious attempt

00:33:39.143 --> 00:33:41.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to defile and to stamp out pure worship.

00:33:41.896 --> 00:33:45.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the desecration
had the opposite effect.

00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:47.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sparked an uprising

00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:49.737 line:10% position:50% align:center
of zealous Jews, and three years later,

00:33:49.737 --> 00:33:51.114 line:10% position:50% align:center
they cleansed the temple

00:33:51.114 --> 00:33:53.116 line:10% position:50% align:center
and rededicated it to Jehovah.

00:33:54.742 --> 00:33:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
About a century later,

00:33:56.744 --> 00:33:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem experienced
another change in rulership

00:33:59.747 --> 00:34:03.042 line:10% position:50% align:center
as Rome became the dominant world power.

00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rome corresponded to the legs of iron

00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:09.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.

00:34:09.507 --> 00:34:10.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the rule

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:12.260 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Herod the Great,

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.096 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem enjoyed considerable prosperity.

00:34:15.096 --> 00:34:17.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
Herod’s greatest work, however,

00:34:17.223 --> 00:34:19.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the reconstruction of the temple

00:34:19.434 --> 00:34:21.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its building complex.

00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:23.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
The temple and its daily sacrifices

00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:25.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
remained in operation down to Jesus’ day.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible record picks up

00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:29.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Jesus was born.

00:34:45.961 --> 00:34:47.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah have mercy on us!

00:34:47.712 --> 00:34:48.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s happening?

00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:49.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the sun up already?

00:34:49.548 --> 00:34:51.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they . . .

00:34:51.133 --> 00:34:52.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
are they . . . angels?

00:34:52.884 --> 00:34:54.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be afraid,

00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:56.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
for look!

00:34:56.138 --> 00:34:57.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am declaring to you good news

00:34:57.973 --> 00:35:00.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a great joy that all the people will have.

00:35:00.517 --> 00:35:02.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
For today there was born

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:05.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
to you in David’s city a savior, 

00:35:05.022 --> 00:35:07.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is Christ the Lord.

00:35:07.149 --> 00:35:09.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ birth and ministry

00:35:09.192 --> 00:35:11.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
fulfilled many prophecies.

00:35:11.236 --> 00:35:15.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 29 C.E., Jehovah
anointed Jesus with holy spirit.

00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:19.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
This corresponds exactly
to the words of Daniel’s prophecy

00:35:19.828 --> 00:35:22.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah gave him
more than 500 years earlier.

00:35:22.915 --> 00:35:26.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
The promised Messiah had arrived!

00:35:26.877 --> 00:35:30.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early in his ministry, Jesus read these words

00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:34.259 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the prophecy of Isaiah.

00:35:34.259 --> 00:35:37.763 line:10% position:50% align:center
The scroll of Isaiah the prophet reads:

00:35:37.763 --> 00:35:41.433 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s spirit is upon me,

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:43.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because he anointed me

00:35:43.727 --> 00:35:46.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to declare good news to the poor.

00:35:46.397 --> 00:35:48.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He sent me

00:35:48.107 --> 00:35:49.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim liberty to the captives 

00:35:49.859 --> 00:35:52.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a recovery of sight to the blind,

00:35:52.403 --> 00:35:54.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to send the crushed ones away free,

00:35:55.197 --> 00:35:58.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.”

00:36:06.917 --> 00:36:09.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today this scripture

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:36:19.639 --> 00:36:21.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Holy spirit empowered Jesus to perform

00:36:21.933 --> 00:36:25.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
many miracles
in just a few short years on earth.

00:36:25.603 --> 00:36:29.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
This had a profound effect
on the people living in his day.

00:36:29.315 --> 00:36:32.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am a very sick woman.

00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:35.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve suffered from a flow of blood

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some 12 years.

00:36:37.573 --> 00:36:39.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can heal me!

00:36:39.826 --> 00:36:41.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if I could touch

00:36:41.995 --> 00:36:44.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
just the fringes

00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:47.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his outer garment, I will get well!

00:36:58.261 --> 00:37:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who touched my outer garment?

00:37:00.263 --> 00:37:02.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who touched me?

00:37:02.348 --> 00:37:05.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, . . .

00:37:05.435 --> 00:37:07.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
please forgive me, my Lord.

00:37:07.729 --> 00:37:10.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was I who touched you!

00:37:11.107 --> 00:37:13.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have faith in you!

00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:16.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that if I could just touch

00:37:16.571 --> 00:37:19.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fringes of your outer garment,

00:37:19.074 --> 00:37:21.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could get well.

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:24.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take courage, daughter!

00:37:24.663 --> 00:37:27.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your faith has made you well.

00:37:31.211 --> 00:37:33.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
The miracles Jesus performed were unlike

00:37:33.797 --> 00:37:35.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
anything the people had seen before.

00:37:35.882 --> 00:37:38.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, the people had hope

00:37:38.885 --> 00:37:42.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a hope for the future, a hope for peace.

00:37:42.806 --> 00:37:47.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even demonstrated that he had power
far beyond any human ruler.

00:37:49.187 --> 00:37:51.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord, Mary is here!

00:37:59.448 --> 00:38:00.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord!

00:38:00.866 --> 00:38:02.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you had been here,

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
my brother would not have died!

00:38:14.129 --> 00:38:15.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lazarus!

00:38:15.506 --> 00:38:17.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come out!

00:38:35.401 --> 00:38:37.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Free him, and let him go!

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is so much we can learn

00:38:42.283 --> 00:38:45.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jesus’ miracles, works, and teachings.

00:38:45.661 --> 00:38:48.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reveal Jehovah’s purpose and power.

00:38:48.914 --> 00:38:50.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
They show how enjoyable,

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:55.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
how peaceful life will be
under God’s Messianic Ruler.

00:38:55.713 --> 00:38:59.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans alive at this time
could see visible proof of this.

00:38:59.634 --> 00:39:02.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ ministry accomplished so much

00:39:02.595 --> 00:39:05.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just three and a half years.

00:39:05.348 --> 00:39:07.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
And prophecy regarding the Messiah

00:39:07.767 --> 00:39:11.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued to be fulfilled
as his opposers succeeded

00:39:11.437 --> 00:39:13.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
in putting him to death.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the sacrifice

00:39:27.036 --> 00:39:28.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ perfect human life,

00:39:28.705 --> 00:39:30.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire arrangement

00:39:30.665 --> 00:39:32.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
for worshipping Jehovah had changed.

00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:36.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no longer a need
for animal sacrifices.

00:39:36.546 --> 00:39:41.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pure worship was no longer centered
around the temple in Jerusalem.

00:39:41.175 --> 00:39:46.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only way to worship Jehovah acceptably
was through the Messiah.

00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:49.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now people everywhere
could find the way to peace

00:39:49.893 --> 00:39:52.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
through faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:39:54.355 --> 00:39:56.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jewish system of worship

00:39:56.357 --> 00:39:58.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the Mosaic Law was over.

00:39:58.401 --> 00:40:01.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
no longer had Jehovah’s favor.

00:40:01.863 --> 00:40:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ perfect human sacrifice

00:40:04.491 --> 00:40:07.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the only solution for lasting peace.

00:40:07.577 --> 00:40:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did this mean
for the city of Jerusalem and the temple?

00:40:12.582 --> 00:40:14.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, before his death,

00:40:14.584 --> 00:40:17.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus provided his followers with a warning

00:40:17.295 --> 00:40:19.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jerusalem’s destruction.

00:40:19.548 --> 00:40:23.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 21:20, 21, he says:

00:40:23.176 --> 00:40:25.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When you see Jerusalem

00:40:25.178 --> 00:40:27.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“surrounded by encamped armies,

00:40:27.472 --> 00:40:29.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then know that the desolating of her

00:40:29.516 --> 00:40:30.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has drawn near. . . .

00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:33.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let those in the midst of her leave,

00:40:33.478 --> 00:40:37.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let those in the countryside
not enter into her.”

00:40:37.149 --> 00:40:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good ruler guides his people.

00:40:39.943 --> 00:40:44.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although it wasn’t yet time for him
to take the throne as Ruler of God’s Kingdom,

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:49.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus (by the way he acted) gave us insight
into the kind of ruler he would be.

00:40:51.413 --> 00:40:53.540 line:10% position:50% align:center
By providing first-century Christians

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.626 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a warning to leave Jerusalem

00:40:55.626 --> 00:40:57.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
and all Judea,

00:40:57.002 --> 00:41:00.130 line:10% position:50% align:center
he was guiding them and protecting them.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:03.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus prophesied the destruction of the city,

00:41:03.008 --> 00:41:05.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just a few decades later,

00:41:05.094 --> 00:41:07.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
that prophecy came true.

00:41:07.137 --> 00:41:10.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Roman Empire still had control of Judea,

00:41:10.683 --> 00:41:12.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tensions ran high

00:41:12.268 --> 00:41:14.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the Romans and the Jews.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, the Jews

00:41:16.146 --> 00:41:17.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
revolted against Roman rule.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the city surrounded

00:41:33.122 --> 00:41:34.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Roman forces closing in,

00:41:34.832 --> 00:41:36.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seemed there was no way out.

00:41:36.834 --> 00:41:40.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s word cannot go unfulfilled.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
For no apparent reason,

00:41:42.214 --> 00:41:44.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Roman forces withdrew!

00:41:48.387 --> 00:41:50.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
For faithful Christians,

00:41:50.389 --> 00:41:52.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was their opportunity.

00:41:53.643 --> 00:41:55.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s simple:

00:41:55.645 --> 00:41:57.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who followed Jesus’ direction

00:41:57.688 --> 00:42:00.358 line:10% position:50% align:center
to leave Judea were guided to safety.

00:42:00.358 --> 00:42:02.360 line:10% position:50% align:center
For those who delayed,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.239 line:10% position:50% align:center
escape became difficult or impossible.

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:15.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no doubt

00:42:15.164 --> 00:42:19.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jerusalem no longer enjoyed
Jehovah’s special favor and protection.

00:42:26.175 --> 00:42:28.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city and its temple

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:30.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
were completely destroyed.

00:42:41.149 --> 00:42:44.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are parallels we can draw
from the warning Jesus gave

00:42:44.694 --> 00:42:47.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those first-century Christians

00:42:47.155 --> 00:42:49.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the warning we
have been given for our day.

00:42:49.908 --> 00:42:52.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus gave us one composite sign

00:42:52.744 --> 00:42:56.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
that indicates the destruction
of this current system of things

00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:58.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
is very close.

00:42:58.124 --> 00:43:01.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prophecies in the Bible give us no doubt

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are living in “the last days.”

00:43:03.922 --> 00:43:08.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has not revealed all the details
of how everything will work out.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we know that everything
he has revealed will come true.

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:15.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes details outlining
how world events

00:43:15.684 --> 00:43:17.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
would unfold in the time
of the end

00:43:17.894 --> 00:43:21.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
before mankind
would experience permanent peace.

00:43:21.648 --> 00:43:25.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Daniel’s prophecy indicated

00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there would be
only one dominant world power in place

00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:30.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the time of the end.

00:43:30.657 --> 00:43:32.201 line:10% position:50% align:center
By World War I,

00:43:32.201 --> 00:43:34.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
the power represented by the feet 

00:43:34.036 --> 00:43:36.413 line:10% position:50% align:center
of iron and clay had emerged.

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:39.666 line:10% position:50% align:center
During that war, Britain and America

00:43:39.666 --> 00:43:41.627 line:10% position:50% align:center
forged a partnership

00:43:41.627 --> 00:43:44.797 line:10% position:50% align:center
that continued through the Second World War.

00:43:47.049 --> 00:43:49.301 line:10% position:50% align:center
This means a special relationship

00:43:49.301 --> 00:43:52.388 line:10% position:50% align:center
between the British Commonwealth and Empire

00:43:52.388 --> 00:43:54.932 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the United States of America.

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:57.935 line:10% position:50% align:center
Neither the sure prevention of war

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:00.938 line:10% position:50% align:center
nor the continuous rise

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:03.941 line:10% position:50% align:center
of world organization will begin

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:06.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
without what I have called

00:44:06.986 --> 00:44:08.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
the fraternal association

00:44:08.279 --> 00:44:09.947 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the English-speaking people.

00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:17.705 line:10% position:50% align:center
These two countries

00:44:17.705 --> 00:44:21.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to be a dual
English-speaking world power.

00:44:21.417 --> 00:44:23.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
The characteristics of iron and clay

00:44:23.711 --> 00:44:26.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to represent
this world power are significant.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the toes of the feet

00:44:29.842 --> 00:44:32.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:44:32.637 --> 00:44:34.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the kingdom

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:38.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be partly strong and partly fragile.

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:44.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the United States and Britain

00:44:44.524 --> 00:44:46.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
have displayed ironlike strength

00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:49.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
through their involvement in armed conflicts.

00:44:51.572 --> 00:44:55.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, iron mixed with clay
is considerably weakened.

00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:58.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can be observed as common people

00:44:58.037 --> 00:45:01.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
undermined the Anglo-American
World Power’s ability

00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
to act with ironlike strength.

00:45:05.878 --> 00:45:07.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the political and social developments

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
foretold in the Bible come to a climax,

00:45:10.675 --> 00:45:12.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a measure of peace.

00:45:12.844 --> 00:45:15.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know Jehovah will guide his people,

00:45:15.513 --> 00:45:20.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
even as the world’s spiritual
and moral condition sinks to new depths.

00:45:22.312 --> 00:45:24.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
As many in first-century Jerusalem

00:45:24.439 --> 00:45:26.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued their lives

00:45:26.483 --> 00:45:28.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if nothing had changed,

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
so, too, today many

00:45:30.737 --> 00:45:32.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue on with their lives.

00:45:32.864 --> 00:45:34.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, we remain alert

00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:37.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we see fulfillment of Bible prophecy

00:45:37.577 --> 00:45:40.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
right before our eyes.

00:45:40.038 --> 00:45:42.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the days of those kings,

00:45:42.832 --> 00:45:46.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:45:46.503 --> 00:45:48.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will never be destroyed.

00:45:49.464 --> 00:45:51.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Revelation

00:45:51.466 --> 00:45:53.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us what will soon happen.

00:45:53.677 --> 00:45:57.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
The political rulers of the world
will give the United Nations

00:45:57.597 --> 00:46:00.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
unprecedented power and authority.

00:46:00.684 --> 00:46:03.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul foretold
that the nations will declare

00:46:03.478 --> 00:46:06.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace and security!”

00:46:06.148 --> 00:46:08.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it won’t prove to be true peace.

00:46:11.528 --> 00:46:13.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
The nations supporting the UN

00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:16.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
will attack the institutions
of false religion.

00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:27.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a coalition of earth’s governments
that the prophet Ezekiel

00:46:27.961 --> 00:46:30.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
calls “Gog of the land of Magog”

00:46:30.214 --> 00:46:32.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
will attack God’s people.

00:46:32.591 --> 00:46:36.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we don’t need to be fearful.

00:46:36.345 --> 00:46:38.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when we can put into action

00:46:38.764 --> 00:46:40.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the lessons we’ve learned.

00:46:40.641 --> 00:46:44.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who trust and obey Jehovah’s guidance

00:46:44.353 --> 00:46:46.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
can look to the near future with confidence.

00:46:46.897 --> 00:46:49.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve seen, Jehovah has always been

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
in control of the situation.

00:46:51.902 --> 00:46:53.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has never guided his people

00:46:53.904 --> 00:46:57.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a certain direction
but then failed to provide for them.

00:46:57.241 --> 00:47:00.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we can say
that the lessons we learn

00:47:00.411 --> 00:47:02.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the faithful men we’ve studied

00:47:02.413 --> 00:47:04.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
are more than just lessons.

00:47:04.415 --> 00:47:09.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has been Jehovah
paving the way for peace from the start.

00:47:09.253 --> 00:47:13.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, we see exactly
how Jehovah has led his people.

00:47:13.924 --> 00:47:18.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took many years,
but he’s been in control the whole time.

00:47:18.137 --> 00:47:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it make sense
to think he isn’t in control anymore?

00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:24.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
No power in heaven or on earth

00:47:24.894 --> 00:47:28.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
can prevent Jehovah
from accomplishing his express purpose.

00:47:28.856 --> 00:47:31.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has never relinquished control,

00:47:31.692 --> 00:47:34.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is still guiding his people.

00:47:34.821 --> 00:47:36.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think about this:

00:47:36.864 --> 00:47:41.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah has guided
his people to this point,

00:47:41.077 --> 00:47:43.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can have full confidence

00:47:43.121 --> 00:47:46.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that trust and obedience to his direction

00:47:46.207 --> 00:47:48.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
will prove to be our salvation,

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if a way out seems impossible.

00:47:53.214 --> 00:47:56.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is all-powerful!

00:47:56.718 --> 00:48:01.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to help us
through whatever we may face.

00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t have to fight,

00:48:15.362 --> 00:48:17.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we won’t need to fear annihilation.

00:48:17.322 --> 00:48:20.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has things

00:48:20.241 --> 00:48:22.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
under control.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:24.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this kingdom

00:48:24.996 --> 00:48:27.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will not be passed on to any other people.

00:48:29.918 --> 00:48:31.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will crush and put an end

00:48:31.962 --> 00:48:34.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to all these kingdoms.

00:48:50.605 --> 00:48:53.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it alone will stand forever.”

00:48:54.359 --> 00:48:56.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom will fill

00:48:56.361 --> 00:48:58.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and renew the entire earth.

00:49:02.367 --> 00:49:04.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promises

00:49:04.369 --> 00:49:06.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be completely fulfilled.

00:49:07.956 --> 00:49:11.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lasting peace will finally become

00:49:11.043 --> 00:49:14.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reality for all mankind.

00:49:14.046 --> 00:49:17.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just imagine what faithful servants

00:49:17.174 --> 00:49:20.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
have to look forward to
under Jesus’ heavenly rule!

00:49:20.427 --> 00:49:25.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will be able to provide
what no man ever could.

00:49:25.432 --> 00:49:28.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what that will be like?

00:49:49.081 --> 00:49:50.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For look!

00:49:50.499 --> 00:49:54.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am creating new heavens and a new earth;

00:49:54.712 --> 00:49:57.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the former things
will not be called to mind,

00:50:00.926 --> 00:50:03.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor will they come up into the heart.”

00:50:07.558 --> 00:50:10.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,

00:50:12.188 --> 00:50:15.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will live forever on it.”

00:50:36.254 --> 00:50:38.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will swallow up death forever,

00:50:41.134 --> 00:50:45.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
will wipe away the tears from all faces.”

00:50:54.981 --> 00:50:58.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will wipe out every tear from their eyes,

00:50:58.943 --> 00:51:00.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and death will be no more, 

00:51:00.945 --> 00:51:03.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither will mourning

00:51:03.031 --> 00:51:06.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:51:08.578 --> 00:51:10.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:51:37.399 --> 00:51:40.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time the eyes

00:51:40.819 --> 00:51:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the blind will be opened,

00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:47.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

00:51:53.665 --> 00:51:56.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time the lame

00:51:56.084 --> 00:51:58.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will leap like the deer,

00:51:59.713 --> 00:52:02.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the tongue of the speechless

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will shout for joy.

00:52:09.098 --> 00:52:11.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For waters will burst forth
in the wilderness,

00:52:16.188 --> 00:52:18.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and streams in the desert plain.”

00:52:26.323 --> 00:52:28.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses and live in them,

00:52:37.877 --> 00:52:41.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.”

00:52:52.475 --> 00:52:56.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:52:57.522 --> 00:52:59.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the work of their hands

00:53:01.108 --> 00:53:04.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:09.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:53:14.288 --> 00:53:16.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will find exquisite delight

00:53:16.916 --> 00:53:19.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the abundance of peace.”

00:53:34.601 --> 00:53:37.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a faith-strengthening drama!

00:53:37.437 --> 00:53:39.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are at peace knowing that Jehovah

00:53:39.606 --> 00:53:42.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in complete control.

00:53:42.567 --> 00:53:47.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
All in attendance will be pleased to know
that Parts 1 and 2

00:53:47.113 --> 00:53:51.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the drama-documentary
<i>Jehovah Guides Us in the Way of Peace</i>

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:56.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
are available now for download on jw.org

00:53:56.414 --> 00:53:59.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the <i>JW Library®</i>  app.

00:54:01.378 --> 00:54:03.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you enjoyed the original songs

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have been featured
at recent conventions?

00:54:06.216 --> 00:54:10.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now have the privilege
of watching a video medley

00:54:10.429 --> 00:54:12.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflecting on the lessons we have learned

00:54:12.806 --> 00:54:15.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
at our conventions over the past few years.

00:54:16.101 --> 00:54:17.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy!

00:54:35.287 --> 00:54:39.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doubt and fear surround me—

00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:44.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way ahead not clear.

00:54:44.505 --> 00:54:49.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through uncertainty you guide me;

00:54:49.676 --> 00:54:55.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re always near.

00:54:55.057 --> 00:54:59.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life may not be easy,

00:54:59.561 --> 00:55:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this I know is true:

00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:09.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re the God who’s ever loyal;

00:55:09.822 --> 00:55:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life is safe with you.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me eyes of faith

00:55:20.249 --> 00:55:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
And help me always see

00:55:24.879 --> 00:55:29.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are more with us than against us.

00:55:29.967 --> 00:55:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courageous let me be.

00:55:35.556 --> 00:55:39.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage, give me courage;

00:55:39.852 --> 00:55:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
With courage, I’ll endure.

00:55:45.274 --> 00:55:50.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me courage;

00:55:50.321 --> 00:55:56.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your victory is sure.

00:55:58.579 --> 00:56:02.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feeling fear is human.

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:07.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my own strength, I’m frail.

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:13.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have been my rock and refuge;

00:56:13.094 --> 00:56:18.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your power never fails.

00:56:18.433 --> 00:56:23.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help me be courageous,

00:56:23.229 --> 00:56:27.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let my heart be brave.

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:33.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lasting harm can never hold me—

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:38.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
No prison, gate, or grave.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:43.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me eyes of faith

00:56:43.625 --> 00:56:48.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
And help me always see

00:56:48.296 --> 00:56:53.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are more with us than against us.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:58.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courageous let me be.

00:56:58.974 --> 00:57:03.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Courage, give me courage;

00:57:03.395 --> 00:57:08.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
With courage, I’ll endure.

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, give me courage;

00:57:15.157 --> 00:57:23.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your victory is sure.

00:57:32.132 --> 00:57:34.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look around us now;

00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:38.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
See the love on each face—

00:57:38.847 --> 00:57:45.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out there in the world, hard to find.

00:57:45.604 --> 00:57:48.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these faithful friends

00:57:48.857 --> 00:57:52.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the love they all show,

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Glad to leave that old world behind.

00:58:00.619 --> 00:58:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love never fails; that’s promised.

00:58:07.585 --> 00:58:13.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
It always will endure.

00:58:13.049 --> 00:58:18.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:58:18.179 --> 00:58:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Jehovah gives.

00:58:22.892 --> 00:58:26.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he is.

00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:32.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:58:32.068 --> 00:58:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we need to live.

00:58:36.739 --> 00:58:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the love here today,

00:58:40.243 --> 00:58:49.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our heart may it stay—

00:58:49.168 --> 00:58:54.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:58:54.382 --> 00:58:59.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Jehovah gives.

00:58:59.178 --> 00:59:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he is.

00:59:02.765 --> 00:59:07.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love—unfailing love—

00:59:07.896 --> 00:59:12.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we need to live.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:16.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the love here today,

00:59:16.279 --> 00:59:23.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our heart may it stay—

00:59:23.954 --> 00:59:27.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love,

00:59:30.877 --> 00:59:34.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love,

00:59:37.759 --> 00:59:42.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love.

00:59:46.852 --> 00:59:51.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should I fear the lion?

00:59:53.608 --> 00:59:59.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should I fear any foe?

00:59:59.656 --> 01:00:03.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah by my side,

01:00:03.577 --> 01:00:07.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not run and hide.

01:00:07.039 --> 01:00:12.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
My God is with me; this I know.

01:00:12.961 --> 01:00:15.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

01:00:15.714 --> 01:00:19.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

01:00:19.843 --> 01:00:22.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

01:00:22.513 --> 01:00:27.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:31.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:34.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Determined to go on,

01:00:34.817 --> 01:00:40.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

01:00:40.531 --> 01:00:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith.

01:00:55.504 --> 01:01:02.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see the wondrous future

01:01:02.303 --> 01:01:08.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has in store for me.

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:12.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to be strong.

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:15.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know it won’t be long

01:01:15.191 --> 01:01:21.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Till Jehovah claims his victory.

01:01:21.531 --> 01:01:24.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

01:01:24.367 --> 01:01:28.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:31.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

01:01:31.165 --> 01:01:35.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:39.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

01:01:39.632 --> 01:01:43.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Determined to go on,

01:01:43.511 --> 01:01:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

01:01:52.645 --> 01:01:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith,

01:02:06.409 --> 01:02:14.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
With eyes of faith.

01:02:22.592 --> 01:02:25.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stars that fill the summer night

01:02:25.804 --> 01:02:29.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look down from above.

01:02:29.224 --> 01:02:32.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beauty of the day and night

01:02:32.769 --> 01:02:36.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
You fashioned with love.

01:02:36.106 --> 01:02:39.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your hands prepared the land and sea,

01:02:39.609 --> 01:02:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ev’rything that came to be

01:02:42.988 --> 01:02:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brought joy to your heart.

01:02:49.912 --> 01:02:53.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is joy in your creation,

01:02:53.165 --> 01:02:56.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the message of salvation,

01:02:56.502 --> 01:03:03.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:03:03.467 --> 01:03:06.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to have your love forever

01:03:06.804 --> 01:03:10.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:03:10.391 --> 01:03:17.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
You alone will prove to be

01:03:17.314 --> 01:03:21.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our joy eternally.

01:03:32.746 --> 01:03:35.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
This joy could not be ours

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:39.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the gift of your Son.

01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:43.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
His sacrifice has paid the price

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:49.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
So joy could be ours for all time.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is joy in your creation,

01:03:53.226 --> 01:03:56.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the message of salvation,

01:03:56.687 --> 01:04:03.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:04:03.444 --> 01:04:06.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to have your love forever

01:04:06.906 --> 01:04:10.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:04:10.493 --> 01:04:17.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
You alone will prove to be

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:22.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our joy eternally.

01:04:30.138 --> 01:04:32.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next song encourages us

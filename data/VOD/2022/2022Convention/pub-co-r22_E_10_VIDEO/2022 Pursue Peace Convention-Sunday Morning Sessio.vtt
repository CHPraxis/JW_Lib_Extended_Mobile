WEBVTT

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
We extend a warm welcome
to all who accepted an invitation

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:28.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
to join us for this convention.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live in an unfriendly world

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:35.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
where true friends are hard to find.

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:39.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it possible to draw close to God
and have him as our Friend?

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:44.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, what must we do
to gain God’s friendship?

00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:52.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
will answer those questions
in the discourse entitled

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Friendship With God—How Possible?”

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:09.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it realistic to believe
that you can be a friend of God?

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
If until now you’ve answered no
to that question,

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:14.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
please consider this:

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:16.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lives of millions of people today

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:20.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
prove that friendship with God is possible.

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:25.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their lives prove that we can find
a peaceful and meaningful life now,

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as hope
for an everlasting and peaceful future.

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:32.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you desire that for yourself and others,

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
we urge you
to listen to this Scriptural talk.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
We emphasize the need to listen

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:42.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
because many people ignore
that important question,

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:46.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, Can you be a friend of God?

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:50.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it that many put
such an important question out of their mind?

00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:52.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are a number of reasons.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:57.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, some believe
that God is impersonal or unknowable

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:01.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that he does not exist
and that he’s not interested in humans.

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:04.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are taught that God is a mystery

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he’s cruel, harsh, and demanding.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:12.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many religious leaders claim
that God will punish bad people forever

00:02:12.656 --> 00:02:14.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a place of torment.

00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:18.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel drawn into friendship
with a God like that?

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind would?

00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:23.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still other people, after seeing

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the injustice and suffering
in the world,

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
have concluded that God must be dead

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:32.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that he never existed at all.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then there are those who believe

00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:36.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they have done
too many bad things in their life

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ever be a friend of God.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:45.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do any of those causes for doubt or concern
apply to you?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, please listen carefully
to the following four key points

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:54.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may help you to see
that friendship with God is truly possible.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will then develop each one.

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:02.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll look at how sin
separates us from God.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we’ll look at how God
has taken the initiative to heal the breach

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:11.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring obedient humans
back into friendship with him.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, we’ll examine what we can do

00:03:14.553 --> 00:03:18.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become God’s friend in an everlasting way.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:22.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, we will consider
how friendship with God

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings peace now and in the future.

00:03:25.814 --> 00:03:28.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for our first point:

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it that separates us from God?

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:34.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a word, sin.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does sin separate us?

00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:41.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the true God is holy, he’s pure,

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:43.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his conduct is perfect.

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not have a trace of sin;
he’s clean in the highest sense.

00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:52.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
No human can be holy to that degree,

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:54.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even close.

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate: Consider the words
“human” and “imperfect.”

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
They go together, don’t they?

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot fully describe humans
without mentioning imperfection.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just a part of us,

00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:11.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and human history shows this
to be sadly and painfully true.

00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:14.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then our sins or imperfections

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:18.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
create a barrier between us and God.

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:20.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
This separation is described

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:24.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 59:2,

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we are told in part:

00:04:27.294 --> 00:04:30.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your own errors have separated you
from your God.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:35.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your sins have made him
hide his face from you.”

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:38.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Separated from God,’ it says.

00:04:38.764 --> 00:04:41.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were born into this state,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
but God did not create us to be sinful.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sins are not his fault.

00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:51.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first humans, Adam and Eve,
were created perfect.

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:55.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they proved to be ungrateful and selfish,

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:58.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they rejected God’s friendship.

00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:02.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
They destroyed their peace with God
by sinning against him,

00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they became his enemies.

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam then passed sin on

00:05:07.794 --> 00:05:10.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his descendants, as well as death.

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:12.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read about this terrible inheritance

00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:17.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 5:12.

00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:21.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this verse, the apostle Paul summarizes

00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:25.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
why our inherited sinful condition
leads to death.

00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:29.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote:
“That is why, just as through one man

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:33.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sin entered into the world
and death through sin,

00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:36.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and so death spread to all men

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:39.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death spread to all men.”

00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:45.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pandemic of sin

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:48.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a 100 percent infection rate

00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a 100 percent mortality rate.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
No human can escape it.

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:56.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Paul said: “Death spread . . .

00:05:56.594 --> 00:05:59.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:03.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
On our own,
we cannot correct our sinful state.

00:06:03.893 --> 00:06:06.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as if we have fallen into a deep pit

00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:09.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
with seemingly no way out.

00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:11.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
But are we left without hope?

00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:12.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, although God views some people
as his enemies,

00:06:15.697 --> 00:06:18.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
he treats others as his friends.

00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:21.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, regarding the man Abraham,

00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:26.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible book of James
says in chapter 2 and verse 23

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:29.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it was counted to him as righteousness,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he came to be called Jehovah’s friend.”

00:06:37.135 --> 00:06:40.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham was as imperfect as we are,

00:06:40.722 --> 00:06:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he came to be called God’s friend.

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has God done
to make it possible for humans

00:06:46.603 --> 00:06:49.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain his favor and blessing?

00:06:49.982 --> 00:06:54.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply put, our Creator
has taken the initiative.

00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:58.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has taken steps to heal the breach
that was caused by sin

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to eliminate the separation
between us and him.

00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:04.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has he done this?

00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the Holy Scriptures tell us

00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:12.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God desires for us to come to know him
and to be at peace with him.

00:07:12.338 --> 00:07:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he appeals to us to do this.

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible book of Acts 17:27,

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:23.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are told that God wants us
to sincerely seek him

00:07:23.975 --> 00:07:25.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that if we do,

00:07:25.852 --> 00:07:30.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will find that “he is not far off
from each one of us.”

00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:32.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, and very important,

00:07:32.817 --> 00:07:35.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
God took the initiative to make this possible

00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:39.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
by providing the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus,

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:42.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to redeem us from sin.

00:07:42.702 --> 00:07:47.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was an unparalleled act of love.

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:51.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we now read 1 John 4:10,

00:07:51.712 --> 00:07:53.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
please think about what it says

00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:58.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding this matchless act of love
on God’s part

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:02.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we may never forget
that God took the initiative

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
to heal the breach, so to speak.

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:07.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 4:10 says:

00:08:07.227 --> 00:08:09.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The love is in this respect,

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:12.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not that we have loved God,

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that he loved us

00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:18.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice

00:08:18.656 --> 00:08:20.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our sins.”

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:22.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did God do?

00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:25.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God . . . loved us,” it says,

00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:27.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and [he] sent his Son.”

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:31.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
This sacrifice that God provided
by means of his Son

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:35.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called “propitiatory”
because it can atone for our sins.

00:08:35.924 --> 00:08:38.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here is how it can do so:

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:41.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Jesus gave in sacrifice for us

00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:44.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
was equal to what Adam lost for us,

00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:47.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, a perfect human life.

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:51.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam exchanged his perfect life for death

00:08:51.606 --> 00:08:54.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
by his rebellion against God.

00:08:54.443 --> 00:08:59.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
As mentioned earlier, Adam then
passed sin on to his descendants,

00:08:59.448 --> 00:09:04.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he placed us on a path
outside of God’s friendship.

00:09:04.202 --> 00:09:08.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
the death of Jesus allowed for a ransom,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a means to satisfy God’s justice

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could receive back
what Adam lost for us.

00:09:14.463 --> 00:09:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
That undeserved gift from God
was given at great cost.

00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:22.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, our Creator wants us
to come to know him

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:26.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to enjoy a beautiful friendship with him.

00:09:26.308 --> 00:09:30.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be very grateful
that God took the necessary step

00:09:30.563 --> 00:09:34.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
to close the gap
and provide a way for us

00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:37.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become his friend.

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:39.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next step involves each of us.

00:09:39.864 --> 00:09:41.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is required of us?

00:09:41.866 --> 00:09:42.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility.

00:09:42.992 --> 00:09:47.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must be humble enough
to accept God’s gift.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are humble, we’ll see
our need for God’s mercy,

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:55.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll then do our part
to show appreciation.

00:09:55.755 --> 00:09:59.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Acts 3:19 tells us

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:04.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this involves
‘repenting and turning around.’

00:10:04.598 --> 00:10:09.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, to receive God’s gift,
which includes his mercy,

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:12.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must adjust our thinking by repenting

00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:16.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then turn around
by adjusting our conduct and course in life

00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:18.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever necessary.

00:10:18.695 --> 00:10:22.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opportunity to do this
is open to all people.

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our Creator,
God is not partial in his mercy

00:10:26.328 --> 00:10:28.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the friendship he offers.

00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:31.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has kindly put everything in place for us.

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:35.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
All we must do is be grateful and humble

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:38.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take the next step.

00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:43.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
That step involves accepting Jesus
and his teachings.

00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:47.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
God requires that we follow
the example of his Son.

00:10:47.475 --> 00:10:49.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
How closely must we do so?

00:10:49.894 --> 00:10:54.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 14:6, Jesus explained:

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:58.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:10:58.736 --> 00:11:02.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one comes to the Father
except through me.”

00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:04.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No one.”

00:11:04.743 --> 00:11:07.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, to come into God’s friendship,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must follow his Son as true Christians.

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:17.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far, we have reviewed
how sin separated humans from God.

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:22.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we considered what God has done
to heal the breach, or close the gap,

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:26.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can come back
into his favor as his friends.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s look even further
into what we must do,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
which brings us to the third key point:

00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:36.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can a person become God’s friend?

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to consider what is said

00:11:38.652 --> 00:11:42.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
at James 4:8.

00:11:42.323 --> 00:11:46.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a copy of the Bible,
we urge you to follow along

00:11:46.702 --> 00:11:49.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
—James 4:8.

00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:54.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read it,
please notice first the invitation,

00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:56.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the response,

00:11:56.671 --> 00:11:59.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finally what we must do.

00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:01.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads:

00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:06.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Draw close to God,
and he will draw close to you.

00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:08.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Cleanse your hands, you sinners,

00:12:08.558 --> 00:12:12.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.”

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, first, what is the invitation?

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:18.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is to “draw close to God.”

00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:21.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is followed
by what response on God’s part?

00:12:21.655 --> 00:12:24.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will draw close to you.”

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:26.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for God to do this, what must we do

00:12:26.952 --> 00:12:29.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show that we accept his invitation?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must cleanse and purify ourselves
according to his standards.

00:12:34.835 --> 00:12:37.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will take effort.

00:12:37.713 --> 00:12:40.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we must learn about his standards,

00:12:40.674 --> 00:12:44.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we must come to appreciate
that they are the best for us,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we must be determined
to follow them.

00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all, we do this
because we want to please God

00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:54.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be his friend.

00:12:54.522 --> 00:12:57.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, how can you develop
a friendship with God?

00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:01.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show initiative and put forth the effort.

00:13:01.153 --> 00:13:03.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this: If you have a houseplant,

00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:05.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know that it doesn’t grow on its own.

00:13:05.992 --> 00:13:08.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to water it regularly

00:13:08.077 --> 00:13:10.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep it in an environment
that helps it to grow.

00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:12.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
True?

00:13:12.206 --> 00:13:16.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something similar is true
of our friendship with God.

00:13:16.461 --> 00:13:21.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
We nurture this friendship by reading
and studying God’s Word, the Bible.

00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:24.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do so,
we learn important things about God.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we learn that God’s name is Jehovah.

00:13:29.224 --> 00:13:31.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as is true of any good friendship,

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:35.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s important that we use his name.

00:13:35.355 --> 00:13:39.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re sincere in our efforts
to “draw close” to him,

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:42.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we read at James 4:8,

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:45.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “draw close” to us.

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:49.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he never abandons his true friends.

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:54.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, John 17:3 tells us
that coming to know God

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“means everlasting life” for us.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:01.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an undeserved kindness
and priceless gift

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:04.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s true friends!

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:08.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that you too can enjoy
a bright future as God’s friends,

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:13.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
we warmly invite you to accept
a free interactive Bible course

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
offered by Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:20.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the publication <i>Enjoy life Forever! </i>

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what it looks like.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:26.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses can help you
to get either a printed

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an electronic copy.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It begins with the lessons:

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Can the Bible Help You?”

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Bible Gives Hope,”

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Can You Trust the Bible?”

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
We urge you to learn these things

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to worship God in harmony with the truth

00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:47.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is revealed in his Word.

00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:49.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what important points have we considered

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:53.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding how a person
can become God’s friend?

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, get to know God
by reading and studying his Word.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that doing this
“means everlasting life.”

00:15:01.485 --> 00:15:03.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then,

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn about God’s name and use it.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’ll list four more things

00:15:08.826 --> 00:15:12.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
that those who desire
to become God’s friends must do.

00:15:12.872 --> 00:15:16.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are: imitate God’s qualities,

00:15:16.292 --> 00:15:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
reject thinking and actions that offend God,

00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:23.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
associate with those
who want to be God’s friend,

00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:26.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid friendship with people

00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:29.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
who ignore or mock God’s standards.

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:32.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a few things in that list
speak for themselves—don’t they?—

00:15:32.684 --> 00:15:36.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as associate with those
who want to be God’s friend

00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:40.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid friendship with people
who ignore or mock God’s standards.

00:15:40.442 --> 00:15:42.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes sense, doesn’t it?

00:15:42.152 --> 00:15:45.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to our illustration
about the houseplant.

00:15:45.905 --> 00:15:48.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
You must not only water and nurture it,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you must keep it
in the right environment,

00:15:51.244 --> 00:15:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that helps it to grow.

00:15:53.455 --> 00:15:57.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, associating with those
who also want to be God’s friend

00:15:57.876 --> 00:16:01.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the right environment for us.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the requirement
to imitate God’s qualities?

00:16:05.217 --> 00:16:08.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can imperfect people do this?

00:16:08.387 --> 00:16:11.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for a few minutes,
we’ll look at just two of God’s qualities

00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:14.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can imitate him.

00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:17.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will begin with God’s love.

00:16:18.606 --> 00:16:22.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
An important way that we can imitate
God’s love and become his friend

00:16:22.693 --> 00:16:26.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by applying what his Son, Jesus,
taught us.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Jesus said:

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:31.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as you want men to do to you,

00:16:31.035 --> 00:16:34.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
do the same way to them”

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a simple statement
but one that takes effort to apply, true?

00:16:38.543 --> 00:16:39.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we do this?

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:40.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a person who desires to be God’s friend

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:47.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
will put forth the effort needed to do this.

00:16:47.093 --> 00:16:49.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
To succeed in imitating God’s love,

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:53.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must try to see people
as Jehovah sees them.

00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:56.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must try to put ourselves
in the place of others

00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:00.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can understand
their needs, their concerns,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even their pain of heart.

00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:07.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may be challenged physically
because of injury, disease, or aging.

00:17:07.864 --> 00:17:10.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others are coping with emotional trials

00:17:10.158 --> 00:17:13.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of depression or anxiety.

00:17:13.662 --> 00:17:17.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people face difficulties
that we have not experienced.

00:17:17.916 --> 00:17:20.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, a young person
may find it hard

00:17:20.294 --> 00:17:22.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand older people,

00:17:22.796 --> 00:17:26.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he or she will really need to think
about what it must be like

00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be an older person.

00:17:28.469 --> 00:17:33.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is true of you,
how can you imitate God’s love?

00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:36.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
One important way is by listening carefully

00:17:36.894 --> 00:17:40.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
until you understand
the other person’s feelings.

00:17:40.398 --> 00:17:43.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you do so, you are in a better position

00:17:43.568 --> 00:17:46.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
to imitate God’s love.

00:17:46.154 --> 00:17:48.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who desire to be Jehovah’s friends

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be moved to imitate his love

00:17:51.534 --> 00:17:55.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
by acting according
to what others really need.

00:17:55.705 --> 00:17:59.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to a second
and related quality,

00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:01.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of kindness.

00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:06.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone who desires to be God’s friend
must be kind to others.

00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:10.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here again, we can learn much
from what Jesus said and did.

00:18:10.512 --> 00:18:13.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Son said that the Most High

00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:17.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.”

00:18:17.102 --> 00:18:21.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus appreciated this outstanding quality
of his heavenly Father,

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:24.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he imitated God’s kindness.

00:18:24.526 --> 00:18:27.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Jesus to do so?

00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:30.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
He treated people in a kind manner

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
by anticipating how his words and actions

00:18:33.452 --> 00:18:35.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
might affect their feelings.

00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:37.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the Bible tells us

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a woman known to be a sinner
approached Jesus,

00:18:41.168 --> 00:18:45.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
weeping and wetting his feet with her tears.

00:18:45.506 --> 00:18:48.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus discerned that she was repentant,

00:18:48.634 --> 00:18:51.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knew how heartbroken she would be

00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:54.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he just dismissed her unkindly.

00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:59.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like his heavenly Father,
Jesus looked for the good in her.

00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:02.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know this because he commended her;

00:19:02.273 --> 00:19:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he forgave her.

00:19:05.652 --> 00:19:07.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following Jesus’ example,

00:19:07.654 --> 00:19:11.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we also imitate God’s kindness?

00:19:11.449 --> 00:19:16.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do so by being gentle to all people
whenever possible.

00:19:16.454 --> 00:19:21.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind people discern
how to deal with delicate situations.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind people avoid hurting
the feelings of others.

00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:28.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do this, we try to anticipate

00:19:28.508 --> 00:19:31.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
how our words and actions might affect them.

00:19:31.762 --> 00:19:36.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how a true friend of God
will treat others.

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:42.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this review of just a few
of Jehovah’s many outstanding qualities

00:19:42.022 --> 00:19:46.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us an idea of how much we can benefit
from reading the Bible

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:50.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then applying its many lessons for us.

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:53.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, friendship with God is possible,

00:19:53.617 --> 00:19:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can imitate his outstanding qualities.

00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:03.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
please take note of how we can use the Bible

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a friendship with God.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wanted to ask God:

00:20:19.602 --> 00:20:21.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who are you?

00:20:21.729 --> 00:20:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where are you?

00:20:23.773 --> 00:20:25.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you care about me?”

00:20:27.277 --> 00:20:29.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:31.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
For centuries,

00:20:31.281 --> 00:20:33.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
people everywhere have felt the need

00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:36.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know their Maker.

00:20:39.623 --> 00:20:43.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a woman
who has never known her father.

00:20:46.255 --> 00:20:50.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
All her life she has been told lies
that her father abandoned her.

00:20:55.139 --> 00:20:58.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
But deep inside she feels
—she knows—

00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:00.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not true.

00:21:03.147 --> 00:21:06.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,
she receives a letter from her father.

00:21:11.864 --> 00:21:15.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
She learns that he is alive
and that, unbeknownst to her,

00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:18.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had been reaching out
to be part of her life

00:21:18.413 --> 00:21:20.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
since the day she was born.

00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:25.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
The daughter learns who her father is,

00:21:32.093 --> 00:21:35.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:38.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
she finds him.

00:21:52.823 --> 00:21:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learn about one another

00:21:55.158 --> 00:21:57.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build a strong bond

00:21:57.786 --> 00:22:00.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they are inseparable friends.

00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is like a group

00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:08.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
of letters from our heavenly Father.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the Bible,

00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:16.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn how to talk to God,

00:22:16.972 --> 00:22:19.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he responds,

00:22:21.227 --> 00:22:23.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the many ways

00:22:23.354 --> 00:22:26.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
he shows his tender care.

00:22:29.569 --> 00:22:31.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible can help us to do something

00:22:31.738 --> 00:22:34.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may never have thought possible

00:22:36.868 --> 00:22:39.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
—be God’s friend.

00:22:39.996 --> 00:22:42.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
That friendship starts by learning the name

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:45.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your heavenly Father and new Friend,

00:22:45.627 --> 00:22:47.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and God tells us his name:

00:22:49.756 --> 00:22:53.927 line:10% position:50% align:center
“You, whose name is Jehovah,

00:22:53.927 --> 00:22:57.597 line:10% position:50% align:center
you alone are the Most High.”

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah guarantees that if you

00:23:04.354 --> 00:23:06.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘draw close to him,

00:23:06.815 --> 00:23:09.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will draw close to you.’

00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:13.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Father openly extends friendship

00:23:13.947 --> 00:23:16.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all who search for him.

00:23:17.534 --> 00:23:21.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you accept his invitation?

00:23:25.793 --> 00:23:28.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
To learn more about what the Bible says

00:23:28.254 --> 00:23:31.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this and many other topics,

00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:34.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to jw.org.

00:23:38.347 --> 00:23:41.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
As that thought-provoking video asked,

00:23:41.768 --> 00:23:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you see the need
to come to know your Creator?

00:23:46.022 --> 00:23:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you willing to put forth
the effort needed

00:23:48.525 --> 00:23:53.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept his invitation
and become his friend?

00:23:53.154 --> 00:23:58.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, the Bible contains
the guidance that you need,

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:01.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reward for applying what it says

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:04.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not reserved for the future only.

00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:08.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friendship with God brings peace now.

00:24:08.587 --> 00:24:12.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can have a more peaceful
and meaningful life right now

00:24:12.716 --> 00:24:15.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
by becoming Jehovah’s friend.

00:24:15.802 --> 00:24:19.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you become a friend of God,
he will listen to your prayers

00:24:19.389 --> 00:24:21.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
and extend his mercy to you.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you sense his forgiveness,

00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:27.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will experience deep-seated joy.

00:24:27.189 --> 00:24:30.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 32:1, 2 says in part:

00:24:30.234 --> 00:24:33.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy is the one
whose transgression is pardoned,

00:24:33.571 --> 00:24:35.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whose sin is covered.

00:24:35.448 --> 00:24:40.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Happy is the man
whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt.”

00:24:40.953 --> 00:24:45.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to sense Jehovah’s forgiveness!

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:49.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s forgiveness can free you
from the burden of guilt

00:24:49.462 --> 00:24:52.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you may feel because of past wrongs.

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:55.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes wrongs
that you may have committed

00:24:55.051 --> 00:24:58.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
before you came to know God
and became his friend.

00:24:58.721 --> 00:25:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is such a thing possible for you?

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:25:02.892 --> 00:25:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our video pointed out,
the Bible teaches us how to pray to God

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:10.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how God responds to our prayers.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can be assured
that he will listen to your prayers,

00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:18.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
including your prayers
for his forgiveness and his help.

00:25:18.658 --> 00:25:21.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Proverbs 15:29 we read

00:25:21.328 --> 00:25:24.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
“hears the prayer of the righteous.”

00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:26.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who are the righteous?

00:25:26.708 --> 00:25:31.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
The righteous are those who strive
to live by his requirements.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a comfort for us to know
that we can be God’s friend,

00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he sees what we are trying to do

00:25:38.387 --> 00:25:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he listens to us!

00:25:40.556 --> 00:25:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is more.

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:47.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our friendship with God can also result
in peace with other people.

00:25:47.313 --> 00:25:51.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus urged us
to seek such peace with others.

00:25:51.943 --> 00:25:54.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that we should ‘love even our enemies

00:25:54.779 --> 00:25:58.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do good to others
without hoping for anything back.’

00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:02.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we read at Luke 6:36 that he added:

00:26:02.161 --> 00:26:04.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue being merciful,

00:26:04.247 --> 00:26:07.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as your Father is merciful.”

00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such a good example
can touch the hearts of others

00:26:12.088 --> 00:26:16.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move them
to become Jehovah’s friends as well.

00:26:16.968 --> 00:26:19.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the experience of José,

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:24.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
who learned how to love
from true friends of God.

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the age of 13, José was involved
in guerrilla warfare.

00:26:29.064 --> 00:26:33.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was taught to hate the people
who were allegedly responsible

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the injustices
that he saw all around him.

00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:39.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
His aim was to eliminate those people.

00:26:39.742 --> 00:26:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw many of his companions fall in death,

00:26:43.412 --> 00:26:46.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and José became filled
with feelings of bitterness

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and revenge.

00:26:48.792 --> 00:26:52.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
While making grenades or bombs,
he would ask himself:

00:26:52.463 --> 00:26:54.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why is there so much suffering?

00:26:54.757 --> 00:26:57.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there is a God, does he even notice?’

00:26:57.843 --> 00:27:00.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times, José wept.

00:27:00.221 --> 00:27:03.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was depressed and confused.

00:27:03.349 --> 00:27:05.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, José came in contact

00:27:05.643 --> 00:27:09.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a local congregation
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:11.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
At his first congregation meeting,

00:27:11.524 --> 00:27:14.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
he noticed the loving atmosphere there.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone greeted him
in a warm and friendly manner.

00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:20.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, a discussion on the subject

00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:23.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why Does God Permit Wickedness?”

00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:28.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided answers to the very questions
that he had been asking.

00:27:28.124 --> 00:27:31.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he learned more from the Bible,
José made changes

00:27:31.294 --> 00:27:33.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his way of life and in his thinking.

00:27:33.964 --> 00:27:36.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned to imitate God’s love

00:27:36.341 --> 00:27:39.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby become his friend.

00:27:39.052 --> 00:27:43.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Breaking his ties with his companions,
though, proved to be challenging.

00:27:43.265 --> 00:27:46.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time he went
to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was followed.

00:27:48.604 --> 00:27:51.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some former associates
even attended a few meetings

00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:56.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
so as to understand what brought about
such a great change in José.

00:27:56.236 --> 00:27:59.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
But once they were satisfied
that he was not a danger to them,

00:27:59.823 --> 00:28:01.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
they left him alone.

00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:06.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
At age 17, José was baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:28:06.497 --> 00:28:08.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
As God’s friend,

00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:12.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
José soon started sharing
what he was learning full-time.

00:28:12.503 --> 00:28:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of scheming to kill people,

00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could now share a message
of love and of hope with them.

00:28:19.469 --> 00:28:22.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great reward for choosing

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become Jehovah’s friend!

00:28:24.933 --> 00:28:27.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even those who were once enemies

00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:29.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
can learn to be at peace with one another

00:28:29.979 --> 00:28:32.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be God’s friends.

00:28:32.774 --> 00:28:34.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned?

00:28:34.776 --> 00:28:37.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have reviewed why friendship with God

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
is realistic and possible for us.

00:28:40.448 --> 00:28:43.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible tells us that since ancient times,

00:28:43.618 --> 00:28:46.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has called some humans his friends.

00:28:46.997 --> 00:28:49.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also looked at what God has done

00:28:49.041 --> 00:28:53.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to heal the breach, or close the gap,
between us and him.

00:28:53.211 --> 00:28:54.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has he done so?

00:28:54.922 --> 00:28:57.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of his Son.

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Jesus, Jehovah God provided
the ransom sacrifice

00:29:02.096 --> 00:29:05.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was needed to redeem us from sin.

00:29:05.516 --> 00:29:08.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, we looked at what you must do
to take advantage

00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:10.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s mercy and become his friend.

00:29:10.855 --> 00:29:14.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes studying his Word, the Bible,

00:29:14.024 --> 00:29:18.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then imitating his outstanding qualities.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, we considered

00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:23.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
how you can find a meaningful life now,

00:29:23.242 --> 00:29:26.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as true peace with others.

00:29:26.788 --> 00:29:29.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises that his friends

00:29:29.707 --> 00:29:33.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive eternal life in peace.

00:29:33.086 --> 00:29:36.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is what you yearn for,

00:29:36.548 --> 00:29:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
then please accept our invitation

00:29:39.008 --> 00:29:43.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:29:43.054 --> 00:29:47.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, you will learn
about an unending future

00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:50.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
when anguish of heart is gone forever,

00:29:50.395 --> 00:29:52.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
an unending future

00:29:52.522 --> 00:29:55.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which God will permanently
wipe away tears

00:29:55.692 --> 00:29:58.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the faces of his friends.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
That future is not only possible,

00:30:01.782 --> 00:30:06.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is the future that God promises!

00:30:08.288 --> 00:30:10.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Cook,
for helping us to see

00:30:10.624 --> 00:30:14.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
how friendship with God
leads to genuine peace.

00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the earth, millions are pursuing peace

00:30:18.507 --> 00:30:22.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and building faith in Jehovah God
and his Word, the Bible.

00:30:42.699 --> 00:30:44.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, you can find

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:47.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
interactive, self-guided Bible study lessons

on our website, jw.org.

00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:55.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have reached the conclusion
of this session.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to the next session
in which we will see

00:30:58.298 --> 00:31:01.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
part two of our feature Bible drama,

00:31:01.218 --> 00:31:04.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Jehovah Guides Us in the Way of Peace,”</i>

00:31:04.012 --> 00:31:08.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will hear the final talk
of this convention.

00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:11.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s sing a song
that expresses our confidence

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:13.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s promises.

00:31:13.272 --> 00:31:18.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to sing
song number 147, entitled

00:31:18.277 --> 00:31:21.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Life Everlasting Is Promised.”

00:31:21.363 --> 00:31:24.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 147,

00:31:24.116 --> 00:31:27.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
after which you may have
your local concluding prayer.

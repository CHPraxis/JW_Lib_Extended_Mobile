00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot express

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:05.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
to you baptism candidates around the world

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:08.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much of a privilege it is for us

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in this occasion with you.

00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:13.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are following through
on the most important decision

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve ever made

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to make it known publicly

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have dedicated your life to God.

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know your situations vary.

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:28.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you candidates
were raised knowing about Jehovah,

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:32.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you had to develop your own
personal relationship with him.

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:35.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others of you may be taking this step

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
after learning about Jehovah more recently.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:41.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever your circumstances,

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely it was a journey

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:48.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a figurative road
you had to travel to get to this point.

00:00:48.987 --> 00:00:51.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the Bible also compares true worship

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:54.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a road, a path,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a walkway that has to be traveled.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 9:2,

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:04.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the first-century
Christian congregation was being established,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ disciples used the term “The Way”

00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:12.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
to designate their newly established
form of worship.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
They understood that as baptized Christians,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were walking on a new path

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:24.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every aspect of their lives was involved.

00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s going to be
the case for you as well.

00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:30.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, note how the Bible describes this.

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Ephesians.

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:38.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
And note what is stated
in Ephesians chapter 4,

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:43.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verses 22 through 24.

00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:56.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says: “You were taught
to put away the old personality

00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:59.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that conforms
to your formal course of conduct

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:03.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that is being corrupted
according to its deceptive desires.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:09.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in your dominant mental attitude,

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and should put on the new personality

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that was created according to God’s will

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:18.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
in true righteousness and loyalty.”

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like the first-century Christians,

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have come to know
the truth about Jehovah.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the things you’ve learned

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:29.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
have led you to become baptism candidates.

00:02:29.757 --> 00:02:31.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like all of God’s people,

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve done what verse 22 states,

00:02:34.095 --> 00:02:37.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“put away the old personality.”

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:40.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there in verse 23,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must also “continue to be made new

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
in [our] dominant mental attitude.”

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves our thoughts

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:55.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what we allow our mind to dwell on.

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:57.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know, the footnote for that verse

00:02:57.536 --> 00:02:59.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates this term could also be rendered

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:04.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the force actuating [our] mind”

00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:08.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
or literally translated
“to the spirit of your mind.”

00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:12.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the English language,

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps you’ve heard someone say
that they are in good spirits

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you’ve heard someone
described as being mean-spirited.

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:27.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a description
of one’s dominant mental attitude

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:30.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one’s thoughts and motivations.

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:34.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what moves us to act the way that we do.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal as baptized servants of Jehovah

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to gain a dominant mental attitude

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:47.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
that aligns and is in harmony

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:49.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
with God’s thoughts.

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:52.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that won’t always be easy.

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:56.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes time and a lot of effort.

00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:59.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who walk
in the way of peace

00:03:59.808 --> 00:04:01.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
often encounter trials.

00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:04.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to stay on that road,

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:08.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be willing to make sacrifices.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like some of those first-century Christians,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may have to endure direct persecution.

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we continue to walk in Jehovah’s way,

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:22.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to be happy

00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:25.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah is going to bless us.

00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:29.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 1:79, he assures us

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will “guide our feet
in the way of peace.”

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a comforting thought, isn’t it?

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re excited.

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re excited that you baptism candidates

00:04:42.477 --> 00:04:44.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
have undertaken this journey.

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:46.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that you have

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:51.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
some eight and a half million
other Witnesses on this road with you.

00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:53.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is our honor and privilege to welcome you

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:01.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to welcome you to Jehovah’s way of peace

00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “the road leading off into life.”

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:08.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we go through our discussion today,

00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:10.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to answer three questions.

00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:15.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, why is it important
that we do not give up

00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:18.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
on walking in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:20.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second,

00:05:20.808 --> 00:05:24.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does walking
in Jehovah’s way bring us peace?

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, what can we do

00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:32.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue walking
in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s address our first question:

00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:39.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it important that we do not give up

00:05:39.827 --> 00:05:43.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
on walking in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:45.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to answer that, let’s turn, please,

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:47.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:51.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll note

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:56.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Corinthians 4:16-18.

00:05:58.597 --> 00:06:00.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it reads:

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:04.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, we do not give up,

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:08.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but even if the man
we are outside is wasting away,

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:13.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“certainly the man we are inside
is being renewed from day to day.

00:06:13.028 --> 00:06:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For though the tribulation
is momentary and light,

00:06:16.365 --> 00:06:18.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it works out for us a glory

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is of more and more
surpassing greatness and is everlasting;

00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:25.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“while we keep our eyes,

00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:29.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not on the things seen,
but on the things unseen.

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the things seen are temporary,

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:36.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the things unseen are everlasting.”

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:41.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see why we can’t give up?

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:43.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires that we remain active

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persevere in the way of peace.

00:06:50.608 --> 00:06:54.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
You dear candidates have not given up
in your efforts to please Jehovah

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:58.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to qualify to become part of his people.

00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:00.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because of your love for him.

00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:08.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know that any trials
and obstacles you face now

00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:10.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
are “momentary and light”

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
when compared to an eternity
in God’s new world.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, you will enter
into a special relationship

00:07:19.304 --> 00:07:21.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah God.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:25.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
So don’t let anyone or anything

00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:27.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
jeopardize that relationship.

00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:31.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let it be something that you cherish

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:36.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that relationship is everlasting.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
So keep walking in Jehovah’s way of peace.

00:07:40.118 --> 00:07:43.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Focus on what it means
to have him as a Friend,

00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:47.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have him guiding your steps.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t give up,

00:07:49.252 --> 00:07:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
then despite any trials you face,

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:57.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will continue
to enjoy Jehovah’s blessings.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re confident that you can do so.

00:08:00.722 --> 00:08:03.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to highlight how this can be done,

00:08:03.892 --> 00:08:05.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this time,

00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:09.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re pleased to introduce
Sister Indira Alfonso.

00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:12.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Alfonso was baptized in 2006

00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:16.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now serves with her husband
as Bethel family members in Warwick.

00:08:18.157 --> 00:08:20.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Alfonso,

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:22.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you tell us a little about your journey,

00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:26.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
how you became associated
with Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:08:26.624 --> 00:08:28.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I was born in Cuba,

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my mom and I moved
to the United States when I was nine.

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:34.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was young,
I felt it was important to look for God.

00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:38.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whenever we moved,
I would visit the local churches in the area,

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:40.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
even getting baptized in a number of them.

00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:44.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was 11, my mom
let me move in with my aunt,

00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:46.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:49.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from there, she asked my mom
if I could study with a pioneer sister

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:52.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
from her congregation, and my mom agreed.

00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:55.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s nice to see
that even at a young age

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
you had a spiritual need.

00:08:57.447 --> 00:09:00.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
So during this time
leading up to your baptism

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:03.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:09:03.036 --> 00:09:06.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you encounter any trials
that threatened to make you give up?

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I did.
I made changes very quickly.

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:13.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stopped celebrating holidays
and stopped praying to idols.

00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:16.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these changes
were very strange to my mom

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just difficult for her to understand.

00:09:18.969 --> 00:09:21.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was really afraid
that I was being brainwashed.

00:09:21.847 --> 00:09:24.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after studying for several months,

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:26.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had me move back in with her,

00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:30.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
which meant the end of my studies
and no more attending meetings.

00:09:30.231 --> 00:09:32.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t long before my association

00:09:32.817 --> 00:09:35.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
was affecting my speech and my behavior.

00:09:35.444 --> 00:09:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found myself easily influenced
to even celebrate my birthday again.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could feel I was moving further away
from Jehovah instead of closer to him.

00:09:44.412 --> 00:09:46.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry to hear that, Sister Alfonso.

00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:49.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what helped you not to give up

00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:52.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to go on walking in the way of peace?

00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:55.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped me was the scripture
at Matthew 10:37,

00:09:55.423 --> 00:09:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jesus said:
“Whoever has greater affection for father

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:01.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
or mother than for me is not worthy of me.”

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that a peaceful
relationship with Jehovah

00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:06.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
might mean no peace with my family.

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:09.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I knew that if I were
to ever gain my mom,

00:10:09.396 --> 00:10:12.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to walk with Jehovah
the right way and not give up.

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:14.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one night, I prayed to him,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
crying for forgiveness
and asking for his help.

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:21.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to my surprise,
a few days later without any explanation,

00:10:21.617 --> 00:10:24.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mom had me move back in with my aunt.

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:26.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I resumed my Bible studies,

00:10:26.705 --> 00:10:30.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a year later
at the age of 15, I got baptized.

00:10:30.793 --> 00:10:34.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah clearly heard
and answered your prayer.

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:38.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then, have you seen
continued evidence of Jehovah’s guidance?

00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:43.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good friend helped me to adjust the way
I was communicating with my mom.

00:10:43.055 --> 00:10:47.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one day, I called her and expressed to her
how much I truly appreciate and love her.

00:10:47.977 --> 00:10:50.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want us to be distant anymore.

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:54.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
I explained to her
that my love for her had never changed,

00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:57.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my love for Jehovah had come first.

00:10:57.737 --> 00:11:00.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that conversation
was a turning point for us.

00:11:00.907 --> 00:11:03.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we have had many positive discussions,

00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:06.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s much more understanding
of my decision.

00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:08.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing Jehovah’s guidance in my life

00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:11.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes me determined
to continue walking in his way of peace.

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:14.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Sister Alfonso.

00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:17.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate
your faithful example and comments.

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:23.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s address our second point.

00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:28.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does walking in Jehovah’s way
bring us peace?

00:11:28.602 --> 00:11:32.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to answer this,
we’re going to compare the path,

00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:35.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
or journey, you’ve taken on the road to life

00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:38.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a literal road, or walkway.

00:11:38.737 --> 00:11:43.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in making this comparison,
we find a number of similarities.

00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:48.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, both roads have boundaries,

00:11:48.205 --> 00:11:53.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
a purpose, and a destination.

00:11:53.085 --> 00:11:56.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s start
with that first one: boundaries.

00:11:56.547 --> 00:12:00.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a literal road, we may see “Yield”

00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:02.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Do Not Enter” signs,

00:12:02.303 --> 00:12:04.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
guardrails on the side of the road,

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:08.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
or lines on the road
to help us stay in our lane.

00:12:08.935 --> 00:12:11.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those are boundaries.

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those boundaries
are there for our protection

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:17.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if we step outside of them,

00:12:17.694 --> 00:12:20.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
we risk getting hurt or lost.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:25.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be great if we could tell you

00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:29.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
that as you continue
on the road to life after your baptism,

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:33.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would love to say that the rest
of your journey is smooth sailing.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:35.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have nothing but safe travels.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the reality is

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:45.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will face challenges
and tests of your faith.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil will make sure of it.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will make sure
that you are confronted

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
with temptations.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to do whatever he can

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:59.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
to damage
your special relationship with Jehovah.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re confident that you can succeed.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:07.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be successful and avoid danger

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:10.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you remain within the boundaries

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s way of peace.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:16.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do you stay
within those boundaries?

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:20.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
By continuing to learn
about Jehovah’s laws

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:24.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and principles and obeying them.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:28.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
That obedience will not only protect you,

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:31.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it will give you inner peace

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:34.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peace that comes
from having a clean conscience.

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:39.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next similarity between a literal road

00:13:39.403 --> 00:13:42.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being on the road to life
that we’ll discuss

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:45.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
is having a purpose.

00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:48.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we travel on a literal road,

00:13:48.496 --> 00:13:51.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
our plan usually is not to get on the road

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:56.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just stand still (to become stationary)

00:13:56.254 --> 00:14:00.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
or watch other people or vehicles go by.

00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:02.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we’re there for a reason.

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:06.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose of the road
is to enable movement

00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:10.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to help us get from one place to another.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar sense,
being on Jehovah’s way of peace

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows you to move forward,

00:14:18.193 --> 00:14:22.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make continual spiritual progress.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, there are many ways
that we can make spiritual advancement.

00:14:26.952 --> 00:14:31.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
One important way
that all Christians can do so

00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:35.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by cultivating spiritual qualities.

00:14:35.002 --> 00:14:37.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is so pleasing to Jehovah.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider with me, for example,

00:14:39.882 --> 00:14:42.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 6:10.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what’s mentioned here
at Galatians chapter 6,

00:14:51.477 --> 00:14:53.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 10.

00:14:53.521 --> 00:14:58.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “So, then, as long as we
have the opportunity,

00:14:58.109 --> 00:15:01.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let us work what is good toward all,

00:15:01.362 --> 00:15:06.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially toward those
related to us in the faith.”

00:15:07.827 --> 00:15:10.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one way to advance spiritually

00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:14.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to look for ways
to do good things for others,

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:19.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
both inside and outside the congregation.

00:15:19.798 --> 00:15:24.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pandemic has afforded us
many opportunities to do this.

00:15:24.344 --> 00:15:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been able to call and check on others

00:15:26.972 --> 00:15:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and distribute food or supplies when needed.

00:15:29.766 --> 00:15:31.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think of what our brothers

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
have done time and again to assist others

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
during natural disasters.

00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:42.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take a minute and think
about your local area.

00:15:42.696 --> 00:15:47.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you work what is good toward all?

00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:50.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are there ones
that need assistance getting food

00:15:50.955 --> 00:15:53.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
or running errands?

00:15:53.207 --> 00:15:55.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there someone who could use

00:15:55.543 --> 00:16:00.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
a good word of encouragement
to cheer them up?

00:16:00.297 --> 00:16:04.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we know individuals
who have lost loved ones in death

00:16:04.051 --> 00:16:07.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom we could share words of comfort

00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:11.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe simply provide a listening ear?

00:16:11.142 --> 00:16:15.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, by displaying spiritual qualities

00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:17.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities such as kindness,

00:16:17.106 --> 00:16:20.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
compassion, hospitality, generosity—

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to feel deeply rewarded

00:16:24.364 --> 00:16:26.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
for doing these things.

00:16:26.616 --> 00:16:29.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re pleasing Jehovah

00:16:29.703 --> 00:16:32.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you will show that your purpose

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being on the road to life

00:16:34.374 --> 00:16:38.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not just to save yourself

00:16:38.003 --> 00:16:40.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to help others.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there was a third similarity
between being on a literal road

00:16:45.552 --> 00:16:47.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being on the road to life.

00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:49.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
In both cases,

00:16:49.723 --> 00:16:52.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a destination

00:16:52.518 --> 00:16:55.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we want to reach.

00:16:55.145 --> 00:17:00.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling on a literal path
will eventually take you to your destination.

00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:02.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a Witness of Jehovah,

00:17:02.153 --> 00:17:06.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
our journey, our walk,
on this figurative road

00:17:06.324 --> 00:17:09.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
will lead us to our destination

00:17:09.744 --> 00:17:14.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the goal of enjoying
a peaceful friendship with God forever.

00:17:16.584 --> 00:17:19.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we long for that time
in God’s new world,

00:17:19.837 --> 00:17:24.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
even now we can experience
the blessings and inner peace

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:28.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
that come from a life of service to Jehovah.

00:17:30.724 --> 00:17:34.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now have the privilege
to speak with Sister Gloria Herd.

00:17:34.477 --> 00:17:37.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Herd has been baptized
for over 70 years

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:42.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has enjoyed a rich spiritual life
in special full-time service

00:17:42.527 --> 00:17:46.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
with her husband,
Brother Samuel Herd of the Governing Body.

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:52.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Herd, you’ve had
many rich spiritual blessings,

00:17:52.246 --> 00:17:56.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know that you’ve encountered
challenges along the way.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:18:00.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as you’ve carried out
these assignments through the years,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking in Jehovah’s way of peace,

00:18:03.591 --> 00:18:07.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
how have you managed
to enjoy greater inner peace?

00:18:07.595 --> 00:18:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned, Brother Turner,
that if Jehovah gives you an assignment,

00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:14.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will give you what you need to fulfill it.

00:18:14.477 --> 00:18:19.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned and really benefited
from the traveling overseers and their wives.

00:18:19.107 --> 00:18:22.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such a privilege to serve along
with these faithful brothers and sisters,

00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:27.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
and several of them had served me
and my family when I was very young.

00:18:27.115 --> 00:18:30.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to see their faithfulness,
to see their happiness,

00:18:30.744 --> 00:18:34.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see that they really had inner peace

00:18:34.164 --> 00:18:36.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
really benefited me.

00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:39.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned from that,
and I wanted to follow their example.

00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:42.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
That help from others can be so valuable.

00:18:42.464 --> 00:18:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
How else have you managed?

00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:48.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve enjoyed inner peace too
from praying to Jehovah a lot.

00:18:48.845 --> 00:18:52.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times we had
very little money or no money,

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:54.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we never missed a meal,

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:57.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we never missed any theocratic event.

00:18:57.813 --> 00:19:01.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned that having no money

00:19:01.025 --> 00:19:03.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not an obstacle to Jehovah.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
He heard our prayers, he answered them,

00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:10.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was as if the blessing
sometimes just fell out of heaven.

00:19:11.452 --> 00:19:13.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer can be so powerful.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:15.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:18.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how has walking
in Jehovah’s way of peace

00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:20.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped you to have peace with others?

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worked and lived with many sisters,

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they all had different personalities.

00:19:26.843 --> 00:19:30.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I learned that I had
to apply Romans 12:18,

00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:33.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says:
“As far as it depends [upon me],

00:19:33.808 --> 00:19:36.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
be peaceable with all men [and women].”

00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:40.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I learned that I have to adjust

00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:44.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
my personality sometimes to keep peace.

00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:47.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
This happened very often.

00:19:47.364 --> 00:19:52.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one time, we moved in
with a sister on Tuesday morning,

00:19:52.286 --> 00:19:55.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and something I said upset her very much.

00:19:55.998 --> 00:19:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
She got very angry.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I decided not to pursue the issue

00:20:01.295 --> 00:20:03.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I had to live with her for a week.

00:20:03.714 --> 00:20:07.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just decided
to let her see by my conduct

00:20:07.843 --> 00:20:10.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could never have meant
what she thought.

00:20:10.638 --> 00:20:15.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the week went by,
the days went by, the tension lessened.

00:20:15.017 --> 00:20:19.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by Monday when we left,
we were the best of friends.

00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:23.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she gave me a big hug,
and nothing more was said about the subject.

00:20:24.068 --> 00:20:26.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it sounds like you
handled that beautifully, Sister Herd.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your spiritual qualities were evident.

00:20:29.198 --> 00:20:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, finally, how has walking
in Jehovah’s way of peace

00:20:33.036 --> 00:20:35.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped you have peace with God?

00:20:35.413 --> 00:20:37.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you see Jehovah act

00:20:37.457 --> 00:20:40.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your behalf over and over and over again,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
it makes you feel that you have his approval.

00:20:43.463 --> 00:20:46.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that Sam and I are in our senior years,

00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:48.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel He has given us
‘the desire of our heart’

00:20:48.969 --> 00:20:51.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
by allowing us to serve at Bethel,

00:20:51.388 --> 00:20:53.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
which had been our goal for many years.

00:20:53.974 --> 00:20:57.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know that as long as
I stay faithful to Jehovah,

00:20:57.811 --> 00:21:01.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will continue to grant me inner peace.

00:21:01.231 --> 00:21:03.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have that confidence as well.

00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:05.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Sister Herd.

00:21:05.736 --> 00:21:10.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We deeply appreciate your comments
and your encouraging expressions.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s now address our final point.

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:20.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do to continue walking

00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:22.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:21:22.503 --> 00:21:25.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back
to our illustration of the road.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a literal road,
travelers may need to make adjustments

00:21:29.844 --> 00:21:32.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
in response to changing road conditions

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
or bad weather.

00:21:34.682 --> 00:21:39.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, as you go on walking
in the way of peace,

00:21:39.395 --> 00:21:44.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will need to readjust your actions
and thinking from time to time.

00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:48.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, a circuit overseer
shared an interesting point

00:21:48.446 --> 00:21:51.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding our thoughts
and attitudes on matters.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that they could either serve

00:21:53.952 --> 00:21:58.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a prison or a passport:

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
a prison, in that our thoughts and actions

00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:05.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
can confine or restrict us

00:22:05.923 --> 00:22:08.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a passport,

00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:12.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that they can take us where we need to be.

00:22:13.764 --> 00:22:16.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, right now, we need to be

00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:20.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay on this road to life.

00:22:20.354 --> 00:22:24.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to make sure
that any needed adjustments are made

00:22:24.942 --> 00:22:27.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our thoughts and our actions

00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:30.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’re not confined or restricted

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making spiritual progress.

00:22:34.744 --> 00:22:37.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what might be some areas

00:22:37.163 --> 00:22:39.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll need to make adjustments?

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:44.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, please, Paul’s words
in 2 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:22:47.298 --> 00:22:52.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll read 2 Corinthians 13:11.

00:22:58.852 --> 00:23:01.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Finally, brothers,

00:23:01.104 --> 00:23:05.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“continue to rejoice, to be readjusted,

00:23:05.192 --> 00:23:08.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be comforted, to think in agreement,

00:23:08.737 --> 00:23:10.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to live peaceably;

00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:15.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the God of love
and of peace will be with you.”

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:19.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice three areas in this verse

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Paul states we can make adjustments?

00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:27.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he says: “Continue to rejoice.”

00:23:28.758 --> 00:23:30.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can lose our peace and joy

00:23:30.801 --> 00:23:35.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become overwhelmed
by the anxieties of life.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in order to rejoice,

00:23:38.768 --> 00:23:41.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you make it a goal to focus on things

00:23:41.354 --> 00:23:45.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
that bring joy rather than sadness?

00:23:45.066 --> 00:23:50.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’re not feeling well
or coping with chronic pain,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can focus on God’s promise
of when no one will say:

00:23:54.242 --> 00:23:56.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am sick.”

00:23:57.412 --> 00:24:01.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re facing opposition for your beliefs,

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:05.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on the fact
that we’re part of a brotherhood

00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:08.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a brotherhood that supports
and prays for us—

00:24:08.632 --> 00:24:12.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and arrangements are in place
to keep us spiritually strong.

00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:16.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re discouraged by world events,

00:24:16.807 --> 00:24:18.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can rejoice in the fact

00:24:18.809 --> 00:24:22.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have a hope for the future,

00:24:22.855 --> 00:24:25.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know how this all ends.

00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:29.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that better times are ahead.

00:24:29.737 --> 00:24:33.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is, Don’t let negative thoughts

00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
restrict or limit your progress.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, make the needed adjustments

00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can move forward
and continue to rejoice.

00:24:46.421 --> 00:24:50.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note another area for readjustment
that Paul mentions in verse 11.

00:24:50.592 --> 00:24:52.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
There he says: “Continue . . .

00:24:52.594 --> 00:24:55.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think in agreement.”

00:24:56.765 --> 00:24:58.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were members of the congregation

00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:03.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in the first century
that were promoting apostate ideas.

00:25:03.772 --> 00:25:06.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others were introducing controversial ideas

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were not directly unscriptural,

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they were divisive.

00:25:12.281 --> 00:25:16.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
This resulted in bickering
and arguments over words,

00:25:16.702 --> 00:25:21.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
really creating
a spiritually unhealthy atmosphere.

00:25:21.165 --> 00:25:23.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s going to help us

00:25:23.167 --> 00:25:27.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to think in agreement?

00:25:27.129 --> 00:25:31.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Paul’s words at 2 Timothy 2:23

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “reject foolish and ignorant debates,

00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:39.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that they produce fights.”

00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:43.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we react strongly
when facing issues

00:25:43.104 --> 00:25:46.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
that clearly violate Jehovah’s moral laws.

00:25:46.274 --> 00:25:51.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if no Scriptural principle
is being violated,

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re wise to abstain
from promoting our personal opinions.

00:25:55.992 --> 00:25:59.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to do all we can to avoid starting

00:25:59.746 --> 00:26:02.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
or being drawn into disagreements

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:06.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can disrupt the peace
of the congregation.

00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:10.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, back in verse 11,

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:13.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
a third area where we can make adjustments

00:26:13.468 --> 00:26:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to continue “to live peaceably.”

00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:22.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
from the interview with our sisters

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:25.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they both did when challenged,

00:26:25.522 --> 00:26:30.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
when faced with a challenge
that threatened their peace?

00:26:30.277 --> 00:26:33.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took the matter to Jehovah in prayer.

00:26:33.322 --> 00:26:37.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reflected on scriptures
found in God’s Word.

00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:40.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they looked to see
how they could apply those verses

00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:43.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their particular situation.

00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:47.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped them to not only have inner peace

00:26:47.045 --> 00:26:50.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
but peace with others as well.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let your spiritual qualities
shine through.

00:26:55.386 --> 00:26:57.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to work on keeping peace,

00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:02.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing those qualities
of being loving and generous toward all,

00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:05.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially with our close family members,

00:27:05.981 --> 00:27:08.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether they are Witnesses or not.

00:27:10.777 --> 00:27:14.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to conclude
by reminding you baptism candidates

00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:17.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
that today marks a significant milestone

00:27:17.618 --> 00:27:22.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your journey
in your relationship with Jehovah.

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:25.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take the time to appreciate

00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:28.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
what this day means for you.

00:27:28.796 --> 00:27:31.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of all of you.

00:27:31.924 --> 00:27:36.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never regret
the decision you have made

00:27:36.095 --> 00:27:38.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:44.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
But keep in mind that after today and beyond,

00:27:44.478 --> 00:27:47.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
the journey is not yet over.

00:27:47.106 --> 00:27:49.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, it’s just the beginning.

00:27:49.317 --> 00:27:52.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we encourage you
to do all you can

00:27:52.945 --> 00:27:55.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay on the road to life.

00:27:55.615 --> 00:27:58.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind the points we considered today.

00:27:58.827 --> 00:28:03.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, do not give up
on walking in Jehovah’s way of peace.

00:28:03.832 --> 00:28:06.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your life depends on it.

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:09.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Allow Jehovah to guide your steps.

00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:15.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, stay within the boundaries
on the road to life.

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:18.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, you’re walking with a purpose,

00:28:18.305 --> 00:28:21.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will lead you to your destination

00:28:21.808 --> 00:28:26.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peaceful friendship with Jehovah forever.

00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:30.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, keep making
any needed adjustments

00:28:30.901 --> 00:28:34.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your thoughts, attitude, and actions

00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:39.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can maintain peace
with Jehovah and peace with others.

00:28:39.034 --> 00:28:41.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you continue to do these things,

00:28:41.704 --> 00:28:44.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only will you have peace

00:28:44.415 --> 00:28:48.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as the last part
of 2 Corinthians 13:11 says:

00:28:48.878 --> 00:28:52.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The God of love and of peace

00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:54.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be with you.”

00:28:54.425 --> 00:28:57.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you always remember that promise,

00:28:57.428 --> 00:29:01.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
which Jehovah makes to those

00:29:01.432 --> 00:29:03.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
who go on walking in the way of peace.

We are living

00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:09.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
in “critical times

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
hard to deal with.”

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people have lost all hope,

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and servants of Jehovah

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not free from trials.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:26.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may face loss of property,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of health,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of loved ones.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience deep emotional trauma

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:46.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even imprisonment for our faith.

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our trials are similar to those of Job,

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was so saddened that he once asked,

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why didn’t I die at birth?’

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we’ve had moments like that.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why should we not lose hope?

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because with every trial
comes Jehovah’s support

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
—support received in many forms:

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
material support,

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional support,

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual support.

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while Jehovah

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not remove all our trials now,

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust that with his support,

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can endure them

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:32.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they disappear
in “the real life” to come.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 34:17, 18 says:

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They cried out, and Jehovah heard . . .

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

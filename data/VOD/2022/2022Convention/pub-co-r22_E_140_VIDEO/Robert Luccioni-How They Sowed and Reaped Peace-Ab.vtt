00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pursuing peace can be a challenge.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our imperfections
and the complexities of life,

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to work for peace,
even under normal conditions.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
But pursuing peace
becomes a greater challenge

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it’s one-sided.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Difficulties arise in the family
and in the congregation

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
when one person pursues peace
but the other does not.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the congregation,
perhaps we have a friend

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has a problem with another friend
in the congregation

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
but does not do anything
to reconcile the situation,

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the family, a Christian mate

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have difficulty pursuing peace

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
if his or her spouse
does not apply Bible principles.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:48.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we do then?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in those situations,

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible account of Abigail may be helpful.

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to turn in your Bibles
to 1 Samuel chapter 25,

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here we’re introduced to Abigail
and her husband, Nabal.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you notice here in verse 3,
Nabal is described as “harsh.”

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 25,
Abigail describes him as ‘senseless.’

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 17, his own worker

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes him as “worthless”

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
and says “no one can speak [with] him.”

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:22.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with a personality like that,

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:26.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not surprising
that he mistreats David’s young men.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now David wants revenge.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you pursue peace
in a situation like that?

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does Abigail do?

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about it.

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:41.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
What she could have done.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Abigail could have done nothing.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not hard to imagine that she had

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:48.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
a difficult life as well
living with this man.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could have just stepped back
and let David come through

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do what he had in mind.

00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:57.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or she could have gone out to David
and inflamed the situation,

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe describing what a terrible man he is

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he mistreats her as well.

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, either of these approaches

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have made her life easier,
but she didn’t do that.

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Abigail could not change
her husband’s ways,

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:18.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she did what she could
to defuse an escalating conflict.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, notice her respectful,
well-chosen words.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to 1 Samuel 25,

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verses 27-31:

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now let this gift that your servant girl
has brought to my lord

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be given to the young men
who are following my lord.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pardon, please, the transgression
of your servant girl,

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:45.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah will without fail make
for my lord a lasting house,

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because my lord
is fighting the wars of Jehovah,

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and no evil has been found
in you all your days.

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:57.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When someone rises up to pursue you
and seeks your life,

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the life of my lord will be wrapped securely

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the bag of life with Jehovah your God,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the lives of your enemies

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he will hurl away like stones from a sling.

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And when Jehovah has done for my lord
all the good things he has promised

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he appoints you as leader over Israel,

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will have no remorse
or regret in your heart

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for shedding blood without cause

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and for letting the hand
of my lord take revenge.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:29.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jehovah confers good upon my lord,

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember your servant girl.”

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you notice what Abigail does?

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
She comes in with a gift,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
she bows down to David,

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:41.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
she takes the blame
for the situation herself,

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she reasons with him
using godly principles.

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abigail’s actions calm David

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avert a calamity.

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:54.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
She pursued peace.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to do that, she had to look
beyond her own feelings

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consider what was best
for Jehovah’s name.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:04.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is not always easy to do.

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was the result?

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:09.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because she sowed peace—she pursued peace—

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:12.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
she reaped peace.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:15.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we benefit from Abigail’s example?

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:18.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it important to do so now?

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at the following dramatization.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later on,

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:30.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
when things got even more intense,

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when our peace
was really put to the test.

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, Tim, you always
found a way to keep us positive.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:45.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I learned a lot about that
from my better half.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amy has always had a way
of bringing people together.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, just before the pandemic,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were these two pioneer sisters
in our congregation.

00:04:55.315 --> 00:05:00.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Becky was energetic, industrious,
and fearless in her ministry,

00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:04.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Lena was experienced, self-sacrificing,

00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such a good Bible teacher.

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they didn’t exactly get along.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:27.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready to go?

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:31.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just— It’s Becky.

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s just such a phantom pioneer.

00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:36.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never see her.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:39.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, but she just needs
to be more serious

00:05:39.318 --> 00:05:40.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
about her ministry.

00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:43.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she’s been doing
metro witnessing and . . .

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, I know, and LDC too, right?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does plumbing?

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:48.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concrete.

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:50.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does have a lot of energy!

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
when we used to be like that?

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:57.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know that I was ever like Becky.

00:05:57.294 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you weren’t.

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:00.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were Beckyer than Becky.

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t keep up with you

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those long service days
in your little red car.

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:07.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
That feels like a long time ago.

00:06:07.012 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:16.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Becky reminds me a lot of you

00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:18.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I mean both of us—

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:20.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
twenty years ago.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s working so hard,

00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:24.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s made
so many sacrifices

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:27.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the truth,
just like you have.

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:31.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we should get together

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:33.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the three of us.

00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:36.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should get to know her better.

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:43.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next week,
I had them both over to the house.

00:06:45.092 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the more those two
got to know each other,

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:51.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
the closer they became.

00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:57.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that proverb:
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”?

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:00.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amy taught me what that verse really means.

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:04.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, everyone out!

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:14.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
When everything changed

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:17.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we suddenly
found ourselves locked up together,

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:21.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to show that same spirit

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:23.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could stay united.

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:33.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with Jehovah’s help,

00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:36.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did.

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:46.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did you notice what our sister did
and did not do?

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:47.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could have done nothing.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could have let Lena, her service partner,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
cultivate those thoughts about Becky.

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Amy could have poured fuel
on the situation,

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe agreeing with Lena
or telling a few stories

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how Becky annoyed her as well.

00:08:02.336 --> 00:08:04.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she did not do that.

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:08.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Amy’s desire to sow peace
moved her to help Lena

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
see things from a different perspective.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result, the congregation benefited

00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:16.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reaped peace.

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul explains

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
this approach that we should take
if you turn in your Bibles

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Romans 12:18

00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:31.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 12:18:

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:34.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
be peaceable with all men.”

00:08:38.163 --> 00:08:41.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As far as it depends on you”

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:44.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
—see, our congregations
and our families benefit

00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:47.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we sow seeds of peace

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
before matters get out of hand.

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:52.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like seeing a small fire in our house.

00:08:52.844 --> 00:08:54.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we do?

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:57.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we just ignore it—hope it goes away?

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:00.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we fan the flames?
Do we put fuel on it?

00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:02.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we do something.
Why?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we know that if left unchecked,

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:08.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fire could destroy our home.

00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:11.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s similar when we see problems
that develop

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:13.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace being disrupted.

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:14.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do the same.
Why?

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we know that if we don’t
do something and if it’s left unchecked,

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:23.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
that disturbance could destroy our family

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:26.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the congregation.

00:09:26.044 --> 00:09:30.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question is,
How do we sow seeds of peace?

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Abigail was a good example.

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:33.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice what she did?

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:36.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
She considered how best
to approach the situation.

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:38.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was proactive.

00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:41.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
She didn’t just hope
it would go away on its own.

00:09:41.643 --> 00:09:45.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
She used respectful, soothing speech.

00:09:45.313 --> 00:09:49.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was careful not to fan the flames
or add fuel to it

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:52.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all good steps we can take.

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:55.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have other resources
to help us as well.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do research in the Bible
and in our publications

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how others have sowed peace
in similar situations,

00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:06.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can also consult with the elders.

00:10:06.626 --> 00:10:10.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we understand that this
is especially a challenge

00:10:10.964 --> 00:10:15.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the situation is in the family,
as it was for Abigail.

00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:18.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not easy at all.

00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in those situations,

00:10:20.348 --> 00:10:23.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to focus on your mate’s good qualities,

00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:27.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on his or her irritating traits.

00:10:27.814 --> 00:10:31.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with all of this,
we have to be realistic.

00:10:31.109 --> 00:10:34.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what the apostle Paul said there
as recorded in verse 18.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said “if possible,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as it depends on you.”

00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:43.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul is acknowledging
that peace with others

00:10:43.997 --> 00:10:46.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not always be possible.

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do?

00:10:48.168 --> 00:10:50.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to do the best that we can,

00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:53.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we leave the rest
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:56.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we be determined

00:10:56.301 --> 00:11:00.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
to develop the practice
of pursuing peace now.

00:11:00.972 --> 00:11:04.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re in the congregation
or in the family,

00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:07.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be confident that if we sow peace,

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will reap peace,
even if others don’t respond.

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:15.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll have peace with Jehovah,
peace with ourselves,

00:11:15.904 --> 00:11:19.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the knowledge
that we did the right thing.

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, when in the future

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:25.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
a force for peace is vitally needed,

00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:28.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be prepared to provide it.

00:11:30.168 --> 00:11:33.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother William Malenfant,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:36.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:40.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Mephibosheth.”

WEBVTT

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
We extend a warm welcome to one and all.

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this session, which corresponds

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:31.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Saturday afternoon portion
of the program,

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will learn what we individually can do

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue peace with others.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:42.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will begin
with a music-video presentation.

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
The video will encourage us
to welcome others

00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
into our peaceful worldwide brotherhood.

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:50.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy.

00:10:12.638 --> 00:10:16.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please join in singing
song number 29, entitled

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Living Up to Our Name”—song number 29.

00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, our imperfections
can disrupt our peace

00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:58.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that of others.

00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:00.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the next symposium,

00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:03.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will consider things we must avoid

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:07.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to cultivate peaceful relationships.

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:11.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please give your attention
to Brother Harold Corkern,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:13:13.904 --> 00:13:16.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he develops the theme

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers
—Inappropriate Boasting.”

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:33.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
What comes to your mind
when you hear the expression “put away”?

00:13:33.924 --> 00:13:36.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may think of related expressions

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:40.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as “cast aside,” “dispose of,”

00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:43.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“discard,” “get rid of.”

00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:48.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did we have to put away
to become a Christian?

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible in the book

00:13:50.482 --> 00:13:55.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Ephesians 4:22
provides the answer.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:57.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Ephesians 4:22:

00:13:59.074 --> 00:14:03.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You were taught
to put away the old personality

00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:06.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that conforms
to your former course of conduct

00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:11.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is being corrupted
according to its deceptive desires.”

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we had “to put away the old personality.”

00:14:15.966 --> 00:14:18.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s one thing to put it away;

00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:21.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s something else to keep it away.

00:14:21.263 --> 00:14:24.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why
in the very next verse, verse 23,

00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:27.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul encourages us to do this:

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:14:30.564 --> 00:14:33.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:14:33.526 --> 00:14:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so important to keep it away,

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the old personality has traits

00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:41.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can become peace wreckers.

00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:47.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium
will consider five peace wreckers

00:14:47.165 --> 00:14:51.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should put away and keep away.

00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:54.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each talk will include
the following main points:

00:14:54.005 --> 00:14:58.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) It will define the peace wrecker,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) it will explain how it wrecks peace,

00:15:02.513 --> 00:15:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) we will consider how to put it away.

00:15:07.977 --> 00:15:11.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the very first one
that we’re going to talk about?

00:15:11.898 --> 00:15:16.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is inappropriate boasting.

00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:18.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is inappropriate boasting?

00:15:18.863 --> 00:15:21.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, it’s self-praise,

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:24.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible condemns self-praise

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice Proverbs 27:2:

00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:30.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let someone else praise you,

00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:32.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and not your own mouth;

00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:35.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
others, and not your own lips.”

00:15:37.298 --> 00:15:40.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Self-praise is an evidence of pride

00:15:40.802 --> 00:15:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
that causes one
to elevate himself above others.

00:15:45.348 --> 00:15:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some might develop an unhealthy pride

00:15:48.184 --> 00:15:52.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
about their accomplishments,
even in the ministry.

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:54.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happened in the first century.

00:15:54.774 --> 00:15:57.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul had to write
to the Corinthian congregation

00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:59.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the dissensions that they were having,

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:01.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lack of peace they were experiencing.

00:16:01.865 --> 00:16:03.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:07.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, some in the congregation
were “puffed up with pride” about themselves

00:16:07.329 --> 00:16:09.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other men,

00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:12.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Paul, Apollos, Cephas.

00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:16.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were giving
too much attention to themselves

00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:18.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to other men.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how could that happen today?

00:16:22.552 --> 00:16:24.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s imagine
a group of brothers talking,

00:16:24.763 --> 00:16:27.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one in the group says,

00:16:27.057 --> 00:16:30.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With Jehovah’s help
and with diligent prayer and effort,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
I finally got a Bible study.”

00:16:33.814 --> 00:16:37.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
But right away,
another one in the group proudly declares,

00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:40.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have four Bible studies;

00:16:40.112 --> 00:16:45.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
two are attending meetings,
and one will soon be baptized.”

00:16:45.117 --> 00:16:47.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could such a statement be a peace wrecker?

00:16:49.454 --> 00:16:54.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does inappropriate boasting
wreck peace?

00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:57.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s not wrong
to take pleasure in our work

00:16:57.588 --> 00:17:01.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to thank Jehovah
for the success that we may have.

00:17:01.592 --> 00:17:04.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
But inappropriate boasting
about our accomplishments

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
can stir up competition, envy, and rivalry.

00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:12.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must remember that self-promotion

00:17:12.603 --> 00:17:15.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not originate
with our heavenly Father, “the God of peace.”

00:17:15.773 --> 00:17:18.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where does it originate?

00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:20.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 2:16 says:

00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:23.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The showy display of one’s means of life

00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:25.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not originate with the Father,

00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
but originates with the world.”

00:17:28.494 --> 00:17:33.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
And would you not agree
that the world is filled with self-praise?

00:17:33.499 --> 00:17:36.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even on their social media, we see this.

00:17:36.752 --> 00:17:39.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the material
that people post on social media

00:17:39.797 --> 00:17:43.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to make one
appear very important.

00:17:43.801 --> 00:17:45.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is a showy display

00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:48.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
of their accomplishments,
their material possessions,

00:17:48.639 --> 00:17:52.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
or their expensive vacations that they enjoy.

00:17:52.977 --> 00:17:57.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, it’s all about “look at me.”

00:17:57.606 --> 00:18:00.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to avoid getting caught up

00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:02.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the world’s spirit of self-promotion

00:18:02.945 --> 00:18:05.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wrecks peace.

00:18:06.574 --> 00:18:09.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate just how devastating

00:18:09.035 --> 00:18:12.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace wrecker’s
inappropriate boasting can be,

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s briefly consider
the Bible character Haman.

00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:19.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a proud and haughty man,

00:18:19.295 --> 00:18:21.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he boasted a lot.

00:18:21.339 --> 00:18:23.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esther chapter 5 tells us

00:18:23.382 --> 00:18:25.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was boasting
with his family and friends

00:18:25.718 --> 00:18:28.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his wealth, his many sons,

00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:31.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the king had promoted him
to a high station,

00:18:31.432 --> 00:18:33.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was above all the other servants,

00:18:33.643 --> 00:18:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he’d had a special meal, or banquet,

00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:38.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the king and queen.

00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:42.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Haman was hateful and arrogant.

00:18:42.694 --> 00:18:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was plotting to kill
Jehovah’s faithful servant Mordecai.

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:51.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
But his scheme
and his attitudes were exposed.

00:18:51.077 --> 00:18:52.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happened?

00:18:52.954 --> 00:18:55.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
The very stake that Haman had built

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:59.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hang Mordecai on he was hung on.

00:18:59.169 --> 00:19:01.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it reminds us
—doesn’t it?—

00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:05.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at Isaiah 29:20, the Bible says:

00:19:05.383 --> 00:19:09.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The boaster will come to his finish.”

00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:11.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
So because of the devastating effects

00:19:11.806 --> 00:19:15.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
that improper boasting
can have on ourselves and others,

00:19:15.143 --> 00:19:19.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not even want
to give the impression of boasting.

00:19:20.607 --> 00:19:22.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:19:22.942 --> 00:19:25.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a sister’s actions

00:19:25.278 --> 00:19:28.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
are misunderstood as boasting.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put away from yourselves every kind

00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:38.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath,

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:41.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“screaming, and abusive speech,

00:19:41.586 --> 00:19:44.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as everything injurious.”

00:19:44.965 --> 00:19:47.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did anyone start the day thinking,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I believe I’ll show malicious bitterness
to my brother today’?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not! 

00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:56.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet the potential is there, isn’t it?

00:19:57.769 --> 00:20:01.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
But genuine affection fights peace wreckers.

00:20:01.898 --> 00:20:06.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And affection grows when we really know
our brothers and sisters well.

00:20:06.903 --> 00:20:11.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember their joys

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:13.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pains,

00:20:14.578 --> 00:20:17.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
their selfless zeal,

00:20:17.414 --> 00:20:20.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they came to love Jehovah,

00:20:22.044 --> 00:20:24.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they endure.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll get back as soon as I can.

00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:32.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love you. Bye.

00:20:32.429 --> 00:20:33.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:20:37.184 --> 00:20:38.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, love?

00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:40.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
So sorry, I’ve got to run.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. I’ll ring you about this week.

00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:42.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks. Love you both.

00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:43.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you!

00:20:43.941 --> 00:20:45.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
The afternoon would look better.

00:20:47.277 --> 00:20:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nana!

00:20:48.237 --> 00:20:50.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, Haley, darling.

00:20:50.155 --> 00:20:52.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so, so sorry.

00:20:53.117 --> 00:20:55.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it’s not too bad.

00:20:56.912 --> 00:20:58.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got this.

00:20:58.664 --> 00:20:59.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:20:59.665 --> 00:21:00.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are you though?

00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:02.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you. I’m so sorry.

00:21:02.376 --> 00:21:03.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, poor thing.

00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:04.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me clear this up.

00:21:14.847 --> 00:21:15.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:19.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, Nana, it’s Sunday today, isn’t it?

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one.

00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:22.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s felt like such a long day, hasn’t it?

00:21:22.855 --> 00:21:23.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has felt like a long day.

00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:31.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:33.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sleep well.

00:22:10.653 --> 00:22:11.779 line:90% position:50% align:center

this gorgeous earring and necklace set.

00:22:27.337 --> 00:22:31.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you can see, the first disc I’ve done
is in this warm nude tone,

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s great because it goes . . .

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe her?

00:22:35.678 --> 00:22:37.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley’s business feed?

00:22:38.431 --> 00:22:40.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what makes this set is really special.

00:22:40.433 --> 00:22:43.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s giving you
that understated elegant look.

00:22:49.484 --> 00:22:52.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you look this good, you feel great.

00:22:59.286 --> 00:23:03.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was the sister in this video
boasting inappropriately?

00:23:03.748 --> 00:23:07.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she was a humble servant of Jehovah,

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:11.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
kindly and patiently
helping her elderly relative.

00:23:11.673 --> 00:23:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you recall her business website

00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:18.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the presentation she made
about her jewelry products?

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said,

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When you look this good,
you feel great.”

00:23:25.312 --> 00:23:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her Christian sister was upset

00:23:28.148 --> 00:23:31.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took those comments and her actions

00:23:31.485 --> 00:23:33.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be boastful.

00:23:33.695 --> 00:23:35.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this video reminds us

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about how our words and our actions

00:23:38.825 --> 00:23:41.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
may appear to others.

00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:43.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we’re going to get to the question:

00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:48.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we put away inappropriate boasting?

00:23:48.335 --> 00:23:51.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
A key point that we must always remember

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to do just that
is recorded in the book

00:23:54.508 --> 00:23:58.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 1 Corinthians 4:7,

00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:02.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Corinthians 4:7:

00:24:02.516 --> 00:24:05.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For who makes you different from another?

00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:09.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, what do you have
that you did not receive?

00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:11.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, in fact, you did receive it,

00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:15.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do you boast
as though you did not receive it?”

00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:18.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point of this scripture?

00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:21.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not want to boast about ourselves

00:24:21.118 --> 00:24:26.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
but give all credit to Jehovah
for the good that we can do.

00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:30.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some people are proud
about their good looks,

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:33.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
their popularity,
their wealth, their position,

00:24:33.464 --> 00:24:38.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
their physical strength,
their musical ability.

00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:41.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, King David of ancient Israel

00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:43.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
had all of those assets.

00:24:43.224 --> 00:24:45.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
But throughout his entire life,

00:24:45.434 --> 00:24:47.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
he never became a boastful person.

00:24:47.812 --> 00:24:49.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
He remained humble.

00:24:49.814 --> 00:24:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:24:51.607 --> 00:24:54.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 113:5-8,

00:24:54.568 --> 00:24:58.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
David gave all credit to Jehovah.

00:24:58.114 --> 00:25:01.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that in his case
Jehovah stooped down

00:25:01.617 --> 00:25:04.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took this “lowly” one
and raised him up

00:25:04.996 --> 00:25:07.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “sit with nobles.”

00:25:07.665 --> 00:25:10.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on every occasion that he had,

00:25:10.167 --> 00:25:13.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
David would always say, ‘Praise Jehovah,

00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:15.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
boast about his holy name.’

00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:21.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we, like David,
should “boast in Jehovah.”

00:25:21.095 --> 00:25:25.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul encouraged us to do that
at 1 Corinthians 1:31:

00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:29.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who boasts,
let him boast in Jehovah.”

00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:31.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:25:31.856 --> 00:25:36.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that we boast in the privilege
of knowing the true God

00:25:36.194 --> 00:25:40.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of being able
to be used by him to accomplish his will.

00:25:43.076 --> 00:25:46.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another way
that we can put away improper boasting

00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:49.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to not talk about ourselves,

00:25:49.749 --> 00:25:53.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to acknowledge the good
and the fine qualities

00:25:53.169 --> 00:25:55.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our fellow workers have.

00:25:56.339 --> 00:26:00.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble and modest people
don’t brag about what they do,

00:26:00.051 --> 00:26:02.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they turn their attention
to their fellow workers

00:26:02.637 --> 00:26:04.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Jehovah is using them

00:26:04.806 --> 00:26:07.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blessing them in his service.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do that,

00:26:09.352 --> 00:26:12.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
that creates a very peaceful,
happy environment.

00:26:14.482 --> 00:26:18.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, may we continue
to put away and keep away

00:26:18.027 --> 00:26:20.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
inappropriate boasting—self-praise.

00:26:20.905 --> 00:26:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:26:22.407 --> 00:26:27.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
By giving praise and thanks and honor
to Jehovah for our accomplishments

00:26:27.078 --> 00:26:30.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by commending our fellow workers
for all the good qualities they have

00:26:30.915 --> 00:26:34.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for how Jehovah
is using them in his service.

00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, we will preserve
our precious possession of peace

00:26:38.882 --> 00:26:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah and with our brothers.

00:26:44.888 --> 00:26:48.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Seth Hyatt,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:26:48.266 --> 00:26:51.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers—Envy.”

00:27:02.656 --> 00:27:04.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is envy?

00:27:04.658 --> 00:27:06.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know?

00:27:06.326 --> 00:27:10.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s important that we be able to identify
the symptoms of envy.

00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:12.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:16.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because envy is an expression
of hatred.

00:27:16.962 --> 00:27:19.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an enemy of peace.

00:27:19.464 --> 00:27:21.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if left unchecked,

00:27:21.758 --> 00:27:25.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can result in spiritual death.

00:27:25.721 --> 00:27:30.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
As described in the Bible,
envy has two symptoms.

00:27:30.726 --> 00:27:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is probably more familiar.

00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:36.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
An envious person wants

00:27:36.064 --> 00:27:39.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
what someone else has.

00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:41.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the second symptom

00:27:41.153 --> 00:27:45.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that makes envy especially dangerous.

00:27:45.157 --> 00:27:50.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
An envious person not only wants
what someone else has,

00:27:50.162 --> 00:27:54.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also doesn’t want
the other person to have it.

00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:56.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an example:

00:27:56.502 --> 00:28:01.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first century,
Jewish religious leaders envied Jesus

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus was much appreciated
by the common people.

00:28:06.345 --> 00:28:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus dealt with people,

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
including lowly ones,
in a way that dignified them.

00:28:12.351 --> 00:28:16.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, he was appreciated.

00:28:16.355 --> 00:28:19.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
The religious leaders envied him.

00:28:19.108 --> 00:28:24.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather than adjusting their own way
of dealing with people,

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
they attacked Jesus verbally

00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:31.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an effort to destroy
his good reputation.

00:28:31.162 --> 00:28:34.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spread malicious slander.

00:28:34.707 --> 00:28:38.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only did they want
what Jesus had,

00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:41.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also they didn’t want
Jesus to have it.

00:28:41.547 --> 00:28:45.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder envy is listed
as one of “the works of the flesh”

00:28:45.843 --> 00:28:50.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 5:21.

00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:52.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a dangerous quality

00:28:52.725 --> 00:28:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to avoid.

00:28:56.938 --> 00:29:01.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does envy disrupt peace?

00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:06.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Envy undermines, damages,

00:29:06.823 --> 00:29:10.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even destroys relationships

00:29:10.535 --> 00:29:14.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the family and in the congregation.

00:29:14.747 --> 00:29:18.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the example of Jacob

00:29:18.584 --> 00:29:21.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his 12 sons.

00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:26.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob had special affection
for one of his sons, Joseph.

00:29:27.594 --> 00:29:30.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
Joseph’s brothers became envious.

00:29:30.763 --> 00:29:33.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did the envy manifest itself?

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the fruitage?

00:29:36.436 --> 00:29:40.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they dealt treacherously
with Joseph, selling him into slavery.

00:29:40.482 --> 00:29:45.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as if that weren’t bad enough,
they compounded their wrong

00:29:45.111 --> 00:29:47.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
by lying to Jacob,

00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:51.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling him that Joseph was dead.

00:29:51.159 --> 00:29:53.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Bible account,

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob “refused to be comforted.”

00:29:57.707 --> 00:30:01.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
He mourned Joseph for years.

00:30:01.169 --> 00:30:05.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a terrible consequence of envy!

00:30:05.006 --> 00:30:07.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s clear that envy

00:30:07.592 --> 00:30:10.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows no room for love,

00:30:10.262 --> 00:30:12.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
compassion, or kindness.

00:30:12.722 --> 00:30:15.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those qualities go out the window.

00:30:15.976 --> 00:30:19.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re replaced by qualities

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as hatred, strife, fits of anger.

00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:29.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can envy disrupt the peace
of a congregation?

00:30:29.489 --> 00:30:33.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the examples
of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

00:30:33.702 --> 00:30:37.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
They envied Moses and Aaron

00:30:37.456 --> 00:30:39.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation of Israel.

00:30:41.418 --> 00:30:45.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did that envy manifest itself?

00:30:45.088 --> 00:30:48.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they began
to speak negatively—critically—

00:30:48.258 --> 00:30:51.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s representatives,
even accusing Moses

00:30:51.678 --> 00:30:56.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
of playing the prince
and lifting himself up above the others.

00:30:57.601 --> 00:31:00.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
They forgot that Jehovah

00:31:00.395 --> 00:31:05.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
had put Moses and Aaron
in their positions of responsibility.

00:31:06.276 --> 00:31:09.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah react

00:31:09.196 --> 00:31:12.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that manifestation of envy?

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:16.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
He destroyed those three men
and all who supported them.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a time, the congregation
was robbed of its peace,

00:31:20.708 --> 00:31:23.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the accounts
certainly provide some insight

00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:27.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
into Jehovah’s view of envy.

00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:30.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, by this point,
you’re no doubt thinking,

00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:34.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I would never want something
so badly that I would

00:31:34.221 --> 00:31:37.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
damage someone else to get it.’

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re all imperfect.

00:31:39.852 --> 00:31:42.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a treacherous heart,

00:31:42.354 --> 00:31:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and envy is insidious.

00:31:45.441 --> 00:31:47.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:31:47.777 --> 00:31:52.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how envy
threatens to disrupt peace.

00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:32:14.428 --> 00:32:16.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad news?

00:32:19.183 --> 00:32:21.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a sweetie.

00:32:21.227 --> 00:32:23.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds me that I want to speak to her
about a necklace.

00:32:23.521 --> 00:32:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too?

00:32:24.939 --> 00:32:26.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone thinks she’s “Miss Wonderful”;

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s starting to agree.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:32:39.746 --> 00:32:41.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems it’s all about Haley.

00:32:44.167 --> 00:32:46.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your tea is getting cold.

00:32:48.546 --> 00:32:50.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re changing the subject.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:55.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’ve brought this up before.

00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:58.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:33:00.516 --> 00:33:03.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re friends; you pioneer together.

00:33:03.311 --> 00:33:05.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, and that’s why I’m concerned.

00:33:07.398 --> 00:33:09.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concern is good,

00:33:09.901 --> 00:33:12.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:33:12.237 --> 00:33:15.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:33:26.501 --> 00:33:29.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you notice?

00:33:29.462 --> 00:33:34.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Emily is suffering
from an onset of envy.

00:33:34.926 --> 00:33:38.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
how she questioned Haley’s motives

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:45.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and potentially called
Haley’s reputation into question?

00:33:47.772 --> 00:33:50.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could happen to any one of us.

00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:55.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we battle and conquer envy?

00:33:55.864 --> 00:34:00.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
By cultivating two beautiful qualities,

00:34:00.285 --> 00:34:04.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility and contentment.

00:34:04.331 --> 00:34:08.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what the Bible
has to say about humility.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Philippians chapter 2,

00:34:11.588 --> 00:34:15.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to begin reading
in verse 3

00:34:17.552 --> 00:34:20.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Philippians 2:3:

00:34:22.432 --> 00:34:25.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness

00:34:25.853 --> 00:34:28.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
or out of egotism.”

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is egotism?

00:34:30.482 --> 00:34:35.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s having
an exaggerated opinion of oneself.

00:34:35.487 --> 00:34:40.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that the religious leaders
in Jesus’ day,

00:34:40.242 --> 00:34:42.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph’s brothers,

00:34:42.786 --> 00:34:46.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram

00:34:46.498 --> 00:34:48.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
had this affliction?

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they have an exaggerated view
of themselves?

00:34:51.837 --> 00:34:54.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without question!

00:34:54.048 --> 00:34:57.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s an affliction
that could affect any one of us.

00:34:57.843 --> 00:34:59.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the solution?

00:34:59.845 --> 00:35:01.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Paul continues:

00:35:01.847 --> 00:35:05.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But with humility [or, lowliness of mind]

00:35:05.351 --> 00:35:08.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider others superior to you”

00:35:08.229 --> 00:35:10.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
—or consider others

00:35:10.439 --> 00:35:14.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
as more important than yourself.

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:17.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that kind of mindset

00:35:17.404 --> 00:35:21.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows a person to do what’s stated
in verse 4:

00:35:21.534 --> 00:35:23.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As you look out not only

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:25.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for your own interests,

00:35:25.788 --> 00:35:29.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person

00:35:33.129 --> 00:35:35.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks out for others.

00:35:35.548 --> 00:35:37.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t feel that he deserves

00:35:37.967 --> 00:35:41.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than others.

00:35:41.345 --> 00:35:45.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Contentment—a content person
is satisfied with what he has.

00:35:45.808 --> 00:35:50.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t compare
his privilege or his possession

00:35:50.813 --> 00:35:55.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
with another person’s privilege
or possession.

00:35:55.151 --> 00:35:57.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s content.

00:35:57.612 --> 00:36:01.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility, contentment

00:36:01.073 --> 00:36:06.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
—with Jehovah’s help we can cultivate
these beautiful qualities—

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:11.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
qualities that leave no room for envy.

00:36:11.084 --> 00:36:14.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in doing so, we promote peace

00:36:14.379 --> 00:36:17.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
—inner peace, peace in our family,

00:36:17.215 --> 00:36:20.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace in the congregation.

00:36:20.426 --> 00:36:25.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can be sure
that Jehovah appreciates that.

00:36:26.391 --> 00:36:30.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:36:33.815 --> 00:36:38.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers—Dishonesty.”

00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:50.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
What comes to your mind
when you hear the word “dishonesty”?

00:36:50.331 --> 00:36:54.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you think of Satan,
“the father of the lie.”

00:36:54.127 --> 00:36:57.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Ananias and his wife come to your mind.

00:36:57.005 --> 00:37:01.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lost their lives because of lying.

00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:03.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not want to imitate such ones.

00:37:03.803 --> 00:37:06.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
We avoid lying.

00:37:06.765 --> 00:37:11.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that, though, as far as our honesty goes?

00:37:12.854 --> 00:37:16.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our holy God, Jehovah,
wants us to be holy as well,

00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:20.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is why he urged
the ancient Israelites

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:22.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to deceive others

00:37:22.447 --> 00:37:26.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
as mentioned at Leviticus 19:11.

00:37:27.327 --> 00:37:31.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this not add some color to honesty?

00:37:32.582 --> 00:37:37.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty includes
(and please take note of this definition)

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:42.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
intentionally leading someone
to a wrong conclusion.

00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:45.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, by twisting the truth

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:48.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
or by providing only certain details,

00:37:48.682 --> 00:37:51.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endanger our peace with others.

00:37:51.351 --> 00:37:53.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say so?

00:37:53.395 --> 00:37:57.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does dishonesty wreck peace?

00:37:58.775 --> 00:38:01.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace and a peaceful relationship

00:38:01.778 --> 00:38:04.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
are built on trust.

00:38:04.406 --> 00:38:09.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting someone makes you feel
safe and secure

00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:11.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and puts you at ease.

00:38:11.663 --> 00:38:15.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no peace without trust.

00:38:15.501 --> 00:38:18.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we develop trust?

00:38:18.962 --> 00:38:22.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust is the result
of spending time together,

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:25.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking the truth with one another.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust people who act unselfishly

00:38:28.138 --> 00:38:31.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not use “crooked speech,”
as the Bible puts it.

00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:37.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
If someone deceives us only once
or is dishonest in another way,

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:41.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might start to question
everything they say.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
One single act of dishonesty may be enough.

00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:47.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can ruin their reputation.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
As bad as this is,
dishonesty has the potential

00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:56.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
to create even greater damage.

00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:58.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty can be compared

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:02.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a highly contagious virus.

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:07.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty breeds dishonesty.

00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:11.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
People who have contact
with deceitful, dishonest persons

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:14.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in danger of being infected.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:19.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty might not only wreck
one relationship

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:21.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
but multiple relationships,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting the unity and peace
of the whole group at risk.

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:30.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds us of the relationship

00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:34.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Laban and Jacob
in the Bible book of Genesis.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:37.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on the agreement with Laban,

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob worked hard for seven years

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:43.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to marry Laban’s daughter Rachel.

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:48.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
And despite this high price
that Jacob had to pay,

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:51.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
those years seemed for him

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:54.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like “a few days.”

00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, instead of Rachel,

00:39:58.187 --> 00:40:01.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
he received the older daughter, Leah,
as a wife.

00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:05.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now Leah was also part of the deception.

00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:10.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result after Jacob had found out

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Laban tricked him?

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
The trust was gone.

00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:18.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
The relationship had suffered
to a great degree.

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:22.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty wrecked the peace
in those relationships,

00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:27.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so the following seven years
of work for Rachel were bitter.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:32.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Laban’s dishonesty emboldened him
to continue in his course.

00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He unfairly changed Jacob’s wages ten times.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:40.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
He deceived Jacob.

00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Laban’s dishonesty,

00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:46.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace in the whole family
was disrupted.

00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:53.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us now continue to watch
the next segment of the dramatization.

00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:57.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
We left Emily and Celia sitting
in a coffee shop.

00:40:57.372 --> 00:40:59.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch carefully, and notice

00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:03.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Emily is tempted to alter the truth.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
You pioneer together.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, and that’s why I’m concerned.

00:41:09.509 --> 00:41:11.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concern is good,

00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:12.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:41:12.596 --> 00:41:16.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:21.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought you would understand.

00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:24.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I understand your feelings.

00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not about Haley?

00:41:27.277 --> 00:41:30.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t seen all her posts.

00:41:30.739 --> 00:41:32.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing immoral, is there?

00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:35.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:38.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good. That’s not like her.

00:41:39.373 --> 00:41:41.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if

00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:44.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a case of her being more careful
how she comes across,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s another matter.

00:41:46.964 --> 00:41:48.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you talk to her?

00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:41:55.931 --> 00:42:00.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily, you are a beautiful, spiritual sister.

00:42:03.606 --> 00:42:05.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:42:06.775 --> 00:42:08.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
for years,

00:42:10.613 --> 00:42:14.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a bad habit
of comparing myself to others.

00:42:15.993 --> 00:42:20.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
My own insecurity hurt me

00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:22.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my closest friends.

00:42:33.969 --> 00:42:36.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you don’t think
I should’ve spoken to Celia?

00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:40.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I’m glad you asked Celia about it

00:42:40.393 --> 00:42:42.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone you trust.

00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:44.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she say?

00:42:44.939 --> 00:42:47.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she definitely understands how I feel.

00:42:48.442 --> 00:42:49.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:42:51.487 --> 00:42:53.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
And about Haley’s posts?

00:42:54.657 --> 00:42:58.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she hasn’t seen
everything she has out there.

00:42:58.536 --> 00:42:59.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:43:01.456 --> 00:43:04.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did say that Haley

00:43:04.792 --> 00:43:07.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs to be more careful

00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:09.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
how she comes across.

00:43:12.967 --> 00:43:14.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she suggest?

00:43:16.095 --> 00:43:19.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I should tell her
that she needs to stop,

00:43:19.182 --> 00:43:21.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m too worked up.

00:43:25.313 --> 00:43:26.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look,

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Celia agrees
that Haley is doing something she shouldn’t,

00:43:34.614 --> 00:43:36.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should talk to her.

00:43:40.703 --> 00:43:42.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll find the right time.

00:43:51.256 --> 00:43:53.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for understanding.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m hungry.

00:43:55.802 --> 00:43:57.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you say the prayer?

00:43:57.262 --> 00:43:58.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:44:00.682 --> 00:44:03.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, we’d like to praise you

00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:05.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your generosity and kindness . . .

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how Emily just heard
what she wanted to hear?

00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:21.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
In talking to her husband, Jake,
she painted an incomplete picture.

00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:24.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did not relay that Celia had no opinion

00:44:24.122 --> 00:44:27.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the social media posts of Haley.

00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:30.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And contrary to what she told her husband,

00:44:30.337 --> 00:44:34.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Celia did not encourage her
to tell Haley to stop.

00:44:35.008 --> 00:44:38.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters deserve the truth.

00:44:38.136 --> 00:44:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Emily didn’t relay that, did she?

00:44:41.515 --> 00:44:44.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was dishonest, something that can have

00:44:44.643 --> 00:44:47.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
a damaging effect, as we will see later.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to put away

00:44:51.942 --> 00:44:54.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
this peace wrecker, dishonesty.

00:44:54.111 --> 00:44:57.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us to always be truthful,

00:44:57.155 --> 00:44:59.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in small matters.

00:44:59.616 --> 00:45:04.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, how do we put away dishonesty?

00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:09.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us please turn to Ephesians chapter 4.

00:45:09.501 --> 00:45:12.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here the apostle Paul reminds us

00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:14.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a reason to be honest.

00:45:14.673 --> 00:45:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Ephesians chapter 4,

00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:20.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to read verse 25:

00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:26.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, now that you
have put away deceit,

00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:29.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each one of you speak truth
with his neighbor,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we are members
belonging to one another.”

00:45:35.152 --> 00:45:38.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice why we put away deceit

00:45:38.614 --> 00:45:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speak truth with one another?

00:45:41.742 --> 00:45:46.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Because we are
members belonging to one another.”

00:45:46.163 --> 00:45:49.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, Paul reminds us of the fact

00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:51.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
that dishonesty affects others

00:45:51.919 --> 00:45:55.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our brothers and our relationship with them.

00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:57.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, knowing this,

00:45:57.633 --> 00:46:01.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we put away dishonesty?

00:46:01.345 --> 00:46:03.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is:

00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:08.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
By considering the consequences
of dishonesty and honesty.

00:46:08.436 --> 00:46:12.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help us to do the right thing.

00:46:12.398 --> 00:46:17.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what are the consequences of dishonesty?

00:46:17.028 --> 00:46:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve seen in the case of Laban and Jacob,

00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:24.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will disrupt the peace with others.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since Jehovah hates dishonesty,

00:46:27.038 --> 00:46:31.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will also disrupt our peace with Jehovah.

00:46:32.794 --> 00:46:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:46:34.837 --> 00:46:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
what are the consequences of honesty?

00:46:39.008 --> 00:46:43.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
While dishonesty might seem in the moment
to be the easier way out,

00:46:43.304 --> 00:46:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the long run,

00:46:45.348 --> 00:46:49.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
honesty will enable us to have good friends.

00:46:49.227 --> 00:46:51.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to enjoy peace as well,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore they are also searching

00:46:54.148 --> 00:46:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone they can trust.

00:46:57.026 --> 00:46:59.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this way, we are

00:46:59.028 --> 00:47:03.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
like ‘body members belonging to one another.’

00:47:04.701 --> 00:47:06.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even more important,

00:47:06.953 --> 00:47:10.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy a good conscience

00:47:10.582 --> 00:47:13.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “peace with God.”

00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:17.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, therefore, put away
this peace wrecker (dishonesty)

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
by sticking to the truth
even in small things.

00:47:21.509 --> 00:47:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah knows

00:47:24.387 --> 00:47:26.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
that for us imperfect humans

00:47:26.598 --> 00:47:29.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is not always easy.

00:47:29.059 --> 00:47:31.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he promises to help us

00:47:31.811 --> 00:47:34.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to bless every step we take

00:47:34.856 --> 00:47:38.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build trust and peace

00:47:38.151 --> 00:47:40.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not to wreck it.

00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:46.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Patrick LaFranca,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:47:46.159 --> 00:47:49.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:53.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers—Harmful Gossip.”

00:48:01.425 --> 00:48:02.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you gossip?

00:48:02.717 --> 00:48:03.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:48:03.885 --> 00:48:07.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, whenever we share
any news about others,

00:48:07.139 --> 00:48:09.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is a form of gossip.

00:48:09.266 --> 00:48:12.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we are interested in others,
we might say,

00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:15.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am really concerned
about Brother Smith’s health,”

00:48:15.772 --> 00:48:20.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Did you hear about Sister Brown’s
experience in the ministry?”

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this type of gossip harmful?

00:48:22.529 --> 00:48:24.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Generally not.

00:48:24.531 --> 00:48:26.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, we need to be careful.

00:48:26.742 --> 00:48:28.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Timothy 5:13,

00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:31.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul spoke out against certain sisters

00:48:31.622 --> 00:48:36.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were “gossipers
and meddlers in other people’s affairs.”

00:48:36.585 --> 00:48:39.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not need to know
and share everything we know

00:48:39.922 --> 00:48:43.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what’s happening
in other people’s lives.

00:48:43.592 --> 00:48:47.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if, for example,
Brother Smith did not want others

00:48:47.096 --> 00:48:50.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know details about his health problem?

00:48:50.307 --> 00:48:53.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to respect the privacy of others.

00:48:53.185 --> 00:48:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what if talking
about Sister Brown’s experience turns into,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, you know, she always brags
about her success in the ministry.”

00:49:02.486 --> 00:49:05.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our talk about others turns negative,

00:49:05.948 --> 00:49:08.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can develop into slander.

00:49:08.367 --> 00:49:11.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slander is making
deliberate, false statements

00:49:11.912 --> 00:49:15.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that damage another’s reputation.

00:49:15.207 --> 00:49:19.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now consider
how harmful gossip wrecks peace.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:26.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have spread harmful gossip
about someone and he hears about it,

00:49:26.135 --> 00:49:28.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you see him the next time,

00:49:28.929 --> 00:49:31.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will be the look on his face?

00:49:31.974 --> 00:49:36.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me Proverbs 25:23:

00:49:38.105 --> 00:49:41.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The north wind brings a downpour,

00:49:41.817 --> 00:49:46.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.”

00:49:47.114 --> 00:49:49.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
The north wind in Palestine

00:49:49.867 --> 00:49:52.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
brought dark clouds and rain.

00:49:52.245 --> 00:49:55.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, when the one you gossiped about

00:49:55.665 --> 00:49:59.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
catches wind of this and he sees you,

00:49:59.335 --> 00:50:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will have a gloomy, angry face.

00:50:02.505 --> 00:50:07.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be a storm
and a chilled relationship.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when that happens,

00:50:09.512 --> 00:50:13.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may feel very badly and apologize,

00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:16.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you may have damaged his reputation

00:50:16.269 --> 00:50:19.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that may be difficult to undo.

00:50:19.981 --> 00:50:22.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to this old Jewish story:

00:50:24.152 --> 00:50:29.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A man went about town
slandering the town’s wise man.

00:50:29.157 --> 00:50:32.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Later, the malicious gossiper
realized his wrong

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and went to the wise man
and asked for his forgiveness.

00:50:36.039 --> 00:50:40.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He offered to do
whatever was needed to make amends.

00:50:40.126 --> 00:50:43.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The wise man made one request.

00:50:43.004 --> 00:50:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He told the gossiper
to take a feather pillow,

00:50:46.716 --> 00:50:51.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘cut it open,
and scatter the feathers to the wind.

00:50:51.179 --> 00:50:54.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, the gossiper
was puzzled by this request,

00:50:54.307 --> 00:50:56.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but he did as instructed.

00:50:56.726 --> 00:50:59.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Then he returned to the wise man.

00:50:59.062 --> 00:51:01.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“Am I now forgiven?” he asked.

00:51:01.815 --> 00:51:06.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“First, go and gather all the feathers,”
the wise man responded.

00:51:06.403 --> 00:51:08.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“But, how can I?

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The wind has already scattered them.”

00:51:11.283 --> 00:51:13.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The wise man replied,

00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:18.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“It is as difficult to repair
the damage done by your words

00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:20.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it is to recover the feathers.”’

00:51:21.793 --> 00:51:26.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, once spoken,
hurtful words cannot be retrieved.

00:51:26.798 --> 00:51:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s not scatter feathers in the wind.

00:51:31.094 --> 00:51:33.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we spread rumors,

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can seriously disturb
the peace of many in the congregation.

00:51:37.934 --> 00:51:39.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find an example of this

00:51:39.936 --> 00:51:43.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 21:20, 21.

00:51:44.274 --> 00:51:48.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
The older men of the Jerusalem congregation
explained to Paul

00:51:48.904 --> 00:51:53.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some Jews
had spread a rumor among Jewish Christians

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:56.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had been teaching an apostasy,

00:51:56.578 --> 00:51:59.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking against the Law of Moses.

00:51:59.248 --> 00:52:02.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, this was a twisting of the facts.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul never spoke disrespectfully of the Law.

00:52:06.213 --> 00:52:08.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even went to synagogues

00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:11.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he reasoned
on the basis of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:52:11.885 --> 00:52:16.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such stories could have led
some newly converted Jewish Christians

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think that Paul
did not respect God’s arrangements,

00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:25.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this could have seriously disrupted
the peace of the congregation.

00:52:25.649 --> 00:52:27.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:52:27.943 --> 00:52:32.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the effect
that harmful gossip can have

00:52:32.114 --> 00:52:34.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the peace in a congregation.

00:52:36.035 --> 00:52:37.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:52:37.703 --> 00:52:40.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially as a pioneer,

00:52:40.122 --> 00:52:42.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of example is she setting?

00:52:42.124 --> 00:52:44.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has Emily stopped following her?

00:52:44.335 --> 00:52:46.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not yet, but she probably will.

00:52:46.837 --> 00:52:48.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alistair, what do you think?

00:52:49.298 --> 00:52:50.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
About what?

00:52:50.466 --> 00:52:53.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley’s posts on QuicPost.

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:56.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a problem?

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily has told me

00:52:58.224 --> 00:53:00.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re all just, “Look at me

00:53:00.267 --> 00:53:03.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my clothes, my hair, my makeup.”

00:53:03.896 --> 00:53:06.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even Celia agrees with her.

00:53:07.483 --> 00:53:12.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s very easy to take things
out of context on social media.

00:53:13.864 --> 00:53:18.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that I’ve done that and realized later

00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:21.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was wrong.

00:53:21.038 --> 00:53:23.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s a good point.

00:53:24.333 --> 00:53:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen, I don’t want to pull you away,

00:53:27.712 --> 00:53:31.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if you have a minute, would you mind
giving me a hand with these boxes?

00:53:31.132 --> 00:53:32.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:43.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help.

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:44.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
No problem.

00:53:44.979 --> 00:53:49.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake, back in the hall,
I know you were just expressing concern,

00:53:49.984 --> 00:53:52.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here’s something to consider.

00:53:52.612 --> 00:53:55.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
This principle is one of my favorites.

00:53:56.324 --> 00:53:59.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Proverbs

00:53:59.118 --> 00:54:02.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:54:04.249 --> 00:54:07.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The first to state his case seems right,

00:54:07.669 --> 00:54:11.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the other party comes
and cross-examines him.”

00:54:15.677 --> 00:54:17.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not sure I understand.

00:54:18.513 --> 00:54:21.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just means that sometimes

00:54:21.307 --> 00:54:23.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
we only hear one side of a story.

00:54:24.853 --> 00:54:28.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
And until we personally hear both,

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s best not to draw any conclusions.

00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:35.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even then, if it’s something negative,

00:54:35.613 --> 00:54:37.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t want to spread it

00:54:37.657 --> 00:54:40.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
any more than we’d want something spread
about ourselves.

00:54:44.915 --> 00:54:46.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I hadn’t considered that.

00:54:46.917 --> 00:54:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:52.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to apologize to Harry and Marie

00:54:54.633 --> 00:54:57.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have Emily talk directly to Haley.

00:54:59.179 --> 00:55:00.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:55:06.978 --> 00:55:09.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice what Jake said

00:55:09.231 --> 00:55:12.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the elder graciously helped him reason

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:15.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Proverbs 18:17?

00:55:15.028 --> 00:55:18.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “I had not considered that.”

00:55:18.699 --> 00:55:23.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jake just did not stop and think

00:55:23.078 --> 00:55:26.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he said
those negative things about Haley.

00:55:26.957 --> 00:55:30.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we “put away” harmful gossip

00:55:30.419 --> 00:55:32.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it begins?

00:55:32.421 --> 00:55:36.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Proverbs 15:28:

00:55:39.094 --> 00:55:43.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The heart of the righteous one
meditates before answering,

00:55:43.599 --> 00:55:45.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the mouth of the wicked

00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:48.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
blurts out bad things.”

00:55:49.396 --> 00:55:53.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
So before we say bad things about others,

00:55:53.025 --> 00:55:55.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to meditate.

00:55:55.027 --> 00:55:58.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this does not mean
a long-drawn-out process.

00:55:58.614 --> 00:56:02.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just requires a little thought.

00:56:02.034 --> 00:56:05.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
What thoughts could have stopped Jake

00:56:05.162 --> 00:56:10.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
from repeating his wife’s negative view
of Haley’s post?

00:56:10.167 --> 00:56:12.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have asked himself:

00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:15.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is what I am about to say true?

00:56:15.714 --> 00:56:18.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is it kind, loving?

00:56:18.843 --> 00:56:22.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How will Harry and Marie view Haley

00:56:22.346 --> 00:56:25.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they hear
those negative things about her?’

00:56:26.642 --> 00:56:30.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another principle
that will help us to put away harmful gossip

00:56:30.813 --> 00:56:33.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the so-called Golden Rule,

00:56:33.441 --> 00:56:36.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Luke 6:31.

00:56:36.193 --> 00:56:40.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Just as you
want men to do to you,

00:56:40.865 --> 00:56:43.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
do the same way to them.”

00:56:43.784 --> 00:56:46.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means showing empathy,

00:56:46.245 --> 00:56:48.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting ourselves
in the place of the other person,

00:56:48.873 --> 00:56:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asking ourselves,
‘How would I feel

00:56:52.168 --> 00:56:55.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
if someone said this about me?’

00:56:56.631 --> 00:57:01.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
One situation that may tempt us
to engage in harmful gossip

00:57:01.427 --> 00:57:05.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when we believe we
have been wronged by someone.

00:57:05.306 --> 00:57:07.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of applying the counsel

00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:10.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 5:23, 24

00:57:10.228 --> 00:57:12.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 18:15

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:15.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk to the person privately,

00:57:15.274 --> 00:57:19.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could start talking about it
to others who are not involved.

00:57:19.946 --> 00:57:23.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine if after finally talking
with the person

00:57:23.825 --> 00:57:27.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
you find out he actually
did not wrong you at all.

00:57:27.996 --> 00:57:31.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will have made the situation much worse.

00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:34.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whether we are right or wrong,

00:57:34.127 --> 00:57:36.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
engaging in hurtful speech

00:57:36.713 --> 00:57:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
will never improve a situation.

00:57:41.551 --> 00:57:46.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossip requires a speaker and a listener.

00:57:46.306 --> 00:57:49.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it wrong to listen to harmful gossip?

00:57:49.934 --> 00:57:51.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:57:51.478 --> 00:57:55.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what Proverbs 17:4 says:

00:57:55.273 --> 00:58:00.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A wicked man pays attention
to hurtful speech,

00:58:00.278 --> 00:58:05.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a deceptive man
listens to a malicious tongue.”

00:58:05.158 --> 00:58:07.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:11.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
In God’s eyes if we listen to hurtful,

00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:15.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
malicious speech, we too
bear a heavy responsibility.

00:58:15.961 --> 00:58:17.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
By listening to the gossiper,

00:58:17.963 --> 00:58:21.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are encouraging him to go on.

00:58:21.258 --> 00:58:23.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should you do?

00:58:23.552 --> 00:58:26.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without taking on an air
of self-righteousness,

00:58:26.638 --> 00:58:31.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could simply say,
“Let’s change the subject,”

00:58:31.184 --> 00:58:36.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “I don’t really feel comfortable
talking about this;

00:58:36.106 --> 00:58:39.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
after all, she is not here
to defend herself.”

00:58:40.902 --> 00:58:44.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we find that a brother or sister

00:58:44.072 --> 00:58:46.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
likes to gossip,

00:58:46.575 --> 00:58:49.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may find it easier to avoid harmful gossip

00:58:49.911 --> 00:58:54.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
by stopping close association
with that person.

00:58:54.541 --> 00:58:58.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 20:19 frankly counsels:

00:58:58.629 --> 00:59:03.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not associate
with one who loves to gossip.”

00:59:04.259 --> 00:59:09.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear friends,
let’s put away harmful gossip.

00:59:09.097 --> 00:59:11.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing so, we will maintain

00:59:11.433 --> 00:59:14.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
our precious peace and unity.

00:59:14.686 --> 00:59:16.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook,

00:59:16.688 --> 00:59:18.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:59:18.774 --> 00:59:22.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

00:59:22.236 --> 00:59:26.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers
—Uncontrolled Anger.”

00:59:34.665 --> 00:59:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is the main peace wrecker.

00:59:37.626 --> 00:59:41.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures tell us
that he is driven by “great anger.”

00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:45.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
His anger is malicious and uncontrolled.

00:59:45.759 --> 00:59:48.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would any sound-minded,
God-fearing person

00:59:48.679 --> 00:59:52.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
allow himself
to reflect Satan’s vicious anger?

00:59:52.141 --> 00:59:54.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:59:54.143 --> 00:59:57.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why all true servants of God
are determined

00:59:57.062 --> 01:00:00.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “put away” uncontrolled anger.

01:00:00.775 --> 01:00:05.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
But apart from uncontrolled anger,
is all anger bad?

01:00:05.404 --> 01:00:08.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible does not condemn all anger.

01:00:08.866 --> 01:00:13.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
It teaches us that anger is wrong
when it is uncontrolled or unjustified.

01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:17.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 4:26, God’s Word tells us:

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be wrathful, but [it adds] do not sin.”

01:00:21.254 --> 01:00:24.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, anger
may simply be a strong feeling

01:00:24.423 --> 01:00:28.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes into us
because of being upset or annoyed

01:00:28.135 --> 01:00:31.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
by something that we see as being wrong.

01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:34.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
That in itself is not bad.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what makes anger bad
is when it fills a person’s heart

01:00:39.105 --> 01:00:42.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he or she just loses control of it.

01:00:42.108 --> 01:00:44.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that happens,

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:48.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may cause a person
to act without a sound mind.

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:53.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who continue to lash out in anger
will not gain salvation.

01:00:53.453 --> 01:00:56.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 5:20 lists “fits of anger”

01:00:56.873 --> 01:01:00.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
among “the works of the flesh”
that will prevent a person

01:01:00.293 --> 01:01:02.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
from inheriting God’s Kingdom.

01:01:02.587 --> 01:01:06.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no place
for such ones in God’s new world.

01:01:06.883 --> 01:01:09.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brief review of how uncontrolled anger

01:01:09.677 --> 01:01:12.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrecks peace for ourselves and others

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
will highlight why this is so.

01:01:14.933 --> 01:01:16.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uncontrolled anger

01:01:16.935 --> 01:01:21.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
harms both the angry person
as well as those around him.

01:01:21.314 --> 01:01:24.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read at Proverbs 29:22

01:01:24.317 --> 01:01:27.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
that an angry person “stirs up strife,”

01:01:27.362 --> 01:01:31.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
adding that he “commits many transgressions.”

01:01:31.366 --> 01:01:35.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of these many sins is abusive speech.

01:01:35.036 --> 01:01:39.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must work to show restraint
when speaking with workmates,

01:01:39.207 --> 01:01:41.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
with strangers in the ministry,

01:01:41.459 --> 01:01:44.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers and sisters
in the congregation,

01:01:44.921 --> 01:01:47.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with our family members.

01:01:47.132 --> 01:01:50.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad feelings must be controlled.

01:01:50.594 --> 01:01:53.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abusive speech, ridicule, contempt,

01:01:53.722 --> 01:01:56.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hateful anger are wrong.

01:01:56.516 --> 01:02:00.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Giving vent to such feelings
can destroy precious friendships

01:02:00.645 --> 01:02:04.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
with other people and with Jehovah.

01:02:04.775 --> 01:02:08.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be like a volcano
that will not quiet down.

01:02:08.904 --> 01:02:13.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like an erupting volcano
will harm those living around it,

01:02:13.658 --> 01:02:17.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
so too a person who expresses intense anger

01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:19.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
will harm those living around him.

01:02:19.998 --> 01:02:22.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also damages himself.

01:02:22.459 --> 01:02:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

01:02:24.461 --> 01:02:29.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acting on anger often leads
to even more aggression,

01:02:29.424 --> 01:02:33.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
so uncontrolled anger
can also affect our own peace.

01:02:33.637 --> 01:02:37.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can cause us to do something
that we will later regret.

01:02:37.266 --> 01:02:40.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can have a negative effect on our health.

01:02:40.394 --> 01:02:43.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Medical studies show that uncontrolled anger

01:02:43.647 --> 01:02:47.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
can cause high blood pressure
and respiratory problems.

01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can also affect the liver and pancreas,

01:02:50.362 --> 01:02:54.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such anger can cause digestive problems.

01:02:54.158 --> 01:02:56.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a person becomes angry,

01:02:56.493 --> 01:02:59.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she will not always think clearly.

01:02:59.288 --> 01:03:04.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a fit of rage,
a person may become depressed.

01:03:04.043 --> 01:03:07.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder we read at Proverbs 14:30

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:12.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “a calm heart gives life to the body.”

01:03:12.801 --> 01:03:16.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disastrous consequences
of uncontrolled anger

01:03:16.555 --> 01:03:18.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
are illustrated in God’s Word

01:03:18.849 --> 01:03:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the actions of Simeon and Levi,

01:03:22.186 --> 01:03:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
sons of the patriarch Jacob.

01:03:24.855 --> 01:03:27.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they learned that their sister, Dinah,

01:03:27.108 --> 01:03:30.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
was violated by a man named Shechem,

01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:33.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read at Genesis 34:7

01:03:33.197 --> 01:03:37.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “they were offended and very angry.”

01:03:37.034 --> 01:03:39.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they had a valid reason to be angry,

01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:42.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they took their anger too far.

01:03:42.248 --> 01:03:44.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was uncontrolled.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:47.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simeon and Levi
took vengeance on Shechem.

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:51.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using deception, they attacked and killed

01:03:51.299 --> 01:03:53.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
every male in Shechem’s city.

01:03:53.968 --> 01:03:57.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, along with the other sons of Jacob,

01:03:57.221 --> 01:04:02.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
they plundered it and took
the women and little children captive.

01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dinah’s tragic experience
must have grieved Jacob greatly.

01:04:07.064 --> 01:04:11.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he condemned
his sons’ uncontrolled anger.

01:04:11.611 --> 01:04:15.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simeon and Levi
tried to justify their actions,

01:04:15.114 --> 01:04:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that was not the end of the matter,

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah was also displeased.

01:04:20.703 --> 01:04:24.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason, Jacob later foretold

01:04:24.165 --> 01:04:26.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the descendants of Simeon and Levi

01:04:26.793 --> 01:04:31.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
were to be scattered
among the tribes of Israel.

01:04:31.089 --> 01:04:34.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their uncontrolled anger brought disfavor

01:04:34.425 --> 01:04:38.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
from God and from their father, Jacob.

01:04:38.388 --> 01:04:42.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re wise to pay attention
to such Scriptural accounts

01:04:42.225 --> 01:04:47.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put away uncontrolled anger
and all of the harm that it brings.

01:04:47.981 --> 01:04:50.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:55.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a person
might be tempted to give in to anger.

01:05:03.997 --> 01:05:04.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Nana?

01:05:04.914 --> 01:05:05.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t forget eggs, dear.

01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:07.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, I didn’t forget.

01:05:07.292 --> 01:05:08.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you sure, love?

01:05:08.376 --> 01:05:09.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I won’t forget. OK.

01:05:09.544 --> 01:05:10.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

01:05:10.128 --> 01:05:11.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Love you.

01:05:11.129 --> 01:05:11.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

01:05:21.139 --> 01:05:22.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

01:05:26.394 --> 01:05:28.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, finally, I’ve caught you.

01:05:28.939 --> 01:05:30.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have a minute?

01:05:30.607 --> 01:05:31.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Emily.

01:05:31.566 --> 01:05:32.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we talk later?

01:05:32.234 --> 01:05:35.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really struggling this morning.

01:05:35.821 --> 01:05:38.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, it’s just that you’ve been so busy,
and I’ve been waiting for the right moment;

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d really just like to address it.

01:05:42.411 --> 01:05:45.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. What’s up?

01:05:45.205 --> 01:05:48.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just that I’ve noticed
your posts lately on QuicPost.

01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:51.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about them?

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:55.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do you really think they’re something
that a pioneer should be posting?

01:05:55.966 --> 01:05:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
What? What are you talking about?

01:05:58.594 --> 01:06:01.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think you’re bragging.

01:06:01.346 --> 01:06:03.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people? What people?

01:06:03.599 --> 01:06:05.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a business account.
I’ve got to show off my products.

01:06:05.934 --> 01:06:06.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know. I get that.

01:06:06.643 --> 01:06:07.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just—
I don’t know.

01:06:07.769 --> 01:06:10.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could feel like you’re drawing
a little too much attention to yourself.

01:06:10.647 --> 01:06:13.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would think like that? You?

01:06:13.358 --> 01:06:16.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not just me; Celia felt the same.

01:06:16.236 --> 01:06:18.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
You spoke to Celia about this?

01:06:19.698 --> 01:06:21.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to upset you.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake said that I needed to take . . .

01:06:22.493 --> 01:06:25.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake! So everyone thinks
my posts are inappropriate?

01:06:25.621 --> 01:06:27.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone, Haley.

01:06:27.915 --> 01:06:30.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

01:06:30.417 --> 01:06:32.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

01:06:32.252 --> 01:06:33.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! I can’t believe you.

01:06:33.921 --> 01:06:35.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who else have you spoken to?

01:06:35.297 --> 01:06:37.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are just such a gossip!

01:06:37.383 --> 01:06:38.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not gossiping. I was trying to . . .

01:06:38.592 --> 01:06:39.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are!

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:42.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just trying to help you,
if you would just listen to me.

01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:43.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so jealous!

01:06:43.722 --> 01:06:44.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d just listen to me.

01:06:44.515 --> 01:06:46.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, listen to this.

01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:50.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I expected more from you.

01:06:50.688 --> 01:06:52.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, what are you talking about?

01:06:52.982 --> 01:06:56.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossiping about my posts!

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

01:07:03.743 --> 01:07:05.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley,

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
wait, please!

01:07:19.008 --> 01:07:21.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you left feeling a bit tense?

01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:26.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you know
what uncontrolled anger can lead to.

01:07:27.308 --> 01:07:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we’ve defined uncontrolled anger

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and considered what it can lead to,

01:07:33.606 --> 01:07:35.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next question is,

01:07:35.608 --> 01:07:39.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we put away uncontrolled anger?

01:07:39.862 --> 01:07:44.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we need to recognize
the danger of uncontrolled anger.

01:07:44.617 --> 01:07:47.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 25:28 states

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:50.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “as a city broken through,
without a wall,

01:07:50.748 --> 01:07:54.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the man who cannot control his temper.”

01:07:54.919 --> 01:07:58.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strong city walls
were vital in ancient times.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without them a city
would quickly fall to invaders;

01:08:01.968 --> 01:08:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
likewise, so will those
who cannot control their temper.

01:08:06.222 --> 01:08:10.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
By losing control, they
make themselves vulnerable

01:08:10.185 --> 01:08:13.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the invasion of wrong thoughts

01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:17.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
—thoughts that can cause them
to hurt themselves and others.

01:08:17.233 --> 01:08:21.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uncontrolled anger can do just that.

01:08:21.362 --> 01:08:24.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, after recognizing the danger,

01:08:24.532 --> 01:08:28.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must pause and then deal with the anger

01:08:28.078 --> 01:08:31.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it causes us
to do something that we will regret.

01:08:31.915 --> 01:08:33.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
When anger grows within us,

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:37.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re wise to recall
what happened with Simeon and Levi.

01:08:37.796 --> 01:08:40.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might also recall what happened

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:43.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the video dramatization
that we just viewed.

01:08:43.718 --> 01:08:45.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, in each case,

01:08:45.929 --> 01:08:49.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
pausing before reacting out of anger

01:08:49.015 --> 01:08:52.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have spared
much pain and heartache, true?

01:08:52.435 --> 01:08:54.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we have this warning

01:08:54.437 --> 01:08:57.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 17:14:

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:02.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before the quarrel breaks out,
take your leave.”

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind,
each of us should ask himself:

01:09:05.449 --> 01:09:08.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do I tend to jump to conclusions

01:09:08.034 --> 01:09:10.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when I don’t have all the facts?

01:09:10.245 --> 01:09:14.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If so, can I take my leave
and put away anger

01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:16.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it starts to build up?’

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:18.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspired advice

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:23.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at James 1:19 will help us to do so

01:09:23.133 --> 01:09:27.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but only if we make
a sincere and determined effort

01:09:27.387 --> 01:09:29.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply what it says.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:34.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that verse—James 1:19.

01:09:34.728 --> 01:09:37.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we find some simple steps

01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:41.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us put away uncontrolled anger.

01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:43.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Know this, my beloved brothers:

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:46.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everyone must be quick to listen,

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:50.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
slow to speak, slow to anger.”

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:55.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we ask Jehovah to help us with this,

01:09:55.332 --> 01:09:57.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
namely to “be quick to listen,

01:09:57.751 --> 01:10:00.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
slow to speak, slow to anger,”

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:02.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will assist us to do so.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:05.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help us
to see the facts of the matter,

01:10:05.592 --> 01:10:10.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
show understanding,
and then put away uncontrolled anger.

01:10:11.348 --> 01:10:13.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
A word of caution, though:

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
To succeed in doing our part,

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:20.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must choose our associates wisely.

01:10:20.274 --> 01:10:22.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could undermine all of our good work

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:26.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s help in controlling our anger

01:10:26.614 --> 01:10:29.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we choose associates who are arrogant,

01:10:29.784 --> 01:10:34.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
opinionated, or quick to become angry.

01:10:34.789 --> 01:10:37.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding someone who is disposed to rage,

01:10:37.958 --> 01:10:41.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 22:25 warns:

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:45.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never learn his ways.”

01:10:45.049 --> 01:10:48.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve enjoyed
another outstanding series of talks

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
that should help us to keep awake,

01:10:50.388 --> 01:10:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
maintain fine conduct,

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:56.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and escape the judgment
that will soon come on this world.

01:10:56.769 --> 01:10:59.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this symposium has emphasized,

01:10:59.438 --> 01:11:03.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must do our utmost
to continue to put away peace wreckers

01:11:03.609 --> 01:11:07.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as inappropriate boasting, envy,

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:09.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
dishonesty, harmful gossip,

01:11:09.907 --> 01:11:12.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
and uncontrolled anger.

01:11:12.493 --> 01:11:16.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have a problem
with any of the peacemaking qualities

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have discussed in this symposium,

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:23.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
seek Jehovah’s help
to change and then work at it.

01:11:23.463 --> 01:11:26.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sincere efforts to pursue peace

01:11:26.424 --> 01:11:28.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers and our sisters

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
will influence how earnestly
we are awaiting “Jehovah’s day”

01:11:33.306 --> 01:11:35.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his promised new world.

01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:39.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our genuine efforts
will affect our hearts

01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:42.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will be noticed by our heavenly Father.

01:11:42.774 --> 01:11:46.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in his great mercy,

01:11:46.027 --> 01:11:49.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will consider us
to be, as his Word says,

01:11:49.948 --> 01:11:54.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“spotless and unblemished and in peace”

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:57.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both with him
and with our fellow worshippers.

01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:04.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers, for helping us
to strengthen our bond of unity.

01:12:06.464 --> 01:12:08.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the rebellion in Eden,

01:12:08.883 --> 01:12:13.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace among mankind as a whole
has been lost.

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:17.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite this, Jehovah has given peace

01:12:17.058 --> 01:12:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who trust in him.

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has he done so in the past,

01:12:23.273 --> 01:12:27.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how does this strengthen
our faith in him today?

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to enjoy Part 1
of the documentary

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:35.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah Guides Us in the Way of Peace.</i>

01:12:50.008 --> 01:12:53.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our military forces are committed to peace.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have chosen peace.

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our wish, our prayer, is for peace.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:02.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
We yearn for peace.

01:13:02.354 --> 01:13:05.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for peace.

01:13:07.985 --> 01:13:09.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
For thousands

01:13:09.361 --> 01:13:11.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
of years, humans have tried

01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:13.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find peace

01:13:18.245 --> 01:13:20.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peace as individuals,

01:13:23.125 --> 01:13:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace as families,

01:13:29.506 --> 01:13:32.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace for the entire human race.

01:13:35.596 --> 01:13:39.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to lay the foundation of peace
for generations to come.

01:13:39.266 --> 01:13:41.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to do the hard work now

01:13:41.644 --> 01:13:45.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
so our children and our grandchildren
can grow up in a peaceful world.

01:13:48.484 --> 01:13:50.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
The future we want:

01:13:51.946 --> 01:13:54.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
opportunity and security for our families,

01:13:56.117 --> 01:13:58.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
a rising standard of living,

01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:02.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids

01:14:08.212 --> 01:14:10.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all that is within our reach.

01:14:13.175 --> 01:14:15.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, despite humans’ best efforts,

01:14:17.638 --> 01:14:19.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace

01:14:20.725 --> 01:14:22.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been elusive.

01:14:42.955 --> 01:14:44.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
For millenniums,

01:14:44.957 --> 01:14:47.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
rulers and governments
have tried to achieve peace

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:48.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
through treaties,

01:14:48.503 --> 01:14:50.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
resolutions,

01:14:50.046 --> 01:14:51.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
summits

01:14:51.422 --> 01:14:53.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, ironically, war.

01:15:03.851 --> 01:15:07.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our peace as humans
is more fragile than ever.

01:15:09.023 --> 01:15:11.734 line:10% position:50% align:center
Man’s efforts to bring about lasting peace

01:15:11.734 --> 01:15:14.779 line:10% position:50% align:center
have failed time and time again.

01:15:15.655 --> 01:15:18.366 line:10% position:50% align:center
This isn’t surprising to us.

01:15:18.366 --> 01:15:22.078 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 10:23 tells us:

01:15:22.078 --> 01:15:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It does not belong to man . . .
to direct his step.”

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:31.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans were simply not designed
to rule themselves.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.675 line:10% position:50% align:center
Good health, safety, overall well-being

01:15:35.675 --> 01:15:37.594 line:10% position:50% align:center
—these are becoming harder to find

01:15:37.594 --> 01:15:39.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
as we move further into what the Bible

01:15:39.387 --> 01:15:42.474 line:10% position:50% align:center
refers to as “the last days.”

01:15:42.474 --> 01:15:45.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
As long as human rule continues,

01:15:45.393 --> 01:15:48.104 line:10% position:50% align:center
disunity will continue.

01:15:48.104 --> 01:15:50.398 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s true that global peace

01:15:50.398 --> 01:15:53.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
cannot be obtained by human efforts alone.

01:15:53.527 --> 01:15:55.445 line:10% position:50% align:center
But those who are close to God

01:15:55.445 --> 01:15:58.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
can find peace of mind right now.

01:15:58.073 --> 01:16:01.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 48:17, 18 says:

01:16:01.409 --> 01:16:04.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

01:16:04.162 --> 01:16:06.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:08.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One guiding you

01:16:08.208 --> 01:16:10.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the way you should walk.

01:16:10.085 --> 01:16:12.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If only you would pay attention

01:16:12.462 --> 01:16:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to my commandments!

01:16:14.297 --> 01:16:15.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then your peace

01:16:15.966 --> 01:16:18.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
would become just like a river.”

01:16:18.427 --> 01:16:20.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s only Jehovah

01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:22.931 line:10% position:50% align:center
who has the ability to guide humans

01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:25.475 line:10% position:50% align:center
to real, lasting peace.

01:16:25.475 --> 01:16:27.728 line:10% position:50% align:center
He promises he will bring this about.

01:16:27.728 --> 01:16:29.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until this happens,

01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:31.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continues to provide ways

01:16:31.815 --> 01:16:34.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to experience peace now.

01:16:34.109 --> 01:16:36.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do that?

01:16:36.028 --> 01:16:40.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
By giving us “the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding.”

01:16:55.464 --> 01:16:58.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
We aren’t the only ones
whose peace has been challenged.

01:16:58.133 --> 01:17:01.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word is filled
with accounts of faithful servants

01:17:01.345 --> 01:17:03.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose peace was challenged

01:17:03.389 --> 01:17:05.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the dominating forces of their day.

01:17:05.808 --> 01:17:09.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we study and meditate on these accounts,

01:17:09.228 --> 01:17:11.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lessons we learn from them

01:17:11.605 --> 01:17:16.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to trust in Jehovah
as he guides us to peace.

01:17:16.652 --> 01:17:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding how these accounts
relate to Jehovah’s purpose to bring peace

01:17:20.823 --> 01:17:24.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of his Messianic Kingdom
gives us confidence

01:17:24.285 --> 01:17:26.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his purpose never fails

01:17:26.454 --> 01:17:29.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will support
and guide us on into the future.

01:17:29.748 --> 01:17:31.417 line:10% position:50% align:center
One of Jehovah’s prophets

01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:34.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
who learned this lesson firsthand was Jonah.

01:17:36.005 --> 01:17:39.592 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jonah lived in the ninth century B.C.E.

01:17:39.592 --> 01:17:42.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assigned Jonah to go to Nineveh,

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:44.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
a city of the Assyrian Empire.

01:17:45.181 --> 01:17:47.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on what he knew about Nineveh,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah considered this to be

01:17:49.226 --> 01:17:51.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
an intimidating and threatening assignment.

01:17:52.313 --> 01:17:55.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Assyrians were known as fierce warriors,

01:17:55.316 --> 01:17:57.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Nineveh itself was later described

01:17:57.735 --> 01:18:00.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a “city of bloodshed.”

01:18:01.822 --> 01:18:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you can understand Jonah’s trepidation
when Jehovah asks him

01:18:05.284 --> 01:18:06.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proclaim a judgment message

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:08.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
against this imposing city

01:18:08.412 --> 01:18:09.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its pagan inhabitants.

01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:16.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an attempt to find peace,

01:18:16.712 --> 01:18:20.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah decides to go far away from Nineveh

01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:22.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
and boards a boat headed for Tarshish.

01:18:27.974 --> 01:18:29.809 line:10% position:50% align:center
Tarshish is generally associated

01:18:29.809 --> 01:18:31.561 line:10% position:50% align:center
with modern-day Spain.

01:18:31.561 --> 01:18:33.146 line:10% position:50% align:center
So from Israel,

01:18:33.146 --> 01:18:35.023 line:10% position:50% align:center
this is the complete opposite direction

01:18:35.023 --> 01:18:36.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Nineveh.

01:18:39.777 --> 01:18:42.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah found anything but peace.

01:18:47.994 --> 01:18:49.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

01:18:55.835 --> 01:18:57.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the gods.

01:18:57.337 --> 01:18:58.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Furl the sail!

01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was no ordinary storm.

01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:11.643 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was so severe that the ship

01:19:11.643 --> 01:19:13.311 line:10% position:50% align:center
was in danger of being wrecked.

01:19:13.311 --> 01:19:17.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Captain, we’re taking on too much water!

01:19:17.023 --> 01:19:18.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
This storm is from the gods!

01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:20.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baal!

01:19:20.026 --> 01:19:22.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eshmun!

01:19:22.362 --> 01:19:24.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
The crew cried out to their gods,

01:19:24.865 --> 01:19:28.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jonah knew the true Source of the storm.

01:19:28.243 --> 01:19:29.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now he accepts

01:19:29.995 --> 01:19:32.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
personal responsibility for the situation.

01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:35.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lift me up

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and throw me into the sea,

01:19:36.793 --> 01:19:38.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sea will calm down for you;

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:41.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I know that it’s because of me

01:19:41.339 --> 01:19:43.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this violent storm has come upon you.

01:19:45.427 --> 01:19:48.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the courage it took

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jonah to make this request?

01:19:51.433 --> 01:19:55.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had no way of knowing
if Jehovah would save him,

01:19:55.062 --> 01:19:58.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he did not want others
to perish on his account.

01:20:10.452 --> 01:20:14.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his mercy, Jehovah spares Jonah’s life.

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:16.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
How am I still alive?

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:18.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will become of me?

01:20:19.795 --> 01:20:21.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
When faced

01:20:21.255 --> 01:20:22.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a difficult assignment,

01:20:22.464 --> 01:20:25.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah “got up to run away from Jehovah

01:20:25.676 --> 01:20:27.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Tarshish.”

01:20:27.886 --> 01:20:30.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah’s conscience had to bother him;

01:20:30.305 --> 01:20:32.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had to be questioning his decision.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:36.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tried to take matters into his own hands,

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:39.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
tried to find his own peace.

01:20:39.064 --> 01:20:41.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where does he find himself?

01:20:41.066 --> 01:20:43.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the belly of a fish!

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:46.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet he calls to Jehovah
in a moment of despair.

01:20:48.407 --> 01:20:50.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah,

01:20:52.161 --> 01:20:54.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of the depths of the Grave,

01:20:54.872 --> 01:20:57.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cry to you for help.

01:20:57.917 --> 01:21:00.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please hear my voice.

01:21:03.255 --> 01:21:06.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I have vowed, I will pay.

01:21:08.386 --> 01:21:09.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah could have reasoned

01:21:09.804 --> 01:21:13.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this was the end
of his assignment as Jehovah’s prophet.

01:21:16.727 --> 01:21:20.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, he did disobey direction.

01:21:21.565 --> 01:21:23.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
So likely, he was surprised

01:21:23.859 --> 01:21:26.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear the word of Jehovah come to him

01:21:26.153 --> 01:21:27.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
a second time.

01:21:35.079 --> 01:21:37.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah!

01:21:37.206 --> 01:21:39.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get up,

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to Nineveh the great city,

01:21:41.544 --> 01:21:43.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and proclaim to her

01:21:43.379 --> 01:21:45.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
the message that I tell you.

01:21:47.925 --> 01:21:49.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:51.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

01:21:51.095 --> 01:21:52.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

01:21:58.686 --> 01:22:01.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, Jonah trusted in himself

01:22:01.564 --> 01:22:03.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and didn’t understand

01:22:03.316 --> 01:22:06.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would protect him
from the violent Assyrians.

01:22:06.819 --> 01:22:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after being given
a second chance, what happens?

01:22:09.405 --> 01:22:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then he puts aside

01:22:11.074 --> 01:22:13.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
his human concerns

01:22:14.661 --> 01:22:16.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looks to Jehovah for protection.

01:22:24.838 --> 01:22:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just 40 days more,

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nineveh will be overthrown.

01:22:30.885 --> 01:22:33.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, the true God, has spoken.

01:22:33.179 --> 01:22:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
This city will be destroyed.

01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nineveh will be overthrown.

01:22:38.309 --> 01:22:41.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
The true God will overthrow Nineveh.

01:22:44.357 --> 01:22:46.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The true God has spoken.

01:22:46.318 --> 01:22:48.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, the king himself repents

01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:49.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and orders everyone

01:22:49.696 --> 01:22:52.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Nineveh to do the same.

01:22:52.032 --> 01:22:54.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah learned a valuable lesson

01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:56.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this experience.

01:22:57.537 --> 01:22:59.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
By originally running away from Nineveh,

01:22:59.831 --> 01:23:01.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
he chose to trust in himself

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:04.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than putting his trust in Jehovah.

01:23:04.795 --> 01:23:07.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you Jonah?

01:23:07.881 --> 01:23:09.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am.

01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:11.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mommy says you saved us.

01:23:13.428 --> 01:23:16.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah saved you.

01:23:17.057 --> 01:23:21.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just—I was just a messenger.

01:23:23.605 --> 01:23:25.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah learned

01:23:25.482 --> 01:23:27.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
that without a doubt

01:23:27.067 --> 01:23:30.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah protects those
who trust and obey Him.

01:23:30.112 --> 01:23:32.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah has asked you to do something,

01:23:32.322 --> 01:23:34.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he’s asked me to do something,

01:23:34.533 --> 01:23:36.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he’s leading us,

01:23:36.743 --> 01:23:40.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
he absolutely will guide us through it.

01:23:40.122 --> 01:23:43.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah’s account proves this.

01:23:44.126 --> 01:23:46.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the Ninevites were spared

01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:49.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they repented (that’s true),

01:23:49.548 --> 01:23:51.592 line:10% position:50% align:center
Assyria later

01:23:51.592 --> 01:23:54.094 line:10% position:50% align:center
returned to its evil, wicked ways.

01:23:54.845 --> 01:23:56.346 line:10% position:50% align:center
About a century

01:23:56.346 --> 01:23:58.474 line:10% position:50% align:center
after Jonah’s judgment message,

01:23:58.474 --> 01:24:01.226 line:10% position:50% align:center
King Sennacherib of Assyria brought

01:24:01.226 --> 01:24:03.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
his armies against the cities of Judah,

01:24:03.771 --> 01:24:05.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the city he wanted most

01:24:05.856 --> 01:24:08.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jerusalem.

01:24:09.485 --> 01:24:11.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Hezekiah of Judah

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
was an outstanding king

01:24:12.905 --> 01:24:15.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
who “held fast to Jehovah.”

01:24:15.366 --> 01:24:17.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the beginning of his reign,

01:24:17.618 --> 01:24:19.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
he proved to be zealous for true worship

01:24:19.912 --> 01:24:23.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only in Judah but in all of Israel.

01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:27.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah had done so much
to stand up for pure worship,

01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:29.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet now he is faced with the prospect

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:31.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a siege against Jerusalem

01:24:31.382 --> 01:24:33.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Sennacherib’s armies.

01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:40.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah agrees to pay Sennacherib

01:24:40.015 --> 01:24:42.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
a tribute in return for peace.

01:24:42.268 --> 01:24:45.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, the armies continue their conquests,

01:24:45.855 --> 01:24:48.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Sennacherib and his men besiege

01:24:48.107 --> 01:24:49.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
the strongly fortified city of Lachish.

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
From here,

01:24:55.239 --> 01:24:57.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sennacherib sends a part of his army

01:24:57.325 --> 01:25:00.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as military chiefs to Jerusalem

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:02.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an attempt to demand surrender.

01:25:03.706 --> 01:25:05.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spokesman for the group was the Rabshakeh,

01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
who spoke Hebrew fluently.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loudly ridiculed Hezekiah

01:25:11.756 --> 01:25:13.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and taunted Jehovah,

01:25:13.758 --> 01:25:17.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
boasting that Jehovah
was no match against King Sennacherib.

01:25:17.595 --> 01:25:19.639 line:10% position:50% align:center
Imagine what these soldiers

01:25:19.639 --> 01:25:20.932 line:10% position:50% align:center
must have been thinking.

01:25:20.932 --> 01:25:23.976 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sennacherib’s armies were on a warpath,

01:25:23.976 --> 01:25:26.562 line:10% position:50% align:center
taking city after city.

01:25:28.064 --> 01:25:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
To Hezekiah, this was a defining moment.

01:25:31.401 --> 01:25:34.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to decide if he would trust in himself

01:25:34.487 --> 01:25:36.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
or trust in Jehovah.

01:25:40.994 --> 01:25:42.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
My brothers,

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must remember that Jehovah

01:25:44.664 --> 01:25:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
is fully able to rescue us,

01:25:45.748 --> 01:25:47.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he has in times past.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:47.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word . . .

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:48.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Hezekiah,

01:25:50.962 --> 01:25:53.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
will you not even now face the facts?

01:25:53.756 --> 01:25:56.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are trapped!

01:25:56.259 --> 01:25:58.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Assyrians are at our gate,

01:25:58.303 --> 01:25:59.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you cling to the belief

01:25:59.679 --> 01:26:02.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
that nothing bad will happen.

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will destroy everything

01:26:04.017 --> 01:26:05.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
you so hope to preserve

01:26:05.351 --> 01:26:07.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the temple, Jerusalem,

01:26:07.354 --> 01:26:08.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
our very lives.

01:26:08.438 --> 01:26:09.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shebna, I am not blind

01:26:09.272 --> 01:26:11.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the dangers that we face.

01:26:11.524 --> 01:26:13.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
I too am afraid.

01:26:13.693 --> 01:26:15.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if Jehovah

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:16.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows Jerusalem to fall,

01:26:16.321 --> 01:26:18.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
so be it.

01:26:18.114 --> 01:26:20.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we give up what belongs to Jehovah?

01:26:23.036 --> 01:26:24.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as a man of faith,

01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:27.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah focused on Jehovah’s ability

01:26:27.207 --> 01:26:28.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save His people

01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:33.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite Sennacherib’s
continued advances toward Jerusalem.

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:40.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m curious about this king of yours.

01:26:40.053 --> 01:26:41.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who does he think

01:26:41.638 --> 01:26:43.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come to save him from me?

01:26:45.809 --> 01:26:49.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, your God,

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
is weak!

01:26:51.064 --> 01:26:55.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will cringe before my god Asshur.

01:26:58.196 --> 01:26:59.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah remained

01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:03.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
determined to trust in Jehovah.

01:27:03.035 --> 01:27:07.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
This decision required
a tremendous amount of faith,

01:27:07.497 --> 01:27:10.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially with more than

01:27:10.167 --> 01:27:13.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
185,000 Assyrian soldiers

01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:15.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
headed toward Jerusalem.

01:27:19.259 --> 01:27:21.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of trusting in himself,

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:24.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
he continued to look

01:27:24.139 --> 01:27:28.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah as the Source of true peace

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
even as an attack seemed imminent.

01:27:36.235 --> 01:27:38.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah again

01:27:38.278 --> 01:27:41.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed just how insignificant

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:45.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
human rulers are in comparison to him.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah learned

01:28:04.722 --> 01:28:07.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when a way out seems impossible,

01:28:07.016 --> 01:28:10.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting in Jehovah always leads to success.

01:28:11.854 --> 01:28:15.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rewarded that trust
with victory over the Assyrians.

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:20.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a lesson
we can apply now and in the near future.

01:28:20.988 --> 01:28:24.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may be situations
when true worshippers seem trapped,

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never forget
that Jehovah is all-powerful.

01:28:28.663 --> 01:28:30.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s leading his people,

01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:34.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can follow
his guidance with full confidence.

01:28:34.085 --> 01:28:38.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will protect those
who trust in him at Armageddon.

01:28:38.631 --> 01:28:41.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem remained safe

01:28:41.134 --> 01:28:43.386 line:10% position:50% align:center
against attack for the time being,

01:28:43.386 --> 01:28:46.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
but peaceful conditions didn’t last long.

01:28:48.641 --> 01:28:50.893 line:10% position:50% align:center
Hezekiah’s son Manasseh

01:28:50.893 --> 01:28:52.937 line:10% position:50% align:center
did what was detestable

01:28:52.937 --> 01:28:54.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the eyes of Jehovah.

01:28:54.272 --> 01:28:55.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brought back Baal worship

01:28:55.690 --> 01:28:58.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and personally took its vilest practices

01:28:58.568 --> 01:29:00.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
to extremes,

01:29:00.153 --> 01:29:02.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
even putting a carved image of a false god

01:29:02.363 --> 01:29:05.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
right inside Jehovah’s temple.

01:29:05.033 --> 01:29:07.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here you have a king

01:29:07.368 --> 01:29:11.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s supposed to be protecting
the people from idolatrous influence

01:29:11.247 --> 01:29:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing the exact opposite
—building altars to false gods.

01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:19.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even went so far
as to pass his own sons through the fire,

01:29:19.088 --> 01:29:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacrificing them to these gods.

01:29:21.424 --> 01:29:23.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace with God that Hezekiah

01:29:23.802 --> 01:29:26.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked so hard to achieve for the nation

01:29:26.513 --> 01:29:29.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
is now reversed by the actions of his son.

01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of this,

01:29:31.518 --> 01:29:33.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah punished Manasseh severely.

01:29:33.812 --> 01:29:35.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed the king of Assyria

01:29:35.855 --> 01:29:38.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take him captive to Babylon.

01:29:38.316 --> 01:29:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
While in captivity,

01:29:40.443 --> 01:29:42.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Manasseh ultimately repented.

01:29:42.904 --> 01:29:44.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbled himself,

01:29:44.906 --> 01:29:46.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he stayed faithful

01:29:46.908 --> 01:29:48.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
right to the end of his life.

01:29:48.326 --> 01:29:49.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grandfather!

01:29:49.369 --> 01:29:50.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can imagine him impressing

01:29:50.912 --> 01:29:52.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
the importance of faithfulness

01:29:52.872 --> 01:29:55.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah on his young grandson Josiah.

01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:57.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to me.

01:29:58.962 --> 01:30:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is holy,

01:30:02.632 --> 01:30:05.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you must serve him

01:30:05.218 --> 01:30:07.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way he wants us to.

01:30:08.513 --> 01:30:10.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
All other gods

01:30:12.309 --> 01:30:14.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
are powerless.

01:30:14.436 --> 01:30:16.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, in spite of all this,

01:30:17.147 --> 01:30:18.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people still thought

01:30:18.899 --> 01:30:21.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could serve Jehovah and Baal.

01:30:21.985 --> 01:30:24.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after becoming king,

01:30:24.738 --> 01:30:28.158 line:10% position:50% align:center
Josiah started a campaign against idolatry.

01:30:29.159 --> 01:30:30.535 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen these cheaper.

01:30:32.162 --> 01:30:33.997 line:10% position:50% align:center
Take it or leave it.

01:30:40.879 --> 01:30:42.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
We start here!

01:30:44.925 --> 01:30:46.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

01:30:59.189 --> 01:31:01.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what we will do to every false god in the land.

01:31:04.278 --> 01:31:07.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tore down altars used for false worship,

01:31:07.156 --> 01:31:10.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacred poles, images, and statues.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was intent 
on cleansing the land of idolatry.

01:31:13.287 --> 01:31:16.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he showed remarkable courage

01:31:16.123 --> 01:31:20.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stand up for true worship
at a time when few were doing so.

01:31:22.046 --> 01:31:25.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt this was a difficult task.

01:31:25.549 --> 01:31:28.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, he may have even wondered

01:31:28.177 --> 01:31:29.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was doing the right thing.

01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:31.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible Jehovah provided Josiah

01:31:31.889 --> 01:31:34.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
with assurance from the prophet Jeremiah.

01:31:36.936 --> 01:31:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jehovah says: “Look!

01:31:40.439 --> 01:31:42.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A son named Josiah

01:31:42.316 --> 01:31:44.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be born to the house of David!

01:31:44.735 --> 01:31:47.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will sacrifice on you

01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:49.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the priests of the high places,

01:31:49.657 --> 01:31:52.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those making sacrificial smoke on you,

01:31:54.078 --> 01:31:56.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will burn human bones on you.”

01:31:58.374 --> 01:32:00.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
That prophecy

01:32:00.209 --> 01:32:04.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
made over 300 years earlier confirmed

01:32:04.505 --> 01:32:09.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Josiah was the one
prophesied to act against false worship.

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:13.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may have given Josiah
even greater incentive and courage

01:32:13.681 --> 01:32:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue his campaign,

01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:18.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
which now included repairing the temple.

01:32:18.394 --> 01:32:20.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
These actions contributed

01:32:20.688 --> 01:32:21.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the peaceful conditions

01:32:21.814 --> 01:32:24.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
that elevated pure worship.

01:32:25.693 --> 01:32:27.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josiah did so much

01:32:27.528 --> 01:32:28.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
to restore pure worship.

01:32:28.905 --> 01:32:30.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we love him.

01:32:30.782 --> 01:32:33.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, the peoples’ heart condition
remained polluted,

01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:36.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the nation required severe discipline.

01:32:37.705 --> 01:32:39.207 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah prophesied

01:32:39.207 --> 01:32:40.750 line:10% position:50% align:center
a conquest of the Babylonians

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:42.794 line:10% position:50% align:center
against Judah.

01:32:42.794 --> 01:32:44.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
All this land

01:32:44.837 --> 01:32:46.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
will be reduced to ruins,

01:32:46.589 --> 01:32:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this land and its inhabitants

01:32:48.424 --> 01:32:50.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have to serve the king of Babylon

01:32:50.593 --> 01:32:52.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 70 years.

01:32:52.595 --> 01:32:54.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel himself may have heard

01:32:54.639 --> 01:32:56.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah speak those words.

01:32:56.266 --> 01:32:57.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he certainly

01:32:57.642 --> 01:33:01.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
saw it come true as he and his family
were exiled to Babylon.

01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:05.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about peace being interrupted!

01:33:05.483 --> 01:33:08.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was a young Judean prince taken

01:33:08.194 --> 01:33:09.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his homeland

01:33:09.195 --> 01:33:11.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and separated from his family.

01:33:14.951 --> 01:33:17.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
But being chosen to receive special training

01:33:17.203 --> 01:33:19.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar

01:33:19.664 --> 01:33:22.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
presented another set of challenges.

01:33:22.167 --> 01:33:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
The entire way

01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:28.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Babylonian life was contrary
to what Daniel knew growing up in Judah.

01:33:28.465 --> 01:33:31.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Daniel was determined
not to pollute himself

01:33:31.551 --> 01:33:34.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
with foods Jehovah would not approve of.

01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:38.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah blessed

01:33:38.892 --> 01:33:40.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel’s determination to be faithful,

01:33:40.352 --> 01:33:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he was selected to serve

01:33:42.145 --> 01:33:44.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of King Nebuchadnezzar’s wise men.

01:33:52.781 --> 01:33:55.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar was a warrior-king

01:33:55.283 --> 01:33:57.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
intent on building a great empire.

01:33:58.328 --> 01:34:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
After he officially

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
took the throne
in 624 B.C.E., his domain

01:34:03.584 --> 01:34:05.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
grew with each conquest.

01:34:05.627 --> 01:34:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babylon became an epicenter
of trade and commerce.

01:34:11.091 --> 01:34:13.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar undertook

01:34:13.093 --> 01:34:15.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
huge building projects throughout the city,

01:34:15.095 --> 01:34:17.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
which made the city seem impregnable.

01:34:19.224 --> 01:34:23.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the sense of security
the inhabitants of Babylon must have felt,

01:34:23.687 --> 01:34:26.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
locked safely behind the city’s walls.

01:34:27.733 --> 01:34:29.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar

01:34:29.568 --> 01:34:30.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
attributed the prosperity

01:34:30.819 --> 01:34:32.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and security all around him

01:34:32.571 --> 01:34:34.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the power of his false gods.

01:34:34.782 --> 01:34:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
The chief of these false gods
was Marduk, the god of war.

01:34:41.205 --> 01:34:45.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, these false gods and their priests
would prove to be worthless.

01:34:46.418 --> 01:34:48.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
One night,

01:34:48.462 --> 01:34:50.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Nebuchadnezzar had a strange dream.

01:35:00.432 --> 01:35:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Call the wise men!

01:35:04.311 --> 01:35:05.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

01:35:05.604 --> 01:35:06.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Relate the dream to your servants.

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will tell the interpretation.

01:35:08.524 --> 01:35:09.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t make the dream known to me

01:35:11.527 --> 01:35:13.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the interpretation,

01:35:13.529 --> 01:35:15.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll be dismembered,

01:35:15.156 --> 01:35:17.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your houses will be turned into public latrines.

01:35:19.452 --> 01:35:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is not a man on earth

01:35:21.078 --> 01:35:22.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can do what the king demands.

01:35:22.538 --> 01:35:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
What the king is asking is difficult.

01:35:24.206 --> 01:35:25.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one exists

01:35:25.416 --> 01:35:27.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could tell this to the king except

01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:29.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
—except the gods.

01:35:35.509 --> 01:35:36.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seize them!

01:35:38.429 --> 01:35:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kill them!

01:35:42.433 --> 01:35:43.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerah.

01:35:43.434 --> 01:35:44.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re in danger.

01:35:44.519 --> 01:35:45.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? What happened?

01:35:45.394 --> 01:35:46.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t hear everything,

01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:47.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the wise men angered the king.

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:50.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone is to be executed by dawn.

01:35:50.316 --> 01:35:53.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bring Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah here.

01:35:53.444 --> 01:35:55.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll try to learn more.

01:35:55.488 --> 01:35:58.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
This edict to kill all the wise men

01:35:58.032 --> 01:36:01.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
would also include Daniel and his companions.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s look at this
from Daniel’s perspective.

01:36:03.871 --> 01:36:06.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here he is, a young man in a foreign land,

01:36:06.207 --> 01:36:10.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving in the court of one
of the most powerful and violent men alive.

01:36:10.878 --> 01:36:13.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that man is now demanding

01:36:13.214 --> 01:36:16.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
that someone, in effect, read his mind:

01:36:16.134 --> 01:36:18.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Tell me my dream,

01:36:18.178 --> 01:36:20.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tell me what it means.”

01:36:22.182 --> 01:36:23.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
O king,

01:36:23.975 --> 01:36:27.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

01:36:27.687 --> 01:36:30.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows your dream and what it means.

01:36:32.734 --> 01:36:34.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, where is your God?

01:36:34.319 --> 01:36:35.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where?

01:36:37.781 --> 01:36:42.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
I believe that he—
I know that he will reveal it to me.

01:36:42.911 --> 01:36:45.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, give me time.

01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:49.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel is not acting

01:36:49.793 --> 01:36:51.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
on previous experience.

01:36:51.962 --> 01:36:55.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t received interpretations
of dreams from Jehovah.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he is acting on faith

01:36:58.343 --> 01:37:00.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
—faith that he had learned

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
by studying the sacred books of his time.

01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:04.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
These books

01:37:04.266 --> 01:37:06.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely included the inspired writings

01:37:06.601 --> 01:37:11.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, and other prophets.

01:37:11.565 --> 01:37:13.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, we can only imagine

01:37:13.692 --> 01:37:16.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel poring over these scrolls,

01:37:17.446 --> 01:37:19.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
opening up his heart to Jehovah,

01:37:19.614 --> 01:37:22.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
begging Jehovah to give him wisdom and understanding.

01:37:22.075 --> 01:37:23.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved it.

01:37:23.785 --> 01:37:25.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt that

01:37:25.579 --> 01:37:27.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Daniel studied these accounts,

01:37:27.748 --> 01:37:30.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
his faith was strengthened

01:37:30.167 --> 01:37:33.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his bond with Jehovah drew even closer.

01:37:33.670 --> 01:37:37.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though Daniel knew nothing
of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream,

01:37:37.591 --> 01:37:39.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was fully convinced

01:37:39.885 --> 01:37:42.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would reveal the dream

01:37:42.054 --> 01:37:44.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its interpretation

01:37:44.139 --> 01:37:46.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prove to be Daniel’s salvation.

01:37:48.018 --> 01:37:49.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we know exactly which accounts

01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:52.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel was able to draw from at this time?

01:37:52.648 --> 01:37:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s impossible to say for a certainty,

01:37:55.317 --> 01:37:58.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know he had access to “the books.”

01:37:58.487 --> 01:38:01.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
He references the prophecies of Jeremiah.

01:38:01.365 --> 01:38:05.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel could see how Jehovah blessed
faithful, obedient men in the past.

01:38:05.953 --> 01:38:08.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by asking Nebuchadnezzar for time,

01:38:08.706 --> 01:38:10.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t looking to buy himself

01:38:10.624 --> 01:38:12.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
another day of life;

01:38:12.167 --> 01:38:14.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was allowing Jehovah to reward his faith

01:38:14.753 --> 01:38:16.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
by revealing the dream to him.

01:38:19.675 --> 01:38:22.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel strikes a balance here.

01:38:22.761 --> 01:38:24.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although he is confident

01:38:24.763 --> 01:38:27.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will reveal the dream to him,

01:38:27.766 --> 01:38:31.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
he isn’t casual in the way
he handled the situation.

01:38:31.854 --> 01:38:34.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did what any God-fearing man

01:38:34.899 --> 01:38:36.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
would do here.

01:38:36.484 --> 01:38:39.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approached Jehovah in prayer.

01:38:39.528 --> 01:38:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah,

01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:44.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
surely you didn’t bring us here just to die.

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will people say?

01:38:47.453 --> 01:38:48.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
We told them

01:38:48.663 --> 01:38:50.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are the God of the heavens,

01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:53.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
the only God who can reveal secrets.

01:38:55.252 --> 01:38:59.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, vindicate yourself.

01:39:39.339 --> 01:39:41.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have found a man from the exiles of Judah

01:39:41.382 --> 01:39:42.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can make known

01:39:42.884 --> 01:39:43.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
the interpretation to the king.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know who he is.

01:39:47.138 --> 01:39:48.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you really make known to me

01:39:48.765 --> 01:39:50.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
the dream that I saw

01:39:50.058 --> 01:39:51.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its interpretation?

01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:06.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a God in the heavens

01:40:06.032 --> 01:40:07.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is a Revealer of secrets,

01:40:09.911 --> 01:40:12.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar

01:40:12.497 --> 01:40:13.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is to happen

01:40:13.957 --> 01:40:16.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the final part of the days.

01:40:18.586 --> 01:40:21.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is your dream:

01:40:28.471 --> 01:40:30.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw an immense image.

01:40:39.065 --> 01:40:40.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
That image

01:40:40.609 --> 01:40:42.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
was standing in front of you.

01:40:45.363 --> 01:40:48.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
You yourself are the head of gold.

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:53.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after you another kingdom will rise,

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
inferior to you.

01:40:55.374 --> 01:41:00.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then another kingdom, a third one, of copper,

01:41:00.128 --> 01:41:03.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will rule over the whole earth.

01:41:03.256 --> 01:41:05.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the fourth kingdom,

01:41:05.634 --> 01:41:07.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will be strong like iron.

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
The kingdom will be divided.

01:41:12.474 --> 01:41:14.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the toes of the feet

01:41:14.601 --> 01:41:17.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

01:41:17.896 --> 01:41:21.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the kingdom will be partly strong

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and partly fragile.

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
This took a tremendous amount of faith

01:41:28.824 --> 01:41:31.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and courage on the part of Daniel.

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:34.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we may find our peace threatened,

01:41:34.246 --> 01:41:37.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
our very lives might be on the line.

01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:42.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that moment, we can turn
to Jehovah God in prayer,

01:41:42.046 --> 01:41:46.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
opening up our hearts,
confident that he will support us.

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:49.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like both Daniel and Jonah,

01:41:49.386 --> 01:41:51.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been given an assignment

01:41:51.013 --> 01:41:52.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
to proclaim a message.

01:41:53.015 --> 01:41:55.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
This requires courage to speak out boldly

01:41:55.684 --> 01:41:57.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
concerning Jehovah’s judgments

01:41:57.603 --> 01:42:00.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
against those who oppose his sovereignty.

01:42:00.606 --> 01:42:03.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of these prophets are excellent examples

01:42:03.359 --> 01:42:06.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah backing those who trust in him.

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:12.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always be with us
as long as we have faith in him.

01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:15.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face situations that seem impossible,

01:42:15.538 --> 01:42:17.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
as in the case with Hezekiah,

01:42:17.623 --> 01:42:19.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the ability to tap

01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:23.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the most powerful force there is!

01:42:23.838 --> 01:42:26.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this system comes to a close,

01:42:26.465 --> 01:42:29.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will find ourselves in situations

01:42:29.218 --> 01:42:32.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
that test our courage and threaten our peace.

01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:35.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will have to stand up
for pure worship

01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:39.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Josiah, and this will be unpopular.

01:42:39.562 --> 01:42:41.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah on our side,

01:42:41.856 --> 01:42:44.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can face those situations with confidence.

01:42:44.567 --> 01:42:45.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s all-powerful,

01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s going to help us through it.

01:42:48.237 --> 01:42:51.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the interesting thing:

01:42:51.282 --> 01:42:54.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the prophecies that Daniel recorded

01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:59.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
applied not only to the future
of the Babylonian Empire

01:42:59.207 --> 01:43:02.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also outline world events

01:43:02.627 --> 01:43:05.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our day and beyond.

01:43:05.713 --> 01:43:09.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these events are being fulfilled

01:43:09.592 --> 01:43:12.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
right before our very eyes!

01:43:20.603 --> 01:43:23.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a motivating presentation!

01:43:23.398 --> 01:43:25.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when our peace is threatened,

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:30.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can focus on how our integrity
relates to Jehovah’s purpose,

01:43:30.905 --> 01:43:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can endure with joy.

01:43:35.118 --> 01:43:39.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to watching Part 2
of this important consideration

01:43:39.372 --> 01:43:42.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the final session of our convention.

01:43:42.751 --> 01:43:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s sing together song number 130,

01:43:45.879 --> 01:43:48.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Be Forgiving.”

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 130.

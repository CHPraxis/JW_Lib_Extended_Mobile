WEBVTT

00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:05.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, we considered
the expression at Philippians 4:7,

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:09.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding,”

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, the tranquility and calmness

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy because we have
a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a remarkable blessing!

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
But although we enjoy God-given peace,

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
our life in this system of things
is not problem free, is it?

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 34:19 acknowledges
as much when it says:

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many are the hardships of the righteous one,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah rescues him from them all.”

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience family opposition,

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
persecution, war, natural disasters,

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
or severe illnesses,

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:52.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
but none of these hardships
can “separate us from God’s love.”

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Neither death nor life nor angels 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor governments
nor things now here nor things to come”

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
—none of these things
can rob us of the peace Jehovah gives.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, there is something that can.

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Isaiah 32:17.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read this text,

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice that it refers to peace as a result.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think of peace that way, as a result?

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
If peace is a result, what causes it?

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 32:17:

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The result

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of true righteousness will be peace, 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the fruitage of true righteousness

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be lasting tranquility and security.”

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful expression,
“lasting tranquility and security”!

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, from what does it result?

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
True righteousness.

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if righteousness
no longer mattered to us?

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if a person concluded:
‘It makes no difference

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘how I live or what sacrifices I make.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to suffer hardships either way.

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
I might as well do
whatever I please while I can’?

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong with that thinking?

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:18.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it show appreciation for peace

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that Jehovah
has done to make it possible?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace is a result.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
And behind every result is a cause.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we want peace,
we have to pursue righteousness.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
An unrighteous person
cannot be at peace with God.

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:40.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serious transgressions put a strain
on a person’s relationship with God.

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:42.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall King David’s words found

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 38:3.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sensing Jehovah’s disapproval, he wrote:

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no peace

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
within my bones because of my sin.”

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inevitably, the unrighteous person

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:03.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reap what he sows and lose his peace.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is righteousness,
and how do we pursue it?

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Righteousness is what we have or what we show

00:03:12.838 --> 00:03:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we do what is right
according to Jehovah’s standards.

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those standards
are not just rules we follow

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
but principles that guide the way
we deal with each other.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Universal Sovereign and Creator,

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God determines what is righteous.

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that what was represented

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:33.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
by “the tree of the knowledge
of good and bad” in the garden of Eden?

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:37.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of Jehovah’s command
to abstain from its fruit,

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
that tree represented God’s right
to determine for his creatures

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is good and what is bad for them.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although Jehovah
has given humans free will,

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right to choose,

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has not granted humans
(not even perfect ones)

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right to set the standard
for what is righteous and what is not.

00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice once again that Isaiah 32:17 says

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the result
of true righteousness will be peace.”

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
It uses that term twice—“true righteousness.”

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everything called righteousness
is true righteousness.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people view righteousness
as just a personal virtue

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:22.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
achieved by following the rules.

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 23:28,

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:28.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that the Pharisees
appeared righteous on the outside,

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:31.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
but inside they were lawless.

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:35.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 7:16 talks about those

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:39.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
who think their standards
are more righteous even than God’s.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at Romans 10:3,

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:44.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul talked about people
who ‘seek to establish

00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:47.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
their own righteousness.’

00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:49.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
But false piety,

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:52.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
over-righteousness, and self-righteousness

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not what Isaiah 32:17 is talking about.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:01.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, many argue for the acceptance

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:04.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
of conduct that Jehovah forbids.

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may even find support
from a world already alienated from God.

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:13.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
But wide acceptance in a growing community

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:15.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not redefine righteousness.

00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:19.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of that is true righteousness.

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Creator sets
the standard for what is right

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:26.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not our feelings,
not the community at large.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while you’re here in Isaiah,

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:31.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
please turn to chapter 48.

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to be viewed as righteous,

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:39.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to trust that Jehovah

00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:41.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
should set the standard of right and wrong.

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, we must prove
by our speech and actions

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we agree with Jehovah’s standards
and obey him.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that takes real courage
in a wicked world.

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we do that, we enjoy the result.

00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:58.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says at Isaiah chapter 48,

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:01.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 17, 18:

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:07.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Holy One of Israel:

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:13.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:16.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself

00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:20.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[or as the footnote says, teaching you
“for your own good”],

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:24.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:28.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If only you would pay attention
to my commandments!

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Then your peace
would become just like a river

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:38.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your righteousness
like the waves of the sea.’”

00:06:39.294 --> 00:06:43.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paying attention to Jehovah’s commandments
results in two things.

00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:45.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, our peace

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:48.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “become just like a river”

00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:52.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
—serene, abundant, ongoing.

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:56.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, our righteousness
will be “like the waves of the sea.”

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember your last trip to the beach?

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:02.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you stood there on the shore,

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:04.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps on a high hill overlooking the ocean

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
watching the waves
roll in one after the other

00:07:08.365 --> 00:07:10.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as they have for thousands of years,

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
could you feel a sense of constancy?

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says that our course

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:19.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
of doing what is right can be just like that.

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:22.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will guide us
in the path of righteousness.

00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:25.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will bless us with unending peace.

00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:29.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the process, we learn through experience

00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:32.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah’s wise and loving ways

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:35.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly benefit us personally.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we refuse to do that,

00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn what agitation
and discord truly mean.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
As verse 22 says:

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:47.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘There is no peace,’ says Jehovah,
‘for the wicked.’”

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not a heavy-handed threat to manipulate

00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
human behavior
as if Jehovah needed to do that.

00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:57.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a fact, a truth, a timeless principle.

00:07:57.706 --> 00:07:59.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is love.”

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
He teaches us for our own good.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:07.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the result if we pay attention is peace

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:11.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 48:17, 18.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these verses assure us
that imperfect humans

00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:19.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly can have a righteous standing with God.

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:22.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s explore that further.

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you recall the very first time

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:29.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “righteous” is used in the Bible?

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Genesis chapter 6.

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:35.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you likely recognize this
as the account about Noah.

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:39.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah lived in an extremely wicked world.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his lifetime, rebel angels
left their assignments in heaven,

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:45.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
materialized, married human women,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fathered hybrid offspring
who became violent giants.

00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:54.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did all of that wickedness
and violence affect Jehovah?

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:57.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to Genesis 6:6,

00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:00.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“his heart was saddened,”

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:03.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a remarkable thing to contemplate,
isn’t it?

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:05.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s feelings are affected

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:09.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
by our decisions because he cares for us.

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:13.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
That ancient world became so wicked

00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:16.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah decided it must be destroyed.

00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:20.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, right in the midst
of all this depravity,

00:09:20.122 --> 00:09:22.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah showed a different spirit.

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:27.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says at Genesis 6:8, 9:

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:34.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:09:34.302 --> 00:09:37.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the history of Noah.

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:41.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah was a righteous man.”

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:42.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is.

00:09:42.936 --> 00:09:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why was he described as righteous?

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He proved himself faultless

00:09:50.902 --> 00:09:53.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
among his contemporaries.”

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:55.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Noah was not like the rebel angels

00:09:55.615 --> 00:09:58.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
or their offspring
or like degraded human society.

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:02.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Noah walked with the true God.”

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:07.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus the second time
we find the word “righteous”

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:11.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
is at Genesis 7:1:

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:14.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that, Jehovah said to Noah:

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go into the ark,
you and all your household,

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:19.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because you are the one

00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:23.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have found to be righteous

00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:27.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
before me among this generation.’”

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:30.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Noah’s righteousness,

00:10:30.108 --> 00:10:33.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
he and his family survived the Flood

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:36.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worship Jehovah on a cleansed earth.

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:39.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after the waters subsided

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:42.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the family emerged from the ark,

00:10:42.287 --> 00:10:45.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
they witnessed a splendid sight,

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:47.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
one never before observed:

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:50.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
a serene, multicolored arch

00:10:50.962 --> 00:10:53.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the sky
—a rainbow—

00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:56.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reassuring indication

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:58.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
of peace with God,

00:10:58.803 --> 00:11:03.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace resulting from righteousness.

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:05.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And where does the word “righteous”

00:11:05.602 --> 00:11:08.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
appear next in the Bible?

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the account about Abraham

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:13.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
—notably in his famous conversation
with Jehovah

00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:15.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in Genesis chapter 18,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah promised Abraham
that if he found

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:20.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
as few as ten righteous people
in the city of Sodom,

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would not destroy that city.

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:26.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what was it that distinguished Abraham

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:30.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
as righteous in that moral climate?

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:33.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you read Genesis chapters 12 through 22,

00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:36.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get the sense that Abraham

00:11:36.216 --> 00:11:38.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a man of great faith, unwavering faith.

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was ready to do whatever
Jehovah asked of him.

00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:45.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, citing Genesis 15:6

00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:49.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other texts, James 2:23 says

00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:54.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and it was counted to him

00:11:56.528 --> 00:11:59.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as righteousness,’

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:03.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he came to be called Jehovah’s friend

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah’s friend,

00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:10.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“peace with God resulting

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
from righteousness].”

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:15.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about God’s people today?

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:19.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Isaiah chapter 60

00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:23.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah chapter 60.

00:12:23.054 --> 00:12:26.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah refers to Noah

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Abraham as “righteous.”

00:12:29.603 --> 00:12:33.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would he say about you and me?

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:36.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what it says
toward the end of this chapter.

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:38.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah chapter 60,

00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:42.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 21, 22:

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And all your people

00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:50.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be righteous;

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:54.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they will possess the land forever.

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:56.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are the sprout that I planted,

00:12:56.796 --> 00:13:00.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the work of my hands,
for me to be beautified.

00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:04.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The little one will become a thousand
and the small one a mighty nation.

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I myself, Jehovah,

00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:09.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
will speed it up in its own time.”

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:14.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, prospective members of the great crowd

00:13:14.022 --> 00:13:19.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been declared righteous
as friends of God as Abraham was.

00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:21.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jehovah’s eyes, they are, as it says

00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Revelation 7:9, “dressed in white robes.”

00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:30.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, they’re serving
alongside God’s spirit-anointed ones

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are declared righteous for life.

00:13:32.874 --> 00:13:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, [our] Repurchaser,

00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:39.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Holy One of Israel,” has bought us back

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
from bondage to sin and death

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:46.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:13:46.304 --> 00:13:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus with faith

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ,

00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:56.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfect people are considered righteous
in the sight of God.

00:13:56.398 --> 00:14:00.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in calling us righteous,
Jehovah God by means of Jesus

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
has done something for us
that we could not do

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:04.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ourselves in our imperfect condition.

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:08.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does that mean that we can do no wrong?

00:14:09.452 --> 00:14:12.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it does not mean that.

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:16.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to maintain our peace,

00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:20.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must cooperate with Jehovah.

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:24.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Romans chapter 1.

00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:28.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, like Noah and Abraham,

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:30.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
we live in a wicked and violent world

00:14:30.098 --> 00:14:33.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we are exposed
to a spirit of disobedience.

00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:35.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan wants us to become part of this world

00:14:35.937 --> 00:14:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
by adopting its unrighteous standards.

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:44.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world, sexual immorality
is practiced without shame.

00:14:44.028 --> 00:14:46.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Homosexuals flaunt their conduct.

00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:48.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah tells us

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
that homosexual acts are unrighteous.

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:56.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
God specifically warned the Israelites

00:14:56.499 --> 00:14:59.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
against this and other forms of immorality.

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leviticus 18:22 says

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:07.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
that homosexual acts are “detestable.”

00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:11.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah still find it so offensive?

00:15:11.765 --> 00:15:15.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what he inspired
for both Jews and non-Jews

00:15:15.727 --> 00:15:17.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Christian Greek Scriptures here

00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:22.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 1:26, 27:

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:26.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why God gave them over

00:15:26.654 --> 00:15:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to disgraceful sexual passion,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for their females changed the natural use

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:35.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of themselves into one contrary to nature;

00:15:35.955 --> 00:15:40.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“likewise also the males left
the natural use of the female

00:15:40.043 --> 00:15:43.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and became violently inflamed
in their lust toward one another,

00:15:43.797 --> 00:15:47.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“males with males, working what is obscene

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and receiving
in themselves the full penalty,

00:15:50.345 --> 00:15:53.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was due for their error.”

00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:57.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah has not changed.

00:15:57.268 --> 00:16:00.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Creator, homosexual acts

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
constitute disgraceful,

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:05.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
obscene error.

00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some would disagree.

00:16:08.738 --> 00:16:10.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
As verse 28 points out,

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:15.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
such ones do not consider it
worthwhile “to acknowledge God.”

00:16:15.453 --> 00:16:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with what result?

00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:22.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it says there,
“a disapproved mental state”

00:16:22.168 --> 00:16:24.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just the opposite of peace.

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:29.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
And merely approving
of unrighteous conduct displeases Jehovah.

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:33.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how this is indicated in verse 32:

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:37.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although these know full well
the righteous decree of God

00:16:37.684 --> 00:16:41.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—that those practicing such things
are deserving of death—

00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:43.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they not only keep on doing them

00:16:43.648 --> 00:16:48.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also approve of those practicing them.”

00:16:49.445 --> 00:16:52.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, we do not hate individuals

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:55.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
who practice unrighteousness,
nor do we judge them.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the contrary,
we share the good news with them.

00:16:57.954 --> 00:17:01.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember that we were all born
with the same infirmities

00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:03.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have the same sinful tendencies.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also have
the same inherent spiritual need.

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:11.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thus, we recognize that others
can have the same peace,

00:17:11.384 --> 00:17:15.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same privileges,
and the same prospects we enjoy

00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:19.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they pay attention to Jehovah.

00:17:19.142 --> 00:17:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 2:3, 4 says
that God’s “will is that all sorts of people

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be saved
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
And people practicing
all manner of unrighteousness

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:31.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
have accepted the truth.

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is what some of you were,”
1 Corinthians 6:11 says.

00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we communicate impartially
with all our neighbors.

00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:42.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we hate unrighteous conduct,

00:17:42.332 --> 00:17:46.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we refuse to compromise Bible principles.

00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:49.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes moral issues

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
become the center
of heated political debates.

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:55.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
We avoid getting drawn
into such controversies.

00:17:55.136 --> 00:18:00.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, in practical terms,
what might that look like?

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video, notice how adults

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:08.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
can respond effectively when questioned
on highly controversial issues.

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:21.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:18:22.455 --> 00:18:24.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you both get the email survey I sent?

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:26.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re both coming, right?

00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:28.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
I must have missed it.
I was on calls all morning.

00:18:28.586 --> 00:18:29.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s this about?

00:18:29.796 --> 00:18:31.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the whole office is leaving early.

00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:34.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going downtown
to support the march

00:18:34.884 --> 00:18:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
for gay rights.

00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:39.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
She won’t go.

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:40.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s against her religion.

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:44.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of her people came by my house,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I asked, they said your church

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:49.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t support gay marriage.

00:18:50.316 --> 00:18:51.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irene?

00:18:54.862 --> 00:18:56.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true.

00:18:56.072 --> 00:19:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we hold to the Bible’s standard on marriage,

00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:03.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is only between a man and woman.

00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:06.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remain politically neutral.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s such ignorant thinking.

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:13.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand it’s a sensitive subject.

00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:17.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a daughter who deserves her rights!

00:19:17.218 --> 00:19:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust me, Amber,
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:19:21.764 --> 00:19:25.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
we believe everyone has a right
to choose how they live.

00:19:25.184 --> 00:19:28.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I would never force my beliefs on anyone.

00:19:28.396 --> 00:19:30.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you won’t go.

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as I would never force
my beliefs on you,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
all I ask is the same respect.

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:38.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, no, I won’t be going.

00:19:38.448 --> 00:19:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have to go back to work.

00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:48.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, obviously, Irene,

00:19:48.124 --> 00:19:50.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t agree with your perspective.

00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:54.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I do appreciate
that you not push it on anyone else.

00:19:54.297 --> 00:19:55.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:07.643 --> 00:20:11.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast with the majority of mankind
who are divided,

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:13.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
true Christians are united.

00:20:13.983 --> 00:20:17.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
We loyally support Jehovah’s right to rule.

00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t set the standards,

00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:21.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re not trying
to solve the world’s problems on our own.

00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:24.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
We fully support God’s Kingdom.

00:20:24.243 --> 00:20:26.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we observed in the video,

00:20:26.245 --> 00:20:29.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
moral and political issues
might be brought up in the workplace.

00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:34.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more often our young ones,
even very young ones,

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:36.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
are confronted with these same topics.

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:38.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will they respond?

00:20:38.674 --> 00:20:41.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are your young ones ready?

00:20:41.177 --> 00:20:43.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the next video,

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:47.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how Olivia defends
Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great discussion today, everyone.

00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:53.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, midterms are this Friday.

00:20:53.731 --> 00:20:55.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
No excuses!

00:20:55.566 --> 00:20:57.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes you, Jordan.

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were noticeably silent
during our discussion today, Olivia.

00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:04.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was?

00:21:04.075 --> 00:21:06.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I just didn’t have much to say.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aren’t you concerned about gay rights?

00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:11.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um,

00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:14.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, it seems like a political issue,

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I stay neutral
when it comes to political stuff.

00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:20.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not a political issue.

00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:22.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a human rights issue.

00:21:22.635 --> 00:21:24.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Dallas,

00:21:24.428 --> 00:21:25.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s like crazy religious.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:21:26.514 --> 00:21:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:28.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you don’t understand.

00:21:28.933 --> 00:21:31.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
hate everybody that isn’t straight.

00:21:31.435 --> 00:21:33.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not true! 
We don’t hate anyone.

00:21:33.688 --> 00:21:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve spoken with your people before.

00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:38.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seem big on equality.

00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:39.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are.

00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:41.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that ‘God isn’t partial.’

00:21:41.737 --> 00:21:44.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we believe that everyone
should be treated fairly.

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:48.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:21:48.077 --> 00:21:51.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I assume you have
gay members in your church.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we don’t.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought you just said
everyone should be treated equally?

00:22:01.465 --> 00:22:03.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m confused.

00:22:03.467 --> 00:22:04.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hah, called it!

00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jordan, don’t you have a class to get to?

00:22:08.848 --> 00:22:10.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was saying,

00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:14.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
how is that not a little hypocritical,

00:22:14.854 --> 00:22:18.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that you love everyone
and then excluding certain people?

00:22:26.365 --> 00:22:28.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, Mr. Dallas,

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:33.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve wondered the same thing.

00:22:33.831 --> 00:22:35.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
And?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I researched it in the Bible,
and I realized

00:22:41.088 --> 00:22:45.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God accepts all people,
but he doesn’t accept all conduct.

00:22:47.595 --> 00:22:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:22:50.973 --> 00:22:54.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that you can’t be abusing drugs

00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:56.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can’t be stealing

00:22:56.979 --> 00:23:00.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be violent and still be a Witness.

00:23:01.817 --> 00:23:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are just certain actions
that God just doesn’t accept.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Including how someone expresses
their sexuality?

00:23:13.996 --> 00:23:15.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases, yes.

00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:17.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
We follow God’s standards

00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:20.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not having sex without being married.

00:23:21.045 --> 00:23:22.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:23:23.714 --> 00:23:26.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
if that’s how you feel, that’s your right.

00:23:26.717 --> 00:23:30.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, it seems a tad archaic to me 

00:23:30.638 --> 00:23:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to each their own.

00:23:39.855 --> 00:23:40.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:23:40.856 --> 00:23:41.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:44.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the Bible really say all that?

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:47.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it does.

00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:48.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK,

00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:50.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe you can show me sometime.

00:23:50.324 --> 00:23:51.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.

00:23:51.742 --> 00:23:52.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Awesome.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can expect future installments
in this saga.

00:24:21.564 --> 00:24:23.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you notice how Olivia

00:24:23.983 --> 00:24:27.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
was able to defend
Jehovah’s righteous standards?

00:24:27.278 --> 00:24:30.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
She kept her peaceful spirit, didn’t she?

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:32.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
She acknowledged that she had
the same question as the teacher,

00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:35.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she had done further
research on the subject.

00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:39.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you appreciate how she
subtly showed that Jehovah’s standards

00:24:39.457 --> 00:24:42.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit both the individual
and the community?

00:24:42.918 --> 00:24:46.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
As examples, she highlighted
the avoidance of drug abuse and theft,

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:49.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
values she knew her teacher would appreciate.

00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:53.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, are your young ones

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:56.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
able to explain why we do

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
or don’t do certain things?

00:24:58.642 --> 00:25:00.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know how your children

00:25:00.853 --> 00:25:03.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
really feel about Jehovah’s standards?

00:25:03.564 --> 00:25:07.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they obedient simply
to avoid making you mad?

00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:12.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, will that truly be enough?

00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:14.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Encourage your young ones

00:25:14.992 --> 00:25:19.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prove to themselves
why Jehovah’s standards are wise.

00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:21.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help them to see how they can explain

00:25:21.582 --> 00:25:24.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
their choice to live by Jehovah’s standards.

00:25:24.126 --> 00:25:29.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teach them how to resist pressure
to follow the world.

00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:33.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so thankful

00:25:33.761 --> 00:25:38.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even during these
“critical times hard to deal with”

00:25:38.057 --> 00:25:42.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can enjoy the inner peace
that Jehovah gives to the righteous.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s remind ourselves of what Jehovah
promises to bring about

00:25:47.108 --> 00:25:50.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
once Satan’s unrighteous system is removed.

00:25:50.986 --> 00:25:54.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to Psalm 37.

00:25:56.075 --> 00:25:58.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in these familiar verses,

00:25:58.327 --> 00:26:01.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find a beautiful description
of what is to come.

00:26:01.997 --> 00:26:04.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice once again

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:06.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the Bible makes the correlation

00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:09.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
between peace and righteousness

00:26:09.922 --> 00:26:12.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 37:29.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have it?

00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:16.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:20.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who will possess the earth?

00:26:20.599 --> 00:26:22.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous.”

00:26:22.226 --> 00:26:25.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for how long will they live on it?

00:26:25.271 --> 00:26:27.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forever.”

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then according to verse 11,
what will they find there?

00:26:33.612 --> 00:26:35.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace.”

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:39.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result of true righteousness
will be peace.

00:26:39.118 --> 00:26:41.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how much peace will they find?

00:26:41.203 --> 00:26:44.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little peace?
just personal or family peace?

00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:46.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the righteous
already had peace with God,

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when wicked people still existed.

00:26:48.377 --> 00:26:52.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what will Jehovah provide
to all those who continue loving him?

00:26:53.674 --> 00:26:56.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
The abundance of peace.

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:59.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how will you feel about that?

00:26:59.847 --> 00:27:04.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Delighted or exquisitely delighted?

00:27:04.518 --> 00:27:06.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stick with it, dear friends.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this convention, be on the lookout
for the connection

00:27:09.523 --> 00:27:11.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
between peace and righteousness.

00:27:11.984 --> 00:27:14.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue on the course of righteousness.

00:27:14.153 --> 00:27:16.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help others to find “the way of peace.”

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:19.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, we can enjoy peace
with Jehovah now,

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:22.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the remainder of these last days,

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:26.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on into the future when Jesus
rules as King over a cleansed earth

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which “the righteous will flourish
and peace will abound.”

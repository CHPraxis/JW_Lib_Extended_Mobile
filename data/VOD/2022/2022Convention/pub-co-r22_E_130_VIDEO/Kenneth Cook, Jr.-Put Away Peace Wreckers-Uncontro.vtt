00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is the main peace wrecker.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:08.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures tell us
that he is driven by “great anger.”

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
His anger is malicious and uncontrolled.

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:15.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would any sound-minded,
God-fearing person

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:18.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
allow himself
to reflect Satan’s vicious anger?

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:20.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:23.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why all true servants of God
are determined

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:27.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “put away” uncontrolled anger.

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:31.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
But apart from uncontrolled anger,
is all anger bad?

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:35.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible does not condemn all anger.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
It teaches us that anger is wrong
when it is uncontrolled or unjustified.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:44.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 4:26, God’s Word tells us:

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:47.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be wrathful, but [it adds] do not sin.”

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:50.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, anger
may simply be a strong feeling

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:54.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes into us
because of being upset or annoyed

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:57.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
by something that we see as being wrong.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
That in itself is not bad.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what makes anger bad
is when it fills a person’s heart

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he or she just loses control of it.

00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:10.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that happens,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may cause a person
to act without a sound mind.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:20.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who continue to lash out in anger
will not gain salvation.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:23.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 5:20 lists “fits of anger”

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:26.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
among “the works of the flesh”
that will prevent a person

00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:29.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
from inheriting God’s Kingdom.

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:33.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no place
for such ones in God’s new world.

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:36.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brief review of how uncontrolled anger

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrecks peace for ourselves and others

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:41.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
will highlight why this is so.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:43.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uncontrolled anger

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:47.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
harms both the angry person
as well as those around him.

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:50.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read at Proverbs 29:22

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
that an angry person “stirs up strife,”

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
adding that he “commits many transgressions.”

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of these many sins is abusive speech.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must work to show restraint
when speaking with workmates,

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:08.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
with strangers in the ministry,

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:11.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers and sisters
in the congregation,

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with our family members.

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:17.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad feelings must be controlled.

00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:20.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abusive speech, ridicule, contempt,

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:23.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hateful anger are wrong.

00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:27.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Giving vent to such feelings
can destroy precious friendships

00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:31.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
with other people and with Jehovah.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be like a volcano
that will not quiet down.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like an erupting volcano
will harm those living around it,

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:43.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
so too a person who expresses intense anger

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:46.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
will harm those living around him.

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:49.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also damages himself.

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:56.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acting on anger often leads
to even more aggression,

00:02:56.002 --> 00:03:00.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
so uncontrolled anger
can also affect our own peace.

00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:03.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can cause us to do something
that we will later regret.

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:06.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can have a negative effect on our health.

00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:10.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Medical studies show that uncontrolled anger

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:14.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
can cause high blood pressure
and respiratory problems.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can also affect the liver and pancreas,

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such anger can cause digestive problems.

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:23.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a person becomes angry,

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:25.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she will not always think clearly.

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:30.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a fit of rage,
a person may become depressed.

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:34.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder we read at Proverbs 14:30

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “a calm heart gives life to the body.”

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:43.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disastrous consequences
of uncontrolled anger

00:03:43.136 --> 00:03:45.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
are illustrated in God’s Word

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the actions of Simeon and Levi,

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:51.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
sons of the patriarch Jacob.

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they learned that their sister, Dinah,

00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:56.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
was violated by a man named Shechem,

00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:59.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read at Genesis 34:7

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:03.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “they were offended and very angry.”

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:06.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they had a valid reason to be angry,

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they took their anger too far.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was uncontrolled.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simeon and Levi
took vengeance on Shechem.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using deception, they attacked and killed

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
every male in Shechem’s city.

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, along with the other sons of Jacob,

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:28.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
they plundered it and took
the women and little children captive.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:33.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dinah’s tragic experience
must have grieved Jacob greatly.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:38.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he condemned
his sons’ uncontrolled anger.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simeon and Levi
tried to justify their actions,

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that was not the end of the matter,

00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:47.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah was also displeased.

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:50.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason, Jacob later foretold

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the descendants of Simeon and Levi

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:57.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
were to be scattered
among the tribes of Israel.

00:04:57.674 --> 00:05:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their uncontrolled anger brought disfavor

00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:04.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
from God and from their father, Jacob.

00:05:04.974 --> 00:05:08.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re wise to pay attention
to such Scriptural accounts

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put away uncontrolled anger
and all of the harm that it brings.

00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:16.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:21.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a person
might be tempted to give in to anger.

00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:31.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Nana?

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t forget eggs, dear.

00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:33.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, I didn’t forget.

00:05:33.797 --> 00:05:34.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you sure, love?

00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:36.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I won’t forget. OK.

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:36.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:37.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Love you.

00:05:37.634 --> 00:05:38.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:05:47.645 --> 00:05:48.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, finally, I’ve caught you.

00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:57.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have a minute?

00:05:57.114 --> 00:05:58.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Emily.

00:05:58.073 --> 00:05:58.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we talk later?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really struggling this morning.

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:05.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, it’s just that you’ve been so busy,
and I’ve been waiting for the right moment;

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:07.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d really just like to address it.

00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:11.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. What’s up?

00:06:11.713 --> 00:06:15.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just that I’ve noticed
your posts lately on QuicPost.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about them?

00:06:17.928 --> 00:06:22.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do you really think they’re something
that a pioneer should be posting?

00:06:22.474 --> 00:06:25.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
What? What are you talking about?

00:06:25.102 --> 00:06:27.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think you’re bragging.

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:30.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people? What people?

00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:32.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a business account.
I’ve got to show off my products.

00:06:32.443 --> 00:06:33.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know. I get that.

00:06:33.152 --> 00:06:34.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just—
I don’t know.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could feel like you’re drawing
a little too much attention to yourself.

00:06:37.157 --> 00:06:39.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would think like that? You?

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:42.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not just me; Celia felt the same.

00:06:42.746 --> 00:06:44.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
You spoke to Celia about this?

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:47.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to upset you.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake said that I needed to take . . .

00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:52.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake! So everyone thinks
my posts are inappropriate?

00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:54.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone, Haley.

00:06:54.384 --> 00:06:56.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:06:56.928 --> 00:06:58.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:06:58.763 --> 00:07:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! I can’t believe you.

00:07:00.432 --> 00:07:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who else have you spoken to?

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are just such a gossip!

00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:05.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not gossiping. I was trying to . . .

00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:05.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are!

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just trying to help you,
if you would just listen to me.

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:10.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so jealous!

00:07:10.192 --> 00:07:10.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d just listen to me.

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, listen to this.

00:07:14.697 --> 00:07:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I expected more from you.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:07:19.494 --> 00:07:22.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossiping about my posts!

00:07:22.873 --> 00:07:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:07:30.214 --> 00:07:31.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley,

00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:37.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
wait, please!

00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you left feeling a bit tense?

00:07:48.358 --> 00:07:53.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you know
what uncontrolled anger can lead to.

00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:57.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we’ve defined uncontrolled anger

00:07:57.493 --> 00:08:00.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and considered what it can lead to,

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next question is,

00:08:02.207 --> 00:08:06.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we put away uncontrolled anger?

00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:11.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we need to recognize
the danger of uncontrolled anger.

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 25:28 states

00:08:13.844 --> 00:08:17.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “as a city broken through,
without a wall,

00:08:17.348 --> 00:08:21.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the man who cannot control his temper.”

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:25.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strong city walls
were vital in ancient times.

00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:28.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without them a city
would quickly fall to invaders;

00:08:28.443 --> 00:08:32.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
likewise, so will those
who cannot control their temper.

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:36.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
By losing control, they
make themselves vulnerable

00:08:36.577 --> 00:08:39.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the invasion of wrong thoughts

00:08:39.622 --> 00:08:43.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
—thoughts that can cause them
to hurt themselves and others.

00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uncontrolled anger can do just that.

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:51.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, after recognizing the danger,

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:54.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must pause and then deal with the anger

00:08:54.555 --> 00:08:58.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it causes us
to do something that we will regret.

00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:00.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
When anger grows within us,

00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:04.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re wise to recall
what happened with Simeon and Levi.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might also recall what happened

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:10.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the video dramatization
that we just viewed.

00:09:10.322 --> 00:09:12.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, in each case,

00:09:12.532 --> 00:09:15.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
pausing before reacting out of anger

00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:18.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have spared
much pain and heartache, true?

00:09:18.873 --> 00:09:20.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we have this warning

00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:24.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 17:14:

00:09:24.003 --> 00:09:28.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before the quarrel breaks out,
take your leave.”

00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind,
each of us should ask himself:

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:34.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do I tend to jump to conclusions

00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:36.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when I don’t have all the facts?

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If so, can I take my leave
and put away anger

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it starts to build up?’

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspired advice

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:49.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at James 1:19 will help us to do so

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:53.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but only if we make
a sincere and determined effort

00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:56.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply what it says.

00:09:56.288 --> 00:10:01.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that verse—James 1:19.

00:10:01.293 --> 00:10:03.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we find some simple steps

00:10:03.754 --> 00:10:07.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us put away uncontrolled anger.

00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:10.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Know this, my beloved brothers:

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:13.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everyone must be quick to listen,

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:17.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
slow to speak, slow to anger.”

00:10:18.437 --> 00:10:21.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we ask Jehovah to help us with this,

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
namely to “be quick to listen,

00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:27.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
slow to speak, slow to anger,”

00:10:27.155 --> 00:10:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will assist us to do so.

00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:32.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help us
to see the facts of the matter,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
show understanding,
and then put away uncontrolled anger.

00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:39.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
A word of caution, though:

00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:42.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
To succeed in doing our part,

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:46.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must choose our associates wisely.

00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:49.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could undermine all of our good work

00:10:49.554 --> 00:10:53.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s help in controlling our anger

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:56.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we choose associates who are arrogant,

00:10:56.353 --> 00:11:01.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
opinionated, or quick to become angry.

00:11:01.358 --> 00:11:04.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding someone who is disposed to rage,

00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:08.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 22:25 warns:

00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:11.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never learn his ways.”

00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:14.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve enjoyed
another outstanding series of talks

00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:16.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
that should help us to keep awake,

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
maintain fine conduct,

00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:23.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
and escape the judgment
that will soon come on this world.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this symposium has emphasized,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must do our utmost
to continue to put away peace wreckers

00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:33.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as inappropriate boasting, envy,

00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
dishonesty, harmful gossip,

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:39.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and uncontrolled anger.

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:42.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have a problem
with any of the peacemaking qualities

00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:45.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have discussed in this symposium,

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
seek Jehovah’s help
to change and then work at it.

00:11:50.036 --> 00:11:52.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sincere efforts to pursue peace

00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:55.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers and our sisters

00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:59.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
will influence how earnestly
we are awaiting “Jehovah’s day”

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:02.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his promised new world.

00:12:02.257 --> 00:12:06.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our genuine efforts
will affect our hearts

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will be noticed by our heavenly Father.

00:12:09.348 --> 00:12:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in his great mercy,

00:12:12.602 --> 00:12:16.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will consider us
to be, as his Word says,

00:12:16.522 --> 00:12:20.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“spotless and unblemished and in peace”

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:24.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both with him
and with our fellow worshippers.

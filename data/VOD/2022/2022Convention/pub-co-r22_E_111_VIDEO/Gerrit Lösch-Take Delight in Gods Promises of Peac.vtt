00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:04.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful and impressive

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
to realize that Jehovah promises

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:12.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
to raise people from the dead
and to end death permanently!

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to read with me
that comforting promise

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in Isaiah chapter 25.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding our God, Jehovah,

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 25:7, 8 says:

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will do away with the shroud

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is enveloping all the peoples

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the covering that is woven

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“over all the nations.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will swallow up death forever,

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
will wipe away the tears from all faces.”

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>
of September 15, 2014,

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 25, said:

00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fittingly, the Bible refers
to inherited sin and death

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as ‘the shroud
that is enveloping all the peoples

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:10.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the covering
that is woven over all the nations.’

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This suffocating covering, or shroud,

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this intricate webwork of condemnation,

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
entraps all people.”

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do we know that Jehovah
can resurrect the dead?

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he already brought his people
back to life figuratively in the past.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 537 before our Common Era,
Jehovah, in effect,

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
raised the nation of Israel from the dead,

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
restoring the people who were held captive

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Babylon for 70 years to their homeland

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reestablishing pure worship.

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:57.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1919,
Jehovah freed his modern-day people

00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:02.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Babylon the Great,
the world empire of false religion,

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:07.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
revitalizing them for renewed activity.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 26:19 prophesied this:

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your dead will live.

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My corpses will rise up.

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Awake and shout joyfully,

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you residents in the dust!

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For your dew is as the dew

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the morning, and the earth will let those

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
powerless in death come to life.”

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
When were God’s people held captive
by Babylon the Great?

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
That spiritual captivity lasted
from the second century

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Common Era to 1919,

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
when anointed Christians were gathered

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the restored congregation.

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people were tested and refined

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the years following the establishment

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s Kingdom in the heavens in 1914.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in 1919, Jesus appointed

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:10.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
over God’s cleansed people
to give them spiritual

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“food at the proper time.”

00:03:12.337 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the year that God’s people
started to return

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:20.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their God-given spiritual estate.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was also the time when they

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:27.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
were released from symbolic captivity
to Babylon the Great.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
How happy we can be, though,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
that after God’s people experienced
centuries of spiritual oppression,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
we as God’s people
not only experience a spiritual restoration

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a spiritual paradise
but also will see the fulfillment

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:46.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Isaiah 25:8

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:50.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
when God “[swallows] up death forever”!

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah will end death forever.

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:59.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a thrilling promise of peace!

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:03.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us have not lost a loved one
to some disease,

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even from COVID-19

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an accident or a disaster?

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:13.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
God here promises
that death will be no more,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
which suggests that the children who

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be born then will not have to face

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prospect of growing up and then
getting old, ending in death.

00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:27.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to Isaiah’s prophecy,

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:32.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 21:4 clearly states
a similar thought.

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:37.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read that “death will be no more.”

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:43.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what Jehovah has already done

00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:48.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show his love for us
and what he will do for us in the future.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:55.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
He restored that ruined nation

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if bringing it back to life.

00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:08.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1919,

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:11.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did something similar.

00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:16.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
He released his modern-day people
from spiritual captivity

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and energized them to preach.

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:32.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Jehovah raised his people
from figurative death,

00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:37.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
so will he reverse
the effects of literal death.

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, God “will swallow up death forever.”

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine living longer than any tree

00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:37.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
because “death will be no more.”

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:47.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we delight in the many things
Jehovah gives us!

00:06:47.844 --> 00:06:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we are privileged
to be among the only group of people

00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:57.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
who worship Jehovah
in the elevated way that he approves,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
as prophesied in Isaiah 2:2.

00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:05.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about the overwhelming joy

00:07:05.487 --> 00:07:09.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will feel when Jehovah
resurrects our loved ones!

00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:16.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank Jehovah
for our precious resurrection hope.

00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:20.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 4:13 says:

00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:23.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, brothers,

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we do not want you to be ignorant

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:27.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about those who are sleeping in death,

00:07:27.884 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may not sorrow

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:33.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the rest do who have no hope.”

00:07:34.307 --> 00:07:39.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on it to strengthen
your faith and courage.

00:07:39.312 --> 00:07:42.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it important for us to do so?

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:47.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the threat of death
is a powerful weapon.

00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:51.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those under Satan’s control
use it to force people to betray

00:07:51.574 --> 00:07:55.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
their friends
or to give up their convictions.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that threat is powerless against us.

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that if our enemies kill us,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will restore us to life.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:09.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are convinced that nothing

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
they can do can sever

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:15.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
our attachment to Jehovah.

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:19.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
What remarkable wisdom
Jehovah has shown

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving us the resurrection hope!

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of it, he disarms Satan

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
of one of his most effective weapons

00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:30.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at the same time arms us

00:08:30.613 --> 00:08:33.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
with unbreakable courage.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:38.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that death is temporary
and that the life Jehovah

00:08:38.413 --> 00:08:42.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
offers each of us will last forever.

00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:46.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium,

00:08:46.713 --> 00:08:51.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have learned how Jehovah
fulfilled his promises in the past,

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:54.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he is fulfilling them today,

00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:57.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he will fulfill them in the future.

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:02.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have seen,
God’s promises of peace include:

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) nutritious spiritual
and physical food for all,

00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:13.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) adequate housing and satisfying work,

00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) freedom from the risk of violence,

00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
(4) perfect physical health,

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:28.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (5) the elimination of death.

00:09:29.964 --> 00:09:33.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah as our God and best Friend,

00:09:33.384 --> 00:09:38.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will ‘delight
in the abundance of peace forever.’

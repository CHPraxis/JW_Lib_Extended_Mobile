00:00:01 Some individuals search for years
00:00:04 before finding Kingdom truth.
00:00:07 Consider Mary Kennedy.
00:00:10 She came to the United States from Scotland
00:00:14 in the early 1900’s at the age of 18
00:00:17 and found work as a housekeeper.
00:00:19 She dreamed of becoming a missionary.
00:00:23 She found flaws in religion.
00:00:26 Still wanting to help others,
00:00:29 Mary began training in the medical field.
00:00:34 And in 1910, she graduated
00:00:36 from the Boston City Hospital Training School for Nurses.
00:00:40 She continued to search for truth
00:00:44 but was disappointed by false doctrines
00:00:48 and the hypocrisy she found in many churches.
00:00:51 She kept reading her Bible
00:00:54 even though she thought she was finished with religion.
00:00:58 While working at the Pottenger’s Sanatorium in California,
00:01:02 she found
00:01:03 what she’d been looking for.
00:01:05 She came in contact
00:01:07 with a nurse and Bible Student
00:01:09 named Nellie Hanford.
00:01:11 One day,
00:01:12 Nellie shared with her
00:01:14 what the Bible says
00:01:16 about the condition of the dead.
00:01:18 Mary said that it was like
00:01:20 a telephone switchboard in her mind,
00:01:23 with one light after another turning on.
00:01:26 Instantly she knew she’d found the truth.
00:01:30 She abandoned all her ambitions in medicine
00:01:33 and began a lifelong career
00:01:35 as a full-time minister of the Bible.
00:01:39 Some, like Mary,
00:01:42 actively search for the truth.
00:01:45 Others find it even though they weren’t looking for it.
00:01:51 My life revolved around volleyball at the highest national level.
00:01:56 Training every day, traveling regularly,
00:01:58 and playing matches
00:01:59 meant that everything else
00:02:00 had to take second place.
00:02:05 I wasn’t really searching for the truth,
00:02:07 but my girlfriend started studying the Bible.
00:02:09 I thought, ‘I’d really like to know more about this.’
00:02:13 I discovered that it’s just like a jigsaw puzzle,
00:02:15 where all the pieces fit neatly into place.
00:02:18 Daniel chapter 2 in particular intrigued me,
00:02:21 and I realized that it was important to do more with what I was learning.
00:02:26 So I had to decide between a temporary life in this world
00:02:29 or eternal life under God’s Kingdom.
00:02:33 I needed to make changes in how I spent my time and in my priorities.
00:02:37 I was quite self-centered.
00:02:40 Right when I decided to stop,
00:02:42 I got a lucrative offer to play with the defending champions for a year.
00:02:45 I could finally achieve all the things
00:02:48 I had been working hard for all those years:
00:02:50 recognition and a good income.
00:02:52 But I still decided to refuse their offer.
00:02:56 Before I came into the truth,
00:02:58 I thought I knew how to achieve success.
00:03:01 But Jehovah knows the best way to succeed in life.
00:03:04 I’m very glad that I’m now able to spend my time helping others,
00:03:07 and that’s what brings true happiness.
00:03:09 And now my wife and I serve Jehovah full-time,
00:03:13 which is the best way you can use your life.
00:03:17 Jehovah drew both Mary and Björn to the truth.
00:03:21 Both of them
00:03:22 focused on the value, not the cost,
00:03:25 of Kingdom truth.

Some individuals search for years

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:07.152 line:10% position:50% align:center
before finding Kingdom truth.

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:10.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
Consider Mary Kennedy.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
She came to the United States from Scotland

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:17.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the early 1900’s at the age of 18

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found work as a housekeeper.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:23.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
She dreamed of becoming a missionary.

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:26.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
She found flaws in religion.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still wanting to help others,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary began training in the medical field.

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 1910, she graduated

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:40.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Boston City Hospital
Training School for Nurses.

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
She continued to search for truth

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:48.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
but was disappointed by false doctrines

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the hypocrisy she found in many churches.

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
She kept reading her Bible

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though she thought
she was finished with religion.

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
While working
at the Pottenger’s Sanatorium in California,

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
she found

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
what she’d been looking for.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:07.171 line:10% position:50% align:center
She came in contact

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a nurse and Bible Student

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:11.634 line:10% position:50% align:center
named Nellie Hanford.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:12.968 line:10% position:50% align:center
One day,

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nellie shared with her

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the Bible says

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the condition of the dead.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary said that it was like

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
a telephone switchboard in her mind,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
with one light after another turning on.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instantly she knew she’d found the truth.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
She abandoned all her ambitions in medicine

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began a lifelong career

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a full-time minister of the Bible.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some, like Mary,

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
actively search for the truth.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others find it
even though they weren’t looking for it.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life revolved around volleyball
at the highest national level.

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:58.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Training every day, traveling regularly,

00:01:58.806 --> 00:01:59.932 line:10% position:50% align:center
and playing matches

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:00.933 line:10% position:50% align:center
meant that everything else

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
had to take second place.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t really searching for the truth,

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my girlfriend started studying the Bible.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘I’d really like to know more about this.’

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
I discovered
that it’s just like a jigsaw puzzle,

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:17.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
where all the pieces fit neatly into place.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel chapter 2 in particular intrigued me,

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I realized that it was important
to do more with what I was learning.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had to decide
between a temporary life in this world

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
or eternal life under God’s Kingdom.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:36.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed to make changes
in how I spent my time and in my priorities.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was quite self-centered.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right when I decided to stop,

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got a lucrative offer to play
with the defending champions for a year.

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could finally achieve all the things

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had been working hard for all those years:

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognition and a good income.

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I still decided to refuse their offer.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I came into the truth,

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I knew how to achieve success.

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah knows
the best way to succeed in life.

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very glad that I’m now able
to spend my time helping others,

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s what brings true happiness.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now my wife and I
serve Jehovah full-time,

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the best way you can use your life.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:21.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah drew both Mary and Björn
to the truth.

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:22.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of them

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:25.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
focused on the value, not the cost,

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Kingdom truth.

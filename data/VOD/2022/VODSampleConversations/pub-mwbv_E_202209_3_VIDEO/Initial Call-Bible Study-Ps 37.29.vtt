May I ask your opinion on this question?

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is it possible to enjoy life forever?”

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you say yes, no, or maybe?

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d say no.

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can appreciate
why you may feel it’s unrealistic.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, I felt the same way as you
when I was first asked that question.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then someone showed me
this promise the Bible makes

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 37:29.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s quoted here, but my friend Lisa
can read it to you from the Bible.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 37:29 reads:

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:43.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will live forever on it.”

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
So according to this Bible promise,

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
righteous people will enjoy life on earth
for how long?

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says “forever.”

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible promises
that people can live forever

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:05.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
in happy, peaceful conditions
such as the ones illustrated here.

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which scene appeals to you the most?

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I like this one.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems so peaceful.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think that we can believe
the Bible’s promise?

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d love for it to be true,
but I really doubt it.

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also used to wonder if the Bible’s promises

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
were just too good to be true.

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the more I learned about the Bible,
the more I trusted it.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
This brochure is designed
to help people learn about the Bible

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build confidence in its promises.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just three lessons,
it gives solid evidence

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
to believe what the Bible promises.

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first lesson is entitled
“How Can the Bible Help You?”

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you how it works.

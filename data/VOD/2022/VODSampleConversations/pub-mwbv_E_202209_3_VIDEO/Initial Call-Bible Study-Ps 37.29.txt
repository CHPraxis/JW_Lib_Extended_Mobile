00:00:07 May I ask your opinion on this question?
00:00:10 “Is it possible to enjoy life forever?”
00:00:13 Would you say yes, no, or maybe?
00:00:15 I’d say no.
00:00:17 Thank you.
00:00:19 I can appreciate why you may feel it’s unrealistic.
00:00:22 In fact, I felt the same way as you when I was first asked that question.
00:00:27 But then someone showed me this promise the Bible makes
00:00:30 at Psalm 37:29.
00:00:32 It’s quoted here, but my friend Lisa can read it to you from the Bible.
00:00:37 Psalm 37:29 reads:
00:00:40 “The righteous will possess the earth,
00:00:43 and they will live forever on it.”
00:00:45 Thank you, Lisa.
00:00:47 So according to this Bible promise,
00:00:49 righteous people will enjoy life on earth for how long?
00:00:53 It says “forever.”
00:00:55 That’s right.
00:00:56 The Bible promises that people can live forever
00:01:00 in happy, peaceful conditions such as the ones illustrated here.
00:01:05 Which scene appeals to you the most?
00:01:07 Hmm, I like this one.
00:01:10 It seems so peaceful.
00:01:18 Do you think that we can believe the Bible’s promise?
00:01:21 I’d love for it to be true, but I really doubt it.
00:01:25 I also used to wonder if the Bible’s promises
00:01:28 were just too good to be true.
00:01:31 But the more I learned about the Bible, the more I trusted it.
00:01:35 This brochure is designed to help people learn about the Bible
00:01:40 and build confidence in its promises.
00:01:42 In just three lessons, it gives solid evidence
00:01:46 to believe what the Bible promises.
00:01:49 The first lesson is entitled “How Can the Bible Help You?”
00:01:53 Let me show you how it works.

00:00:01 Hello.
00:00:02 I’m happy to invite you to a special event
00:00:04 that will be attended by millions of people.
00:00:07 It’s the anniversary of Jesus’ death.
00:00:11 This invitation shows the time and location of the event
00:00:14 in our area.
00:00:16 We also invite you to a special talk the weekend before.
00:00:19 Thanks.
00:00:21 Hmm.
00:00:22 The meetings are free?
00:00:24 Yes.
00:00:25 May I show you this minute-and-a-half video
00:00:27 that explains the significance of this meeting?
00:00:30 Sure.
00:00:33 Imagine a world filled with peace,
00:00:38 free of suffering,
00:00:42 an abundance of food for all,
00:00:46 and life in perfect health.
00:00:52 But how can this beautiful future be possible?
00:00:57 Because of what Jesus did for us.
00:01:02 He came to earth for a purpose.
00:01:06 He gave his life for those he loved.
00:01:13 The night before he died,
00:01:15 Jesus asked that we commemorate his sacrifice.
00:01:20 He said:
00:01:22 “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”
00:01:27 On the anniversary of his death,
00:01:30 people around the world will gather to remember him.
00:01:34 Jehovah’s Witnesses invite you and your family
00:01:37 to attend the Memorial of Jesus’ death.
00:01:41 At that meeting, you will find out
00:01:43 why his sacrifice was so important
00:01:47 and how his promises affect you.
00:01:51 To find a location near you,
00:01:53 please accept an invitation from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:58 or fill in the congregation meeting search form
00:02:01 on jw.org.
00:02:04 I hope you can come.
00:02:07 Thanks.
00:02:08 I need to check with my family,
00:02:10 but maybe you’ll see me there.
00:02:12 My name is Ed.
00:02:14 I’m Pete.
00:02:15 Perhaps the next time we talk,
00:02:17 I can show you what the Bible says about why Jesus died.
00:02:20 Is this normally a good time for you?

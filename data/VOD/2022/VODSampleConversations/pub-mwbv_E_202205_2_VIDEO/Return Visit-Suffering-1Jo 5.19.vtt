Hi, Ian, it’s good to find you home.

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:06.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In case you don’t recall,
my name is Francisco.

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:07.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m Shane.

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.
Good to see you.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too, Ian.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last time we were here,
we left the question, Why do we suffer?

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the answer that the Bible gives here

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 John 5:19.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shane, would you please read that?

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:23.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We know that we originate with God,

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the whole world is lying
in the power of the wicked one.”

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to this verse,
who controls the world?

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it God or someone else?

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “the wicked one.”

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean the Devil?

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the real ruler of the world.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think we’re seeing evidence
of his rule in the world around us?

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For sure, all of the crime
and hatred that exists.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in other parts of the Bible,
it shows that Satan’s influence

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has led to sin and death for all mankind.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve never heard that before,
but it makes a lot of sense.

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:17.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right; it does.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So God doesn’t cause our suffering,

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he does care about it.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe next time we can discuss
how God feels about our suffering.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:29.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may find that the answer addresses

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:32.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of those nagging questions
you’ve had about God.

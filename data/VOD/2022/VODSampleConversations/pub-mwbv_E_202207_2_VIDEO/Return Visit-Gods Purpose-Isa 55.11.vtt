Last time, we discussed that God’s purpose

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:11.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for the earth to be a paradise,

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we left you with the question,

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:15.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be sure
that God’s purpose for humans

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here on earth will still be fulfilled?

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, I’m not really sure.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the Creator’s assurance
here at Isaiah 55:11.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tina, would you please read that for us?

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So my word
that goes out of my mouth will be.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It will not return to me without results,

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it will certainly accomplish
whatever is my delight, 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will have sure success
in what I send it to do.”

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since these
are the words of God himself,

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do we know
that his purpose will be fulfilled?

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he says: “It will have sure success.”

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that interesting?

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:01.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heavenly Father guarantees it.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking again at this verse,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:09.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God says that his word
will “accomplish whatever is [his] delight.”

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:13.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how does he feel
about accomplishing his purpose?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to accomplish it.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he delights to.

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s really looking forward
to bringing mankind happiness.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can be sure
he will fulfill his purpose for the earth.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very touching.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think so too.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will life be like when God
fulfills his purpose for humans?

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss the Bible’s answer
next time we talk.

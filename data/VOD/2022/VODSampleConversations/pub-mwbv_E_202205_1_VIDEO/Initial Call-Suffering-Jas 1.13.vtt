00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:04.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Francisco, and this is Shane.

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May I ask your name?

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:06.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ian.

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nice to meet you, Ian.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:11.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re discussing a question
that many people ask about God.

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God?

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think I believe in God.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re certainly not alone
in questioning whether God exists.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But may I ask,
Have you <i>always</i>  felt that way?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I used to believe in God.

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised that way,
but then everything fell apart.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother got sick, and my father left us.

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just me and my brother

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to take care of Mom until she died.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very sorry to hear that, Ian.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can relate in some ways.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family went through a similar situation.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just don’t understand
why God would do that to us.

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re good people.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to church every Sunday.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never hurt anyone.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me assure you, you’re certainly
not the first to feel that way.

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people have struggled
to understand why bad things happen.

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible’s answer may surprise you.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, that’s one
of the reasons we’re here today.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question
we’ve been discussing from the Bible is,

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know that our suffering
is not punishment from God?

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:40.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please notice what we read here
at James 1:13:

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When under trial, let no one say:
‘I am being tried by God.’

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For with evil things God cannot be tried,

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor does he himself try anyone.”

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the first part of this verse.

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we face trials,

00:01:57.012 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may feel like we’re being tried,
or tested, by God.

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that really the case?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the second part of the verse.

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you agree that if God exists,
he cannot be tested by evil?

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be impossible!

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We agree.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what comforting assurance
do we find in the end of the verse?

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That God does not try us with evil?

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, a logical question is,

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If God isn’t the cause
of our suffering, who or what is?

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next time we’re here, let’s discuss
the principal reason why we suffer.

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:37.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

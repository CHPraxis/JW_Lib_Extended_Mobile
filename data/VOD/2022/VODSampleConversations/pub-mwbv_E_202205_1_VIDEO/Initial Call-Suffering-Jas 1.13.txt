00:00:01 Good morning.
00:00:02 My name is Francisco, and this is Shane.
00:00:04 May I ask your name?
00:00:05 Ian.
00:00:06 It’s nice to meet you, Ian.
00:00:08 We’re discussing a question that many people ask about God.
00:00:11 God?
00:00:13 I don’t think I believe in God.
00:00:20 You’re certainly not alone in questioning whether God exists.
00:00:24 But may I ask, Have you always  felt that way?
00:00:28 Well, I used to believe in God.
00:00:31 I was raised that way, but then everything fell apart.
00:00:36 My mother got sick, and my father left us.
00:00:40 It was just me and my brother
00:00:42 trying to take care of Mom until she died.
00:00:46 I’m very sorry to hear that, Ian.
00:00:48 Me too.
00:00:50 I can relate in some ways.
00:00:51 My family went through a similar situation.
00:00:54 I just don’t understand why God would do that to us.
00:00:58 We’re good people.
00:01:00 We went to church every Sunday.
00:01:02 We never hurt anyone.
00:01:05 Let me assure you, you’re certainly not the first to feel that way.
00:01:09 Many people have struggled to understand why bad things happen.
00:01:13 The Bible’s answer may surprise you.
00:01:15 In fact, that’s one of the reasons we’re here today.
00:01:18 The question we’ve been discussing from the Bible is,
00:01:21 How do we know that our suffering is not punishment from God?
00:01:25 Really?
00:01:27 Yes.
00:01:36 Please notice what we read here at James 1:13:
00:01:41 “When under trial, let no one say: ‘I am being tried by God.’
00:01:46 “For with evil things God cannot be tried,
00:01:49 nor does he himself try anyone.”
00:01:52 Notice the first part of this verse.
00:01:54 When we face trials,
00:01:57 we may feel like we’re being tried, or tested, by God.
00:02:00 But is that really the case?
00:02:03 Notice the second part of the verse.
00:02:06 Would you agree that if God exists, he cannot be tested by evil?
00:02:11 Of course.
00:02:12 That would be impossible!
00:02:13 We agree.
00:02:15 And what comforting assurance do we find in the end of the verse?
00:02:19 That God does not try us with evil?
00:02:22 Exactly!
00:02:23 Of course, a logical question is,
00:02:26 If God isn’t the cause of our suffering, who or what is?
00:02:31 Next time we’re here, let’s discuss the principal reason why we suffer.
00:02:35 OK.

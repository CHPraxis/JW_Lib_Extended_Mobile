00:00:07 We’ve been asking people the question,
00:00:09 Where can we find practical advice for daily living?
00:00:13 What are your thoughts?
00:00:15 Hmm, I don’t know.
00:00:16 Sometimes I ask my friends for advice if I’m not sure what to do.
00:00:25 Thank you.
00:00:26 Friends can offer helpful advice, that’s for sure.
00:00:30 This ancient book of wisdom mentions another source.
00:00:33 Anna, would you please read for us
2 Timothy 3:16, 17?
00:00:38 Sure.
00:00:39 It says: “All Scripture is inspired of God
00:00:42 “and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,
00:00:46 “for setting things straight,
00:00:48 “for disciplining in righteousness,
00:00:51 “so that the man of God may be fully competent,
00:00:54 completely equipped for every good work.”
00:00:57 Thank you.
00:00:58 So did you see in those verses
00:01:00 how the Scriptures, or God’s Word, can help us?
00:01:05 Um, it says: “teaching, . . . disciplining.”
00:01:08 Exactly.
00:01:10 And what do the Scriptures equip us for?
00:01:12 “Every good work”?
00:01:14 Exactly! You got it.
00:01:16 The Bible can help us to improve our lives.
00:01:19 For instance, how can we deal with stress?
00:01:22 How can we enjoy our work?
00:01:24 Or how can our families be happy?
00:01:26 The Bible comments on all of those topics.
00:01:29 Wow!
00:01:31 I thought it was just a religious book.
00:01:33 Many people aren’t aware of the Bible’s practical value.
00:01:43 Other people say that the Bible is full of myths or legends.
00:01:47 The next time I stop by, I’d like to discuss why we can trust the Bible.
00:01:52 Will you be home again next week at this time?
00:01:54 Yeah, I should be around.
00:01:56 Great! Do you text?
00:01:58 If you’d like, I can send you a text before I come.
00:02:00 OK.

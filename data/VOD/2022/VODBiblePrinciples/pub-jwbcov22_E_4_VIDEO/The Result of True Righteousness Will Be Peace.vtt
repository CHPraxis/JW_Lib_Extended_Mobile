00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:12.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you are.

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:16.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you both get the email survey I sent?

00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:17.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re both coming, right?

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:19.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
I must have missed it.
I was on calls all morning.

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:20.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s this about?

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:23.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the whole office is leaving early.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going downtown
to support the march

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
for gay rights.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:30.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
She won’t go.

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:32.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:33.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s against her religion.

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:35.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of her people came by my house,

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I asked, they said your church

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
won’t support gay marriage.

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irene?

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:47.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true.

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we hold to the Bible’s standard on marriage,

00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:54.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is only between a man and woman.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:57.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remain politically neutral.

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:59.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s such ignorant thinking.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand it’s a sensitive subject.

00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a daughter who deserves her rights!

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust me, Amber,
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:16.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
we believe everyone has a right
to choose how they live.

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:19.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I would never force my beliefs on anyone.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:21.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you won’t go.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:23.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as I would never force
my beliefs on you,

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
all I ask is the same respect.

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:29.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, no, I won’t be going.

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:31.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have to go back to work.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, obviously, Irene,

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t agree with your perspective.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I do appreciate
that you not push it on anyone else.

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:46.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great discussion today, everyone.

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:02.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, midterms are this Friday.

00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:04.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
No excuses!

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes you, Jordan.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were noticeably silent
during our discussion today, Olivia.

00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:13.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was?

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I just didn’t have much to say.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:18.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aren’t you concerned about gay rights?

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um,

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, it seems like a political issue,

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:27.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I stay neutral
when it comes to political stuff.

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not a political issue.

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:31.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a human rights issue.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Dallas,

00:02:33.363 --> 00:02:34.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s like crazy religious.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:37.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you don’t understand.

00:02:37.868 --> 00:02:40.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
hate everybody that isn’t straight.

00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:42.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not true! We don’t hate anyone.

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve spoken with your people before.

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:47.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seem big on equality.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are.

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:50.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that ‘God isn’t partial.’

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we believe that everyone
should be treated fairly.

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:57.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:02:57.015 --> 00:03:00.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I assume you have
gay members in your church.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we don’t.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I thought you just said
everyone should be treated equally?

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:11.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m confused.

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:13.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hah, called it!

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jordan, don’t you have a class to get to?

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:19.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was saying,

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:23.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
how is that not a little hypocritical,

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that you love everyone
and then excluding certain people?

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, Mr. Dallas,

00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:42.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve wondered the same thing.

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:44.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:46.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
And?

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:49.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I researched it in the Bible,
and I realized

00:03:49.743 --> 00:03:54.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God accepts all people,
but he doesn’t accept all conduct.

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:58.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:03.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that you can’t be abusing drugs

00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can’t be stealing

00:04:05.928 --> 00:04:09.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
or be violent and still be a Witness.

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:14.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are just certain actions
that God just doesn’t accept.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Including how someone expresses
their sexuality?

00:04:22.947 --> 00:04:24.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases, yes.

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:26.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
We follow God’s standards

00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:28.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not having sex without being married.

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:30.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:35.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
if that’s how you feel, that’s your right.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:39.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, it seems a tad archaic to me but

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:41.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
to each their own.

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:49.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:04:49.937 --> 00:04:50.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:53.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the Bible really say all that?

00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:55.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it does.

00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:57.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK,

00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:58.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe you can show me sometime.

00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:00.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure.

00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Awesome.

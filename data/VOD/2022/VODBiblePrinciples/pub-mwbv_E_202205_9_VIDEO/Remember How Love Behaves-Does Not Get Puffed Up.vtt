David was sick.

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absalom saw this

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an opportunity to seize power.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like his father David,

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:14.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had many gifts.

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was born into a wealthy and powerful family.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned heads wherever he went,

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he relished the attention.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men would come to the city gate

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the king would hear their legal case.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I were appointed judge in the land, every man

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a legal case or judgment could come to me

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would see that he receives justice.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are from the royal house, my lord.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother too has royal blood.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that I was born to lead.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God will do whatâ€™s best for his people.

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absalom seemed to be interested

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the people who came to David,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was only interested in himself.

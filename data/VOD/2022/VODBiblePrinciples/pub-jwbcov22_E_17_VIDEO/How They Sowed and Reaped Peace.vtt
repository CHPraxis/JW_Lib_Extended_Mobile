00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:14.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every morning

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and I mean every morning—

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s Jeremy singing
at the top of his lungs.

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, I wasn’t the only one.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but you were the loudest.

00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:25.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:30.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always impressed
with how close you two were.

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:36.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t always that way.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:41.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, it started out that way.

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:45.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nick and I—we weren’t just brothers;

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:47.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were friends.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the family business
ran into trouble,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what started
as a small disagreement just exploded.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t even understand at all
how our business works!

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:02.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of criticizing,
could you just once . . .

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:05.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremy!

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:09.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost us?

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:11.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a choice.
You went behind my back!

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your problem?

00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:16.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
You!
You’re the problem.

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:27.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to work it out.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
But things just got worse.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a door
had slammed shut between us.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the outside,
I acted like everything was fine.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
But inside, I couldn’t let it go.

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:56.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like a total hypocrite,

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that had to change.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let go

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to move on—

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make things right with Nick.

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took a long time
for the wounds to heal . . .

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:44.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and for us to trust each other
the way we used to.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we did.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:02.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful that we made peace

00:03:06.298 --> 00:03:08.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the world turned upside down.

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:25.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pandemic lasted longer
than any of us expected,

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:31.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the conflicting news reports
just added to the stress.

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:36.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then my sister lost her job
and had to move in with us.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yeah, it was me

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:44.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Kelly, Nicole, and Dad.

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:48.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty seconds, Son

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:50.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
—twenty seconds.

00:03:57.517 --> 00:03:58.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll see you later.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, where’s your mask?

00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:02.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry.

00:04:02.815 --> 00:04:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, you can use this one. 

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:06.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t get near anyone.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:08.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gary.

00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:09.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody at the warehouse is wearing masks.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you know how many people
have actually gotten sick?

00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:16.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:18.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far.

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:22.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw the last Governing Body update.

00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:23.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t let down our guard.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:26.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, I get it.

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:27.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK?

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I think it’s great that the brothers
are trying to keep us safe.

00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:34.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
But . . .

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what?

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:40.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think that they’re,
you know, overreacting?

00:04:56.787 --> 00:05:00.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, it wasn’t
the brothers who had the problem.

00:05:03.628 --> 00:05:05.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:11.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
A week later, I found out that a friend
in our service group

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:13.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
was in the hospital with COVID-19.

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:18.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was young, and he had been taking
all the right precautions.

00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:22.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had really let my guard down.

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:30.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is not the time

00:05:30.823 --> 00:05:35.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
to slacken our hand when it comes to safety.

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let your guard down.

00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:43.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t think the virus
can’t affect you or your family.

00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:49.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how the organization
was really trying to protect us

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how much my decisions
were affecting others,

00:05:54.973 --> 00:05:57.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the people I love the most.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the pandemic dragged on,

00:06:02.397 --> 00:06:06.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned the importance
of being humble and obedient.

00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:15.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following Jehovah’s direction
didn’t just help us stay safe,

00:06:19.373 --> 00:06:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
it brought us peace.

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:38.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know how Jehovah’s people are.

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:41.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
When there’s a need,

00:06:41.146 --> 00:06:43.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers step up.

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:45.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though we had

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:47.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of work to do back then,

00:06:47.194 --> 00:06:49.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
we always had willing workers

00:06:51.156 --> 00:06:56.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so many workers that some started to feel
like they were being overlooked.

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:02.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Ray!
What’s up?

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Matt,

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:07.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hear you’re organizing
the food distribution for our congregation.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I’m trying my best.

00:07:10.051 --> 00:07:12.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, can I give you a hand?
My truck is all ready to go.

00:07:13.513 --> 00:07:17.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
We actually just finished loading up
for the day, so I think we’re good.

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:20.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, wow, yeah,
thank you very much for offering.

00:07:21.772 --> 00:07:24.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
When’s the next run?

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:26.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what, Ray?

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:27.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re about to pull out right now.

00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:29.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it OK if I call you back?

00:07:29.738 --> 00:07:31.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray was such a hard worker,

00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:42.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than most of us even realized.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
He put his heart into every assignment.

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:47.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was that?

00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:48.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I told him

00:07:48.716 --> 00:07:51.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
we already had all the help we needed,

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:52.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
it didn’t go the way I hoped.

00:07:53.722 --> 00:07:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray, I think you’re muted.

00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:02.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what you’re saying is
you don’t think I’m qualified to help out.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:04.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, we just—

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know how hard
you’re working caring for your mom.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:07.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want to . . .

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:10.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t Paul Thompson on your crew?

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:11.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but—

00:08:11.907 --> 00:08:13.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Oliver Kagan?

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oliver’s my assistant, yes, but—

00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:16.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does this work, Matt?

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you just use your friends,

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you shut the rest of us out.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think I notice
how you brothers ignore me?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:32.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray, I owe you an apology.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should’ve spoken with you
about this right from the start.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re working so hard
taking care of your mom.

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last thing we wanted to do
was make things harder for you.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:51.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even more than that,

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:54.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t want to have to ask you
to do something

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would put you
or your mother at higher risk.

00:08:58.414 --> 00:08:59.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:01.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worry about that too.

00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:04.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:09:04.253 --> 00:09:08.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
your mom
—we wouldn’t want anything to happen to her.

00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:11.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s one of our congregation treasures.

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:15.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re not so bad either.

00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:21.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seriously, you’re such a good example.

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:23.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how Jehovah must feel when he sees

00:09:23.857 --> 00:09:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
all that you’re doing
for us and for your mom.

00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:31.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:34.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means a lot to me.

00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:37.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
If something comes up
that I can help with then

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:40.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even just a little—
and I can do it from home—

00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:42.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a good point.

00:09:42.877 --> 00:09:44.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I can get your thoughts
on something, if that’s OK?

00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:53.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later on,

00:09:53.263 --> 00:09:55.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
when things got even more intense,

00:09:55.723 --> 00:09:58.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when our peace
was really put to the test.

00:10:00.478 --> 00:10:04.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, Tim, you always
found a way to keep us positive.

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:10.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I learned a lot about that
from my better half.

00:10:10.197 --> 00:10:12.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amy has always had a way
of bringing people together.

00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:16.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, just before the pandemic,

00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:19.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were these two pioneer sisters
in our congregation.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Becky was energetic, industrious,
and fearless in her ministry,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Lena was experienced, self-sacrificing,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and such a good Bible teacher.

00:10:32.553 --> 00:10:35.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they didn’t exactly get along.

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:52.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready to go?

00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:54.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

00:10:54.368 --> 00:10:56.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just— It’s Becky.

00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:59.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s just such a phantom pioneer.

00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:01.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never see her.

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:03.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, but she just needs
to be more serious

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:05.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
about her ministry.

00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she’s been doing
metro witnessing and . . .

00:11:07.673 --> 00:11:09.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, I know, and LDC too, right?

00:11:09.717 --> 00:11:11.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does plumbing?

00:11:11.928 --> 00:11:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concrete.

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:15.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does have a lot of energy!

00:11:17.392 --> 00:11:19.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
when we used to be like that?

00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:21.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know that I was ever like Becky.

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:23.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you weren’t.

00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:25.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were Beckyer than Becky.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t keep up with you

00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:29.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those long service days
in your little red car.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
That feels like a long time ago.

00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:40.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Becky reminds me a lot of you

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I mean both of us—

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
twenty years ago.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s working so hard,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s made
so many sacrifices

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the truth,
just like you have.

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:56.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we should get together

00:11:56.641 --> 00:11:58.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the three of us.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:00.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should get to know her better.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:07.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next week,
I had them both over to the house.

00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:12.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the more those two
got to know each other,

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
the closer they became.

00:12:17.788 --> 00:12:22.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that proverb:
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”?

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amy taught me what that verse really means.

00:12:27.173 --> 00:12:29.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, everyone out!

00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:39.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
When everything changed

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:42.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we suddenly
found ourselves locked up together,

00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:46.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to show that same spirit

00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:48.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could stay united.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with Jehovah’s help,

00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:01.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did.

00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:13.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first time we met David,

00:13:13.262 --> 00:13:15.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were in chains!

00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d seen a lot of things
during my time as a guard,

00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:23.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
but nothing like the peace that you all had.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prison chains may be strong,

00:13:25.483 --> 00:13:28.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we all had something much stronger.

00:13:30.113 --> 00:13:32.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we had to work for that peace.

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:34.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right, Phil?

00:13:34.743 --> 00:13:36.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:13:37.162 --> 00:13:42.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, there was a misunderstanding

00:13:42.126 --> 00:13:44.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
that got blown all out of proportion.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t handle it the best.

00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:54.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more I tried to defend myself,
the worse it became.

00:13:55.306 --> 00:13:58.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

00:13:59.394 --> 00:14:01.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t true.

00:14:01.104 --> 00:14:02.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know me!

00:14:08.987 --> 00:14:11.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t prepared
for how far it would go.

00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:13.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one more announcement.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Philip Kim
is no longer serving as an elder.

00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that brings our meeting to a close.

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:22.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we can stand.

00:14:23.544 --> 00:14:26.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next few months were a real struggle.

00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:30.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when more details came to light,

00:14:30.843 --> 00:14:32.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I’d be reappointed,

00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:35.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I wasn’t.

00:14:42.146 --> 00:14:43.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil!

00:14:43.523 --> 00:14:45.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand why.

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:46.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil, come on . . .

00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:51.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt bitterness growing inside.

00:14:51.198 --> 00:14:52.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil, you know . . .

00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:04.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything became about me

00:15:04.878 --> 00:15:08.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how I felt, what I deserved.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:14.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like a fog that stopped me
from seeing what Jehovah deserved,

00:15:15.097 --> 00:15:17.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I really needed his help.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:23.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort
in accounts of Jehovah’s servants

00:15:23.106 --> 00:15:26.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were either misunderstood or misjudged

00:15:28.612 --> 00:15:30.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maintained their loyalty to Him.

00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:41.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me realize that it’s a privilege

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be in Jehovah’s organization.

00:15:45.754 --> 00:15:47.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being at peace with my brothers

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important
than any appointed position.

00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:58.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without peace, I don’t know
how we could’ve managed what was to come.

00:16:08.111 --> 00:16:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your arthritis bad today?

00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:13.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I’ll be your secretary

00:16:13.074 --> 00:16:15.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Baruch was to Jeremiah.

00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:18.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what I’d do without you.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know, there is more to the story.

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil didn’t know just

00:16:35.556 --> 00:16:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:41.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:44.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never talked,

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:47.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean really talked, about it

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it was too late.

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:03.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to talk.

00:17:08.007 --> 00:17:11.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we need to seriously reconsider
Phil’s qualifications.

00:17:11.302 --> 00:17:12.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know he’s not
the type of brother that . . .

00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:15.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enough. Enough!
Enough about Phil.

00:17:15.806 --> 00:17:17.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know he’s your friend, . . .

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:18.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friend?

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:20.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . but the body agreed that he
no longer qualified to serve as an elder.

00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:22.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friend?
Friend?

00:17:22.105 --> 00:17:24.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s worked with us for years!

00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:27.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
The body decided, unanimously,

00:17:27.402 --> 00:17:28.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he should no longer serve.

00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:30.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you pushed them!

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:37.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s enough that we have
those outside the congregation

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting pressure on us;
we do not need more in here!

00:17:38.747 --> 00:17:39.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you seriously think . . .

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:46.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conversation
—the argument—

00:17:46.004 --> 00:17:48.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was terrible.

00:17:48.382 --> 00:17:50.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both said things we didn’t mean.

00:17:52.178 --> 00:17:55.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after that,
we both handled the situation poorly.

00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
We needed to make things right.

00:18:34.263 --> 00:18:36.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy,

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we talked it out.

00:18:41.312 --> 00:18:44.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we made peace with Jehovah’s help.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what it would have been like
in that cellblock if we hadn’t?

00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:58.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
We finally told Phil the whole story
once we were all roommates.

00:18:58.747 --> 00:18:59.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:03.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re ready!

00:19:03.585 --> 00:19:05.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go sing.

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:09.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an island of calm
In dark stormy seas,

00:19:09.383 --> 00:19:15.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people are living in peace.

00:19:15.264 --> 00:19:22.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our eyes of faith,
We see beyond the clouds

00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:27.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that the storm soon will cease.

00:19:27.944 --> 00:19:34.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:19:34.117 --> 00:19:38.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:19:38.622 --> 00:19:41.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below . . .

00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:50.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one more story to tell.

00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:54.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know it at the time,

00:19:54.013 --> 00:19:56.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
but seeds of truth

00:19:56.807 --> 00:19:58.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
were being planted in my heart.

00:20:04.607 --> 00:20:07.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were all so different.

00:20:07.026 --> 00:20:09.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand it.

00:20:13.825 --> 00:20:16.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were prisoners, yes,

00:20:16.661 --> 00:20:18.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you felt free

00:20:23.543 --> 00:20:25.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
—truly free.

00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:31.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
After you were released,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
it became clear to me

00:20:35.848 --> 00:20:39.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have God’s blessing,

00:20:39.268 --> 00:20:41.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted to know why.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil helped me find the answer.

00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:51.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you will know the truth,

00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:54.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truth will set you free.”

00:20:56.703 --> 00:20:59.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil encouraged me to make the truth my own.

00:21:00.665 --> 00:21:04.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had real trouble at first.

00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:07.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
With all the turmoil going on at the time,

00:21:07.214 --> 00:21:10.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea of being peaceable

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:13.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waiting on God’s Kingdom

00:21:15.389 --> 00:21:17.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was hard to grasp.

00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:26.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s help

00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:30.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the patience of these good people,

00:21:32.907 --> 00:21:36.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized
before the start of the great tribulation.

00:21:45.962 --> 00:21:49.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph, during our time in prison,

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
the story of your life

00:21:51.051 --> 00:21:52.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
—your time in prison

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:54.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah was always with you—

00:21:54.888 --> 00:21:56.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
became a real source of strength

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us.

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one day,

00:22:01.228 --> 00:22:03.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Carl said—

00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:05.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:09.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “One day,
we’ll have a meal with Joseph,

00:22:09.987 --> 00:22:13.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll say ‘thank you.’”

00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:15.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we are!

00:22:15.743 --> 00:22:18.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, it’s I who should thank you.

00:22:18.955 --> 00:22:22.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each and every one
of your stories

00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:24.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
touches my heart.

00:22:24.628 --> 00:22:27.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know a lot about my life,

00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:30.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
but would it be all right
if I shared a few more stories?

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please!

00:22:31.343 --> 00:22:32.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have so many questions.

00:22:32.803 --> 00:22:34.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about Egypt?

00:22:34.179 --> 00:22:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Pharaoh really like?

00:22:35.389 --> 00:22:36.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dreams!

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to talk about those dreams.

00:22:40.227 --> 00:22:43.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
You do have many questions!

00:22:43.731 --> 00:22:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have many details to share.

00:22:46.943 --> 00:22:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thanks to our God, Jehovah,

00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:52.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have all the time we need.

00:00:01.564 --> 00:00:03.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I expected more from you.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:09.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossiping about my posts!

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:13.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:18.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley,

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:23.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
wait, please!

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:24.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know what’s happening.

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:28.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you talk to Emily about my posts?

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we did . . .

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you gossiped about me.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I would . . .

00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
I looked up to you!

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never . . .

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:35.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re supposed to be the mature one,

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:37.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re just like Emily,
busy running your mouth.

00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:38.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley!

00:00:39.855 --> 00:00:43.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I can see you’re upset,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
but trust me,
this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never ever say anything
behind your back.

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please calm down.

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:09.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I just feel so alone

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:15.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
—between Nana and work—

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:20.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then knowing all of you
are talking about me.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:25.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise, that’s not what happened.

00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:30.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just really tired and overwhelmed.

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:34.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why don’t we
just slow things down a little.

00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:40.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, meetings
always make me feel better,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
even on my worst days.

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:46.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we go inside,

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:50.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
clean up a little,
and enjoy the program together.

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then afterward, we can all talk.

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:57.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise, it’ll be OK.

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:12.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how this happened

00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:18.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, Haley, I’m sorry.

00:02:18.418 --> 00:02:21.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hurts me to see you so upset.

00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:28.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t believe you two.

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:30.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
First,

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:33.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you heard

00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not what I said.

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I thought that was how you felt.

00:02:42.903 --> 00:02:46.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if I got that part wrong,
all this drama?

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now stop!

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:51.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, girls.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, come closer.

00:03:04.593 --> 00:03:09.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.”

00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:17.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not jealous.

00:03:23.154 --> 00:03:25.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t become provoked,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when things become difficult.

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are we going to do?

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought if—

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:47.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, Haley.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:57.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you so harshly.

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:01.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you at all.

00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:11.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m sorry for dragging you into this
by twisting what you said.

00:04:12.624 --> 00:04:16.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK; things happen.

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been on both ends.

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:30.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should never have spoken
that way to you, Celia

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:36.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I mean, to either of you.

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:44.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to get home to Nana.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll call you tomorrow.

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:52.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:22.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, it’s me.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been thinking of you.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great broadcast.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you like the new original song?

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:31.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give us a call.

00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:53.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wish she’d give it a rest.

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:54.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:05:54.483 --> 00:05:55.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.

00:05:57.778 --> 00:06:01.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, it’s just Emily
for the millionth time.

00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the problem, love?

00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:06.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no problem.

00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:07.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just . . .

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . difficult to let her back in?

00:06:27.727 --> 00:06:29.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not that simple?

00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:32.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not that simple.

00:06:34.108 --> 00:06:35.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to forgive . . .

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . but not get burned again.

00:06:43.243 --> 00:06:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t want to miss that opportunity.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never thought about it like that.

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time
when you wanted forgiveness

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:09.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when it meant everything.

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:12.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did it feel?

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:13.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . just like your Nana does as well.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:14.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
She really deeply cares about you.

00:07:14.944 --> 00:07:16.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
You feel awful

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:21.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ve let everyone down.

00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:24.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re very precious.

00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:26.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they forgive you,

00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:38.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suddenly everything is OK.

00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:52.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily, sorry I haven’t been back to you.

00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:56.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have plans for tomorrow?

00:08:04.497 --> 00:08:06.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just need a bit of help.

00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:08.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think I should do
for my winter collection?

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I don’t know,
but I love what you did with your new stuff,

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:14.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
this set.

00:08:18.595 --> 00:08:20.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve all given me so many great ideas.

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:26.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you make them.

00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:27.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:29.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, girls.

00:08:31.442 --> 00:08:33.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
You love it.

00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:37.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, this is my song.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mine too.

00:08:39.493 --> 00:08:42.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have a treasured place

00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:44.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in Jehovah’s house;

00:08:44.665 --> 00:08:48.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’ll help you out [out].

00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:48.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you have . . .”

00:08:48.836 --> 00:08:50.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, I sing like a crow.

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, stop!

00:08:53.674 --> 00:08:58.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll tell you who else thinks it’s her song,
but you’d better have earplugs handy

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Veronica.

00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:04.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness!
She’s in love with her own voice.

00:09:04.936 --> 00:09:06.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ever sit near her at the hall?

00:09:06.855 --> 00:09:10.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like she’s the only one that can sing.
And she’s such a diva.

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:15.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
My first thought:
‘Oh, no! Here we go again!

00:09:15.614 --> 00:09:18.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen this movie before.’

00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:20.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:09:20.578 --> 00:09:22.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:26.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems it’s all about Haley.

00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:30.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:35.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve lived it.

00:09:37.429 --> 00:09:41.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s a case of her being more careful
how she comes across,

00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s another matter.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she suggest?

00:09:46.439 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I should tell her
that she needs to stop.

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:51.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:54.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially as a pioneer,
what kind of example is she setting?

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:57.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
How quickly it snowballs out of control!

00:09:57.701 --> 00:09:58.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:00.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:10:00.412 --> 00:10:03.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! I can’t believe you.

00:10:03.249 --> 00:10:06.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:10.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley!

00:10:14.594 --> 00:10:18.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
How difficult it can be to unravel!

00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:21.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you so harshly.

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:28.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you at all.

00:10:29.735 --> 00:10:33.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
A chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:37.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time
when you wanted forgiveness.

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:49.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has anyone ever tried talking to her
about her singing?

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:55.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what I love about Veronica?

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:59.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s probably the most hospitable person
I know.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always open house at her place.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can she cook!

00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:04.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you tried her curry?

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:05.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t tried it yet.

00:11:05.857 --> 00:11:07.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s so good.

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:08.569 line:90% position:50% align:center

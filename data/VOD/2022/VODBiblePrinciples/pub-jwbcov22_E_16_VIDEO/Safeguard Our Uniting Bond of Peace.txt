00:00:04 In Japan,
00:00:06 religious rituals are associated with each stage of life
00:00:09 and with each season of the year.
00:00:13 As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:15 we want to keep the cleanliness and unity
00:00:18 of the congregation.
00:00:20 In this regard, one of the most delicate areas
00:00:24 is the decision on whether to attend a non-Witness funeral or not.
00:00:31 The first thing we must consider regarding funerals is not to be involved
00:00:35 in religious rituals and acts of worship that are condemned by the Bible.
00:00:41 In harmony with the principle
00:00:43 at 2 Corinthians 6:14,
00:00:46 we need to keep completely separate
00:00:48 from pagan acts of worship.
00:00:52 Next, even if we don’t participate in the worship of other religions,
00:00:57 we need to consider if our decisions could stumble someone in the congregation.
00:01:03 When we consider the Bible principle
00:01:06 at Luke 17:2,
00:01:08 we do not want our decisions to hinder
00:01:11 the faith of someone in the congregation.
00:01:18 The third point to think about is our conscience.
00:01:23 We need to seriously think about the Bible principle
00:01:25 at Galatians 6:5, where it says
00:01:29 that each must “carry his own load.”
00:01:33 This Bible principle
00:01:35 also applies when elders want to support others.
00:01:39 Of course, those in the congregation can ask the elders for support
00:01:44 in issues related to funerals.
00:01:47 However, in matters of conscience,
00:01:50 elders cannot force decisions on others.
00:01:55 So it would be wrong to make some kind of rule
00:01:57 regarding attending non-Witness funerals.
00:02:01 If each person can make
00:02:03 decisions based on Bible principles,
00:02:06 we can have a truly peaceful
00:02:08 and free atmosphere
00:02:10 where each individual’s differing situation
00:02:12 is respected.
00:02:16 This would really contribute to the unity of the congregation.
00:02:20 And all can maintain a clean conscience
00:02:22 and serve happily before Jehovah.
00:02:28 In my culture,
00:02:30 specifically the Namibian Oshiwambo culture,
00:02:32 like in many African cultures,
00:02:35 there are many spiritistic customs related to weddings
00:02:39 that are included in wedding celebrations.
00:02:42 Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth.
00:02:44 So obviously, for Ben and I,
00:02:46 that was one of the main concerns.
00:02:49 They don’t understand our worship of Jehovah,
00:02:51 and they don’t understand that we apply Bible principles
00:02:54 and not the traditions of men.
00:02:56 We got engaged before the pandemic,
00:02:58 but obviously, now that our wedding was to be over videoconferencing,
00:03:02 it meant that we didn’t have control over many things.
00:03:05 We tried to imagine situations
00:03:07 that could stumble our brothers or disrupt
00:03:09 the unity in the congregation.
00:03:14 We had to, in advance,
00:03:16 think of Bible principles that would apply in our case,
00:03:19 but particularly what we also found helpful was speaking to a mature elder.
00:03:24 He gave us a principle at Proverbs 14:15.
00:03:29 He told us to be very careful when people say,
00:03:32 “I will do this” or “I won’t do this” at your wedding.
00:03:36 Basically, it was up to us to make sure that the proceedings
00:03:40 or things that happen at our wedding
00:03:42 would be in order and in harmony with Bible principles.
00:03:46 Another principle that came to mind was
00:03:48 1 Corinthians 10:23.
00:03:51 So obviously, we knew that we had the right to do many things,
00:03:55 but we were also very conscious
00:03:57 of how our brothers would view our wedding.
00:04:01 We didn’t want anybody to be at our wedding and feel embarrassed
00:04:05 or even stumbled to be there.
00:04:08 Now looking back at our wedding,
00:04:11 we look back with fond memories.
00:04:14 So applying Bible principles didn’t restrict our fun.
00:04:21 Also, it contributed to the unity among our brothers
00:04:23 because all of us —those present, those who were invited—
00:04:26 were able to enjoy the wedding.
00:04:28 You’re not worried about thinking, ‘Oh, did that thing offend anybody?’
00:04:31 So you’re able to enjoy the day without any bad memories.

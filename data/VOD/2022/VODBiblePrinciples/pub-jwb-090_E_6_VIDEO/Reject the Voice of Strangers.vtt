00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Smells wonderful.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, wait. I forgot.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should cook every night.

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you clean every night.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, no, we’ll take it in turns.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this looks amazing!

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s practice for my first guest.

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really? Who?

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:54.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful!

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had our first phone call in a year
that wasn’t a total disaster.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I invited her around tomorrow.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll go great.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Mum.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, love.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice to see you.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice to see you too.

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:40.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me take that.

00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks, my love.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s fine.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:56.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your roommates,
did you say they’re explorers?

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pioneers

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they preach full-time,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they work part-time.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I see.

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re not?

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not yet anyway.

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:15.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, love,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
all this,

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see it’s made you a better person.

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:22.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Heaven knows I tried.

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I miss bits of the old Jade.

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bits?
What, what bits?

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the Jade that questioned everything?

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then she pulls out her phone
and starts showing me stuff about Witnesses.

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of stuff?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
News stories, all negative and slanted.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to change the subject,
but she just kept at it.

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:54.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, girls.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye, Keesha.

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, I’ve got to get ready.

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:26.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how long are you going to be gone for?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll stay another month.

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told my daughter it’s too hot here.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:33.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s happened to me?

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abigay.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade girl.
How are you?

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Been better.

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:45.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neeta said that your mother visited.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you don’t mind.

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:48.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:50.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum’s driving me mad.

00:03:50.084 --> 00:03:53.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s—it’s like it’s her hobby
to ruin my life.

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh,

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
she sounds wonderful,

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
like me when my daughter got baptized.

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
You opposed your daughter?

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, mercy, yes.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love her so much.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t want to lose her.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m not going anywhere.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:17.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not,
but a worried mother doesn’t know that.

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:20.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mother, lunch is ready.

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to go,

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I have a scripture for you.

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you read it,

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember your Mum is not the “stranger.”

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:36.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 10:5:

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:43.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will by no means follow a stranger

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but will flee from him,

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:50.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they do not know
the voice of strangers.”

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:57.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum is not the “stranger.”

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:00.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what she shares.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reject the voice,”

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:10.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
not her.

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:17.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you look at those links that I sent you?

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum,

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want us to get together,

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:27.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I won’t hear anything negative
about my beliefs.

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:32.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps we just won’t talk religion.

00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:34.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a deal then?

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:35.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can see I’m not going to get anywhere.

00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:39.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what subject do you want to talk about?

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:46.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
The deal fell apart

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
—fast.

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:53.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I know
we weren’t going to talk religion,

00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:56.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I must tell you
this one thing that I read.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum, I thought
we weren’t going to talk about this!

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s getting late.

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to go.

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:13.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for dinner.

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:15.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll call you tomorrow.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I got an alert this morning
that I really wanted—

00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:36.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum, no.
I don’t—

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:40.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sure this wouldn’t work.

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:45.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it happened.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I’d like to change our agreement.

00:06:50.472 --> 00:06:52.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I ask you what you believe,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get to answer.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Short answers
—I won’t be converting.

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:05.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a deal then?

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:07.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s a deal.

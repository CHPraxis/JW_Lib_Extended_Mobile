Abner had been chief of Saul’s army.

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He pursued David in the wilderness

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:09.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and supported David’s rival

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after David became king.

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:14.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why was Abner coming to see David?

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:20.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord the king,

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a covenant with us.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now support you as king

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah has promised us

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
salvation by means of your hand.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will make a covenant with you.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David trusted Abner and hoped that he would

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now remain loyal.

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:52.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Joab saw things differently.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have you done?

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know Abner!

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came here to fool you and to get

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:57.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know your every move

00:00:57.828 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find out everything that you’re doing!

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful.

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the law:

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You must not hold a grudge,

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you must love your fellow man as yourself.’

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joab’s distrust grew into vengeance.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He later killed Abner.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:21.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who hate expect the worst,

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those who love never lose hope.

00:00:06 I was a leader in a far-right organization
00:00:08 that actively supported apartheid in the 1980’s.
00:00:13 We were on holiday at the sea,
00:00:14 and there were only black lifeguards.
00:00:18 I said to my friends with me that, “I would rather drown
00:00:21 before I would allow a black man to rescue me in the sea.”
00:00:25 The second day we were there, the current pulled me out to sea,
00:00:28 and the harder I tried to come out,
00:00:31 the deeper the sea pulled me in.
00:00:34 The next moment I see this black man coming toward me,
00:00:37 and I grab him around the neck, and I almost wanted to kiss him.
00:00:41 That is how glad I was to see him —because I was drowning!
00:00:44 I was totally exhausted. I could not go on.
00:00:48 Even though a black man saved my life,
00:00:50 it did not change my attitude toward them.
00:02:25 Times started to change in the late eighties,
00:02:28 when they started to dismantle apartheid.
00:02:31 But we aggressively tried to stop this from happening.
00:02:34 We even drove an armored vehicle,
00:02:36 smashing through the doors, into the parliament buildings.
00:02:39 We were trying to see if we could resist these changes
00:02:42 with apartheid, but this did not change things.
00:02:46 Even though I belonged to a church,
00:02:49 I still drank heavily and had extramarital affairs.
00:02:52 This led to me and my wife getting divorced.
00:02:55 It was an empty life.
00:02:57 I was never really happy.
00:04:15 A friend of mine introduced me to the Witnesses.
00:04:18 One of the brothers I met asked me,
00:04:21 “If I prove from the Bible that something you believe is incorrect,
00:04:24 what will you do?”
00:04:27 I said, “Then I will become a Witness.”
00:04:29 He went on to show me in the Bible
00:04:31 how the Bethlehem star was actually from the Devil
00:04:34 to lead the wise men to kill Jesus.
00:04:38 This changed my whole life.
00:04:40 I said, “Now I can become a Witness.”
00:04:48 Being in the Kingdom Hall, I noticed that there were many black people.
00:04:53 This was strange for me.
00:04:55 But the more I attended, the more I began to learn that with Jehovah
00:04:58 there is no partiality.
00:05:00 All people are equal.
00:05:03 We began to accept that this is the way it should be.
00:05:10 Johny and I were brought together
00:05:12 even though we were from completely different political parties.
00:05:15 Before, we would have wanted to kill each other,
00:05:18 but now we have love for one another.
00:05:21 We have forgiven one another.
00:05:23 Jehovah’s organization changes a person completely.
00:05:26 If I think back to the kind of person I was,
00:05:29 and what I am now,
00:05:31 I never want to be what I was then.
00:05:33 Never!
00:05:38 It is such a privilege to be a Witness.
00:05:42 People call me a softy, but I do not mind.
00:05:45 I have become a softy, but for Jehovah.

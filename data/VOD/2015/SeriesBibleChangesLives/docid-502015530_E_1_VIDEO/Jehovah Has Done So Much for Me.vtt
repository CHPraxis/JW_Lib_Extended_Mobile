When I was 14,
things that happened in the past

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like everything
that happened in my life was my fault.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did then try to take my life.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was little,
a family friend sexually abused me,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued to do so for many years.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t tell anyone what was going on.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even tell my dad.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just tried to act normal
—to block it all out.

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that Dad looked into lots

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of different religions
while I was growing up.

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day Jehovah’s Witnesses
knocked on our door.

00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their sincerity was very evident.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were clearly interested

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in us as people and were sincerely offering

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to get to know Jehovah and the Bible.

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning from the Bible that God says

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:15.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will take my right hand,

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will fortify me,
that he will really help me

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it blew me away!

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to a Kingdom Hall,

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could feel the love
and sincerity and warmth

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everyone in there right away,
and it put me at ease.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:43.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has done so much for me personally.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to help as many people benefit
from that same relationship with our God.

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the last 12 years,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been doing
full-time Bible education work.

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:02.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, my life is not perfect.

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still struggle from time to time,

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with negative thinking
and emotions.

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I need to get up and do something,

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do some physical activity.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when I have
the memories coming back,

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like I’m watching a bad movie,

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and somehow I need to change the channel.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to pray down at the beach.

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me feel very close to Jehovah.

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming to know Jehovah has given my life

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning and purpose.

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:52.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember learning the promise from God.

00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:56.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says that ‘I’m making all things new’

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that ‘these things
will not come up into the heart

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will they come up into the mind.’

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:06.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t wait for that time,
and I’m so grateful for that promise.

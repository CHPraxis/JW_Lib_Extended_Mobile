00:00:02 Brother van Elburg was a young Dutchman
00:00:05 raised during the post-World War I era,
00:00:07 who enjoyed life like all young men his age.
00:00:10 He loved playing chess and following the latest football results
00:00:15 and was the proud father of two children
00:00:18 —his daughter, Henny, and his son, Fritz.
00:00:21 Together with his wife, Lies,
00:00:23 he created a cozy home for them,
00:00:25 which was located in the Azaleastraat,
00:00:28 in the city of Zwolle, in the Netherlands.
00:00:33 My parents had the habit
00:00:35 of studying together on Saturday evening,
00:00:38 and I had to read the first two paragraphs.
00:00:42 And I also had to answer the questions.
00:00:44 Well, this stayed with me
00:00:46 for the rest of my life.
00:00:50 Herman loved sharing the Bible’s message
00:00:53 of a peaceful future with his fellow citizens of Zwolle,
00:00:57 showing that the day will come when nations
00:00:59 no longer will go to war against each other.
00:01:04 However,
00:01:06 things were about to change.
00:01:09 In 1939,
00:01:11 neighboring Germany started World War II.
00:01:15 Because the Nazis were set on exterminating Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:19 many of them had to flee the country.
00:01:23 Moved by unselfish love, Herman opened his home to offer them shelter.
00:01:29 One day, my father said to my mother:
00:01:32 “Lies, I received a letter from the Society.
00:01:35 A brother is coming to stay with us.”
00:01:38 My mother said: “Oh, Herman, this can’t go on like that.
00:01:43 We won’t be able to feed all of them.”
00:01:46 To which my father replied: “But, Lies, I’m a butcher.
00:01:50 There will be enough meat for all.”
00:01:55 On May 10, 1940,
00:01:57 Germany invaded the Netherlands.
00:02:01 Now Herman and his family were also
00:02:03 at risk of falling prey to the Nazi regime.
00:02:09 Among their neighbors
00:02:11 was a family that was very active
00:02:13 in pro-German politics during the war.
00:02:15 Another man was responsible for the arrest
00:02:17 of a significant number of Jews.
00:02:20 In between these two lived the van Elburg family.
00:02:24 Eventually, Herman was betrayed to the police and was arrested.
00:02:30 His arrestors were determined
00:02:32 to get information concerning the people he was helping.
00:02:35 The police resorted to violence,
00:02:37 beating him severely.
00:02:40 Because of his love for his fellow Christians and his love for God,
00:02:44 Herman kept his lips sealed.
00:02:48 Mister van Elburg never revealed any names.
00:02:51 During the war that meant signing your own death warrant.
00:02:54 Not knowing what had happened to her husband,
00:02:56 Lies van Elburg went to the local police station.
00:03:01 While she was away, the authorities raided their home.
00:03:05 Suddenly, the door flung open and two men entered the room
00:03:10 and started moving things around.
00:03:13 They pushed a table to one side, pulled up the carpet,
00:03:16 and started looking under the floor.
00:03:20 They found all the literature we had hidden,
00:03:23 as well as clothing of brothers,
00:03:26 which my father had hidden in the cavity wall.
00:03:28 The authorities confiscated the literature Herman had hidden in his home.
00:03:34 The literature found at his place wasn’t his but that of his congregation,
00:03:38 but he never mentioned the names of those who had brought it.
00:03:41 That to me makes this very special.
00:03:43 Unwilling to waver in their determination
00:03:46 to protect their fellow believers,
00:03:49 Herman and Lies van Elburg were both imprisoned.
00:03:55 Together with my grandfather,
00:03:57 I visited my mother.
00:04:00 We had to walk across the huge courtyard.
00:04:05 While we were walking,
00:04:07 I suddenly heard, “Henny.”
00:04:12 And there was my father, and he gave me an apple.
00:04:16 That’s the last I ever saw of my father.
00:04:20 Eventually, Herman and Lies
00:04:23 were sent to concentration camps.
00:04:25 Herman was sent to Dachau.
00:04:28 Lies was transferred
00:04:30 to the Ravensbrück concentration camp.
00:04:33 While she returned home after a while,
00:04:36 Herman van Elburg did not.
00:04:39 He died on February 17, 1943,
00:04:43 at the age of 30,
00:04:45 leaving behind his bereaved wife and two children.
00:04:50 Of course,
00:04:52 the Witnesses as a whole were deeply impacted by the war.
00:04:56 What really strikes me is that they
00:04:59 never considered themselves heroes.
00:05:02 Herman was one
00:05:04 of at least 132 Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:05:06 in the Netherlands
00:05:08 who died at the hands of the Nazi regime
00:05:10 for their belief in a better world
00:05:12 under the Kingdom of God.
00:05:15 All they had to do to be freed
00:05:17 was to renounce their faith or,
00:05:20 as in the case of Herman van Elburg,
00:05:22 simply provide names of fellow believers.
00:05:26 To love your brothers more than you love yourself
00:05:30 —that really meant something to him.
00:05:33 Down to this very day,
00:05:35 I pray every day that I may be just like them.

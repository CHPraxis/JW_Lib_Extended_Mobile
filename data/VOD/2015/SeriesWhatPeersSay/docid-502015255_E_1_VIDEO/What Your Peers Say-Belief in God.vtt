A lot of people say

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no intelligent person
would believe in God.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that’s just not true.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.171 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many professionals believe in God,

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including doctors, lawyers, teachers,
even many scientists.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see a car,
I ask myself, ‘Who built that?’

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes intelligent people to design a car.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, so many things
have to work just right

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the whole thing to run smoothly.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if a car needed someone to design it,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so did humans and so did the earth

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so did the universe.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like you’re walking on a beach;

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:00.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you see an empty glass bottle

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:01.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
sticking out of the sand.

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:02.875 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now glass,

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.835 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s made out of sand particles.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, honestly,
would an intelligent person believe

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the bottle assembled itself
from sand particles?

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not!

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Researchers are exploring design features

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of insects, fish, and other animals
to create new products, . . .

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . or improve products that already exist.

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a bird called the kingfisher.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its beak is shaped

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it can dive quickly
from air into water

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without losing too much speed.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:34.573 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So engineers have used

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:35.950 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the shape of this bird’s beak

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.702 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to design the nose of Japan’s bullet train.

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, it goes 10 percent faster

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while using 15 percent less energy.

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.043 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some airplanes navigate with the help

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.045 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of a computerized autopilot system

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.631 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that could fit in your hand.

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s nothing!

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The monarch butterfly has
a brain the size of a pinhead,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet it’s able to navigate from Canada

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the way to Mexico.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s more than 1,800 miles.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s amazing!

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans get credit for the designs
they’ve copied from nature.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who should get credit for the originals?

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter where we look in the natural world

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at birds, butterflies, fish—

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything gives evidence of a Creator.

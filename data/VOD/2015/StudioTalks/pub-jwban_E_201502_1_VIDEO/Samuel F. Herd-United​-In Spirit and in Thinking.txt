00:02 Unity—it is often so elusive
00:05 in political, religious, social,
00:08 racial, and financial circles.
00:10 We love the amazing unity  that we experience
00:13 as a global brotherhood.
00:15 No matter the country,  one’s background, or former beliefs,
00:19 it is amazing  that around the world
00:22 we have unity of thought.
00:25 Though speaking  hundreds of languages,
00:27 there is one singular sound,
00:30 or unified message,  that is being preached.
00:34 In fact,  Romans 10:17, 18 says:
00:40 “So faith follows the thing heard.
00:42 “In turn, what is heard
00:44 “is through the word about Christ.
00:47 “But I ask,  They did not fail to hear, did they?
00:50 “Why, in fact,  ‘into all the earth
00:53 “‘their sound went out,  and to the ends
00:56 of the inhabited earth  their message.’”
00:59 That is amazing!
01:01 Millions believing exactly the same
01:04 based on “the word about Christ.”
01:06 One singular sound goes out.
01:09 That is unity of belief.
01:13 Some may say: “Unity of belief?
01:16 You’re brainwashed.”
01:18 Well, we do agree that our thinking
01:21 has been washed clean
01:23 from the complicated doctrines
01:25 that have evolved  since Jesus walked the earth.
01:29 However, the unity of mind
01:32 results from a thorough study  of the Scriptures.
01:35 It is a matter  of learning God’s Word
01:39 and separating its teachings  out from the many doctrines
01:43 that have been introduced  by human thinking.
01:46 When a classroom  full of students
01:48 take a math course,  like algebra,
01:52 at the end of the class,  no one accuses them
01:55 of being brainwashed  when they all end up
01:59 united in their understanding.
02:01 They simply learned  the math accurately
02:04 and put it to use.
02:06 But it is one thing  to be united in thinking
02:10 and yet another  to be united in spirit
02:12 as a brotherhood.
02:14 Going back to a math class:
02:16 At the end of the course,  all are united in thought.
02:20 They learned algebra.
02:22 But that does not mean  they all like each other.
02:26 They may have petty rivalry
02:28 or outright prejudice
02:30 against some of their classmates.
02:33 When we learn the truth  from God’s Word,
02:35 we become united  not only in thinking
02:39 but also in spirit
02:41 with our brothers around the world.
02:43 Even if we had deep-seated prejudice  in our hearts
02:47 before studying  with Jehovah’s Witnesses,
02:49 it begins to melt away
02:52 when learning the truth.
02:54 Why is that?
02:57 You will notice as we read
03:00 in Ephesians chapter 4
03:02 that godly qualities are learned
03:04 and perceived.
03:06 The bad traits  we might have had before
03:09 have to be unlearned.
03:11 And Jehovah’s holy spirit helps
03:13 mold our personality
03:15 to match more closely
03:18 the beautiful qualities
03:20 mentioned here in Ephesians 4.
03:22 Starting with verse 1,
03:24 the apostle Paul says:
03:28 “Therefore I,
03:31 “the prisoner in the Lord,
03:33 “appeal to you to walk worthily
03:36 “of the calling  with which you were called,
03:38 “with all humility and mildness,
03:41 “[and] patience,  putting up with one another in love,
03:44 “earnestly endeavoring to maintain
03:46 “the oneness of the spirit  in the uniting bond of peace.
03:50 “One body there is,  and one spirit,
03:53 “just as you were called  to the one hope of your calling;
03:56 “one Lord,  one faith, one baptism;
04:00 “one God and Father of all,
04:03 “who is over all and through all
04:06 and in all.”
04:08 My, that is unity, isn’t it?
04:12 All of those fine qualities
04:14 reflect the personality of Jesus
04:17 —perfect.
04:19 He was unspoiled
04:21 by the ingrained hatred  and prejudices
04:24 that he  may have been exposed to.
04:27 So is it easy to curb
04:31 ingrained prejudices?
04:33 No.  It is not that easy.
04:36 It would be good if it was,  but it isn’t.
04:40 It is a process.
04:42 Sometimes we show  the right spirit
04:44 on the outside, but inside
04:47 we are still struggling  to cultivate
04:50 that true unity  deep in our heart.
04:54 Do we have a Bible example  that makes clear
04:57 that this is a process
04:59 that we must work  our way through?
05:01 Yes, there is one
05:03 in Galatians chapter 2.
05:06 Here, Cephas,  who was usually called Peter,
05:09 though Jewish by birth,  had to learn
05:12 from Jesus not to be partial.
05:14 For many years, he had accepted
05:17 non-Jewish fellow worshippers.
05:19 He associated with them.
05:21 He ate meals  together with them.
05:23 But was there still a residue
05:25 of prejudice within him?
05:27 It seemed so.
05:29 His reactions  may have even come as a surprise
05:32 to Peter himself.
05:34 Read Galatians chapter 2,
05:37 verses 11 through 14,
05:45 and it says:  “However, when Cephas
05:49 “came to Antioch,  I resisted him face-to-face,
05:53 “because he  was clearly in the wrong.
05:56 “For before certain men  from James arrived,
06:00 “he used to eat  with people of the nations;
06:02 “but when they arrived,
06:04 “he stopped doing this  and separated himself,
06:08 “fearing those  of the circumcised class.
06:11 “The rest of the Jews  also joined him
06:14 “in putting on this pretense,
06:16 “so that even Barnabas
06:18 “was led along with them  in their pretense.
06:22 “But when I saw  that they were not walking
06:25 “in step with the truth  of the good news,
06:28 “I said to Cephas  before them all:
06:30 “‘If you, though you are a Jew,
06:33 “‘live as the nations do  and not as Jews do,
06:36 “‘how can you compel  people of the nations
06:39 to live according to Jewish practice?’”
06:42 What happened to Peter?
06:44 Fear of man  caused his former traits
06:48 of prejudice to resurface.
06:50 And it was contagious,
06:52 affecting other Jewish men  around him.
06:55 In fact, the verse said:
06:57 “Even Barnabas  was led along with them.”
07:00 Barnabas was a very warmhearted,  generous person.
07:04 His name even means  “Son of Comfort.”
07:07 If Peter and Barnabas  could succumb
07:10 to this kind of behavior  based on their childhood training,
07:14 we need to be very careful.
07:18 For a period of time,
07:20 it may take  a conscious effort on our part
07:23 to maintain unity  with our brothers and sisters
07:26 of varying cultures or races.
07:29 Was Peter able
07:32 to fully eradicate
07:34 any residual form
07:36 of prejudice from his being?
07:38 It seems he was.
07:40 Turn now  to 1 Peter chapter 1.
07:44 About ten years  after he shunned
07:46 the non-Jewish Christians,
07:49 Peter was inspired  to write these words,
07:52 verse 22:
07:57 “Now that you  have purified yourselves
08:00 “by your obedience to the truth
08:02 “with unhypocritical brotherly affection
08:04 “as the result, love one another
08:07 intensely from the heart.”
08:11 Learning what is right  and then consistently doing what is right
08:15 is a process.
08:17 We learn the truth gradually.
08:19 We soon have unity  of mind and thinking.
08:23 However, in time,  we purify ourselves.
08:27 How?
08:28 The verse said  by our “obedience to the truth.”
08:32 And did you notice that Peter says,
08:35 “with unhypocritical brotherly affection”?
08:39 Not the way he acted
08:41 ten years or so earlier.
08:43 He even said  to “love one another
08:46 intensely from the heart.”
08:49 Deep inside,
08:51 we would have love for all  in our brotherhood
08:54 without even a twinge  of prejudice.
08:57 Please turn back  to Ephesians chapter 4.
09:00 How does this process  of changing work?
09:04 Look at verse 17:
09:11 “So this is what I say
09:13 “and bear witness to  in the Lord,
09:16 “that you should no longer  go on walking
09:19 “just as the nations also walk,
09:22 in the futility of their minds.”
09:25 It makes clear  that we need to change
09:28 our thinking—our minds.
09:31 And what follows  this unity of thinking?
09:35 Verses 22-24:
09:39 “You were taught to put away  the old personality that conforms
09:42 “to your former course of conduct  and that is being corrupted
09:46 “according to its deceptive desires.
09:50 “And you should continue  to be made new
09:53 “in your dominant mental attitude,
09:56 “and should put on  the new personality
09:58 “that was created  according to God’s will
10:01 in true righteousness  and loyalty.”
10:05 Our very personality changes
10:07 because of our new  dominant mental attitude.
10:13 The beautiful thing  is that this process
10:16 is at work in millions
10:19 of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide.
10:22 And even though some of us
10:24 may still be working
10:27 on this kind of unity
10:29 deep inside,
10:31 this love already shows
10:33 on the outside as we mingle
10:36 with our brothers  from all over the world.
10:40 Psalm 133:1
10:42 says it right:
10:44 “How good and how pleasant
10:48 “it is for brothers  to dwell together
10:51 in unity!”

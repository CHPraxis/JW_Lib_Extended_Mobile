00:00:01 My comments to you today
00:00:03 are based on 2 Peter 1:19.
00:00:07 There it states:
00:00:09 “We have the prophetic word made more sure.”
00:00:12 Yes, we are fortified by the prophetic word.
00:00:17 Actually, there is no one on earth today
00:00:20 that is not affected by prophecy,
00:00:23 even if he is not aware of it.
00:00:25 What is a prophecy?
00:00:27 The Hebrew term for prophecy is not limited
00:00:30 to predicting or foretelling something in the future.
00:00:34 It also includes divine commands
00:00:37 or inspired instruction.
00:00:39 The Samaritan woman at the well
00:00:42 recognized Jesus as a prophet
00:00:45 because he revealed, not future things,
00:00:48 but things about her past
00:00:50 that he could not have known except by divine power.
00:00:53 The source of all true prophecy is Jehovah God.
00:00:58 At 2 Peter 1:21
00:01:02 it is said of prophecy
00:01:04 that “men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.”
00:01:10 In addition to transmitting prophecy by holy spirit,
00:01:14 Jehovah occasionally communicated
00:01:17 such messages by means of angels.
00:01:20 One outstanding prophet was Daniel.
00:01:24 In about 536 before our Common Era,
00:01:28 Daniel recorded a vision
00:01:30 involving world powers having interaction with God’s servants.
00:01:36 Turn with me to Daniel 8:21, 22.
00:01:42 Daniel’s vision was of animals representing governments.
00:01:47 Note this remarkable prophecy
00:01:49 at Daniel 8:21, 22:
00:01:56 “The hairy male goat stands for the king of Greece;
00:02:00 “and the great horn that was between its eyes
00:02:03 “stands for the first king.
00:02:05 “As for the horn that was broken,
00:02:08 “so that four stood up instead of it,
00:02:10 “there are four kingdoms from his nation
00:02:13 that will stand up, but not with his power.”
00:02:18 Interestingly, the Bible specifically named Greece.
00:02:22 The ruler under which Greece
00:02:24 became a world power in relation to God’s people,
00:02:27 like a great horn,
00:02:30 was the Macedonian Alexander the Great.
00:02:33 Alexander’s rulership was short-lived.
00:02:35 He died young
00:02:37 in the year 323 before our Common Era
00:02:41 —two hundred thirteen years after Daniel wrote his book.
00:02:46 Jehovah’s angel had told Daniel
00:02:49 that there would be four kingdoms
00:02:51 from his nation that will stand up in place of the Grecian empire.
00:02:56 And chapter 11, verse 4, specifically states
00:03:00 that the four regions would not go to his descendants.
00:03:04 Do the historical facts support these prophecies?
00:03:09 Yes.
00:03:10 Alexander’s two sons, from different women,
00:03:13 Heracles and Alexander IV,
00:03:16 both were killed before they reached adulthood.
00:03:19 Isn’t it astounding how precisely the prophecy came true
00:03:24 that the rulership would not be passed on to Alexander’s posterity?
00:03:30 But the prophecy also foretold that Alexander’s empire
00:03:34 would be divided up into four kingdoms.
00:03:37 Did that happen?
00:03:39 Yes!
00:03:41 One source listed
72 different military leaders
00:03:45 under Alexander the Great,
00:03:47 but the prophecy said only four
00:03:50 would eventually rule in his place.
00:03:53 After Alexander’s death,
00:03:55 there were constant fierce battles between these military leaders.
00:03:59 But finally, just four dynasties resulted
00:04:03 —just as the Bible prophesied.
00:04:06 One was that of General Cassander,
00:04:09 son of Antipater, in Macedonia and Greece.
00:04:13 The second was that of General Lysimachus
00:04:17 in Asia Minor and European Thrace.
00:04:21 Third was the one of General Seleucus Nicator,
00:04:26 the conqueror who secured
00:04:28 Babylon, Media, Syria, Persia,
00:04:31 and the provinces eastward into the Indus River.
00:04:36 And finally, the fourth was that
00:04:38 of General Ptolemy Soter, son of Lagus,
00:04:41 who secured Egypt, Libya, Arabia,
00:04:45 Palestine, and Celesyria [Coele-Syria].
00:04:48 These four proclaimed themselves king
00:04:50 around 305 before our Common Era,
00:04:53 18 years after the death of Alexander.
00:04:57 The prophecy was so detailed,
00:05:00 its fulfillment is fascinating proof
00:05:03 of divine inspiration.
00:05:06 Does this not strengthen your faith and trust in the Bible?
00:05:12 Here’s another point: What is the first prophecy in the Bible?
00:05:17 The first prophecy ever was the one uttered
00:05:21 by Jehovah at Genesis 3:15.
00:05:25 It foretold that the offspring of his figurative wife,
00:05:29 the heavenly part of his organization,
00:05:32 would crush Satan and his offspring,
00:05:35 bringing liberation to mankind.
00:05:38 To identify this offspring, primarily Christ Jesus,
00:05:43 Jehovah arranged for many prophecies pointing to him.
00:05:47 Revelation 19:10 says:
00:05:51 “The witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy,”
00:05:56 or literally ‘is the spirit of prophecy.’
00:05:59 What does that mean?
00:06:02 That all inspired Messianic messages from God,
00:06:05 proclaimed by his servants pointed to his Son.
00:06:10 At Luke 24:44 Jesus himself said
00:06:14 that all the prophecies concerning the Messiah
00:06:17 must be fulfilled.
00:06:21 Let’s consider some outstanding prophecies
00:06:24 about Jesus and their fulfillment.
00:06:27 One was that he would be born
00:06:30 of the tribe of Judah,
00:06:32 from the family of David, the son of Jesse.
00:06:36 More than 700 years before Jesus was born,
00:06:40 Micah foretold in chapter 5
00:06:42 that he would be born in Bethlehem.
00:06:45 The prophecy speaks of “Bethlehem Ephrathah.”
00:06:49 Why is the designation “Ephrathah” important?
00:06:53 Because there existed another Bethlehem
00:06:56 in the territory of Zebulun.
00:06:58 It has been identified with Beit Lahm
00:07:02 about 7 miles, or 11 kilometers,
00:07:04 west-northwest of Nazareth.
00:07:07 Again, the prophecy was extremely specific.
00:07:11 And amazingly,
00:07:13 Isaiah prophesied he would be born of a virgin.
00:07:17 What human would ever think of such a thing?
00:07:21 Daniel chapter 9 foretold that the Messiah
00:07:24 would arrive 483 years after the command to rebuild Jerusalem.
00:07:31 This proved to be true in the year 29 of our Common Era
00:07:34 when Jesus was baptized.
00:07:37 Zechariah chapter 11 foretold that the Messiah
00:07:41 would be betrayed for “30 pieces of silver.”
00:07:44 Chapter 12 says that his body would be pierced.
00:07:49 It was foretold that the Messiah
00:07:52 would die a sacrificial death for our sins
00:07:55 and be buried in the tomb of a rich man.
00:07:58 Furthermore, prophecy proclaimed that he would be in the grave
00:08:02 for parts of three days and then be resurrected.
00:08:07 What about the argument
00:08:09 that Jesus deliberately arranged matters
00:08:12 so that the events in his life would fit all these prophecies?
00:08:16 What do you think?
00:08:18 Could Jesus have arranged to be born of the tribe of Judah,
00:08:22 in the town of David’s birth, Bethlehem?
00:08:25 His mother, Mary, lived in Nazareth.
00:08:28 Could he tell her, while in the womb,
00:08:31 ‘Please take me to Bethlehem
00:08:33 because the scriptures say I must be born there?’
00:08:37 Obviously, the very start of his life on earth
00:08:41 was beyond his control.
00:08:43 Furthermore, could Jesus have arranged
00:08:46 for the priests to pay Judas the 30 pieces of silver to betray him?
00:08:51 Could he have arranged that his enemies spit in his face?
00:08:56 that the Roman authorities sentence him to be nailed to a stake?
00:09:00 that the soldiers cast lots for his garments?
00:09:04 Or that, while piercing his side with a spear,
00:09:07 they not follow the custom of breaking any of his bones?
00:09:12 Could the prophecies, just mentioned,
00:09:15 have been fulfilled by mere chance?
00:09:18 One Bible scholar likened this process
00:09:21 to the assembling of a statue
00:09:23 made of individual pieces of marble.
00:09:26 Imagine that many men
00:09:28 who had never communicated with one another
00:09:31 each brought a piece of marble into a room.
00:09:34 If those pieces fit together to form a perfect statue,
00:09:39 you would logically conclude that there must have been
00:09:42 someone behind the scenes
00:09:44 who had drawn the specifications
00:09:46 and sent an assignment to each man.
00:09:49 Fitting together like the pieces of a statue,
00:09:53 every Messianic prophecy would provide
00:09:55 a vital piece of information about the Messiah.
00:10:01 What, then, would be the likelihood
00:10:04 of all the prophecies about the Messiah
00:10:06 being fulfilled by coincidence in one person?
00:10:12 In an interview, researcher Louis Lapides said:
00:10:16 “Someone did the math and figured out
00:10:19 “that the probability of just eight prophecies
00:10:22 “being fulfilled [by Jesus]
00:10:24 is one chance in one hundred million billion.”
00:10:29 To arrive at the figure mentioned by this scholar,
00:10:33 by addition rather than by multiplication,
00:10:36 you would have to write down one million
00:10:39 and then copy that figure a billion times.
00:10:44 Putting those odds in perspective, the scholar stated:
00:10:48 ‘If you took one hundred million billion silver dollars,
00:10:53 ‘they would cover the state of Texas in the United States
00:10:57 to a depth of 2 feet, or .6 meters.’
00:11:02 Texas has a land area
00:11:04 of 266,807 square miles,
00:11:08 or 690,000 square kilometers.
00:11:12 Imagine that huge area covered
00:11:15 in silver dollars up to a depth of 2 feet.
00:11:19 Now what ‘if you put a mark on just one
00:11:22 ‘of those silver dollars and then had a blindfolded person
00:11:26 ‘wander the whole state and bend down
00:11:29 ‘to pick up just one coin?
00:11:33 What would be the chance that he choose the only coin that had been marked?’
00:11:39 The scholar then stated that those
00:11:41 are “the same odds that anybody in history
00:11:45 could have fulfilled just eight of the [Messianic] prophecies.”
00:11:50 Yet, Jesus fulfilled not just eight
00:11:53 but many more Bible prophecies.
00:11:56 This is overwhelming proof of divine inspiration.
00:12:02 Second Corinthians 1:20 says:
00:12:05 ‘No matter how many the promises of God are,
00:12:08 they have become “yes” by means of Jesus.’
00:12:11 What does this mean for us?
00:12:14 It means that Jesus was actually
00:12:17 the promised Messiah who was sent by God.
00:12:20 As such, he taught the truth.
00:12:23 If we believe him and follow him,
00:12:26 then we too have the truth.
00:12:28 There’s no doubt
00:12:30 about the divine origin of Bible prophecies.
00:12:33 But Bible prophecies deal not only with past events,
00:12:38 some prophecies are having remarkable fulfillment
00:12:42 right now before our eyes!
00:12:45 This gives us strong assurance
00:12:47 that the few outstanding prophecies
00:12:50 about the end of this wicked system of things
00:12:52 and the Paradise on earth to come
00:12:55 will also be fulfilled in the near future
00:12:58 without any possibility of failure.
00:13:01 As true Christians, we are engaged in a prophetic work.
00:13:06 This is, not in the sense that we initiate new prophecies,
00:13:10 but in the sense that we proclaim prophecies
00:13:13 already written down in the Bible.
00:13:16 At Pentecost 33 of our Common Era
00:13:19 when holy spirit was poured out on 120 disciples,
00:13:23 both men and women,
00:13:25 Peter quoted the prophet Joel saying:
00:13:28 “‘In the last days,’ God says, ‘I will pour out
00:13:32 “‘some of my spirit on every sort of flesh,
00:13:35 and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.’”
00:13:38 What did the 120 disciples do at Pentecost?
00:13:43 There is no indication  that they foretold new events,
00:13:46 but Acts 2:11 says:
00:13:49 “We hear them speaking . . . about the magnificent things of God.”
00:13:54 This was called prophesying.
00:13:57 Today, too, whether brothers or sisters or children,
00:14:01 we share in a prophetic work,
00:14:03 speaking about “the magnificent things of God.”
00:14:07 We speak about what he has done,
00:14:09 what he is doing now,
00:14:11 and what he will do in the near future.
00:14:13 What a privilege!
00:14:15 Having seen many prophecies fulfilled,
00:14:18 we have the prophetic word made more sure.
00:14:22 And we are telling people about the prophetic word
00:14:26 in order to fortify their faith too.
00:14:28 Yes, we do it to help them to get to the road
00:14:32 to everlasting life and to develop
00:14:35 an intimate relationship with our great God, Jehovah.

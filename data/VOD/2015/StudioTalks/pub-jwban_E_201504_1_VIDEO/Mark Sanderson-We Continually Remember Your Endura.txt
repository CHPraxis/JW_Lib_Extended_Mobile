00:00 For a few moments,  I would like to speak to you on the theme
00:05 “We Continually Remember  Your Endurance.”
00:10 What is endurance?
00:13 The original language word
00:15 in the Greek Scriptures
00:17 has the sense  of standing one’s ground
00:20 and persevering,
00:22 remaining steadfast under trial.
00:26 But it means even more  than just toughing it out
00:30 under a difficult circumstance.
00:33 The Christian who endures  has genuine hope.
00:38 He or she is convinced
00:40 that as 2 Corinthians 4:17 puts it,
00:45 “the tribulation  is momentary and light”
00:50 compared with the reward,  which is everlasting.
00:55 To illustrate  the importance of endurance,
00:58 you see before me  a number of suitcases
01:02 —some are small,  some are large.
01:05 What we don’t know  is how heavy each one is.
01:10 That depends on what’s inside.
01:13 Some large suitcases  can be surprisingly light.
01:18 Some smaller ones  could be surprisingly heavy.
01:24 In a sense, this illustrates
01:27 what confronts each one of us
01:29 when we dedicate our life to Jehovah
01:32 and start out on the race for life.
01:35 At first, we may not know
01:38 what loads we’ll have to carry.
01:40 We may worry
01:42 about what  might seem to be big tests,
01:45 only to find  that they’re not as overwhelming
01:48 as we feared they would be.
01:50 On the other hand,
01:52 some loads that we thought  would be light,
01:55 perhaps getting along  with one another in love,
01:59 might be heavier to carry  than we anticipated.
02:03 Then there are unexpected tests  of our faith
02:08 —tests that could involve health problems,
02:10 financial anxieties,
02:13 family issues,  and personal disappointments.
02:16 All such situations  call for endurance.
02:22 The Governing Body wants  you dear brothers and sisters to know
02:26 that we love you  for your steadfast endurance.
02:31 Our feelings are well summarized  by Paul’s words
02:36 at 1 Thessalonians 1:2, 3.
02:41 There he wrote  to the faithful Christians:
02:45 “We always thank God  when we mention
02:49 “all of you in our prayers,  for we continually remember
02:53 “your faithful work,  your loving labor,
02:57 “and your endurance  because of your hope
03:01 “in our Lord Jesus Christ
03:03 in the presence  of our God and Father.”
03:07 How beautifully these words
03:10 convey our feelings about you!
03:13 We are greatly encouraged  and strengthened
03:17 by your faithfulness,  your integrity,
03:20 and your endurance.
03:23 No matter what type  of hardship you are facing,
03:26 two things are certain:
03:29 Jehovah knows  how heavy your load is,
03:33 and he can give you  the strength to carry it.
03:37 Think about that first statement:
03:40 Jehovah knows  how heavy your load is.
03:44 How do we know that?
03:46 Open your Bible
03:48 to Hebrews 6:10.
03:53 Here the apostle Paul,
03:55 himself a wonderful example  of endurance,
04:00 tells us what makes  our steadfast endurance worthwhile.
04:05 Hebrews 6:10 says:
04:08 “For God is not unrighteous
04:11 “so as to forget your work
04:14 “and the love  you showed for his name
04:17 “by ministering
04:19 and continuing  to minister to the holy ones.”
04:23 Imagine,
04:25 Jehovah  would consider it unrighteous
04:28 to take your endurance  for granted.
04:31 In fact,
04:33 Jehovah does more  than acknowledge your work;
04:37 he also helps you  to carry your load.
04:41 How do we know that?
04:43 Open your Bible
04:45 to Philippians 4:12, 13,
04:52 and notice here  what the apostle Paul,
04:56 this model of endurance,  tells us.
04:59 Now, just before we read it,
05:02 perhaps we may think of Paul
05:05 as being a newcomer  to the Christian faith,
05:08 and compared  to many others, he was.
05:12 But by the time  he wrote to the Philippians
05:14 in 60 or 61 C.E.,
05:18 Paul had encountered  many obstacles.
05:21 He had many heavy loads to carry.
05:24 Paul mentions a few of them  in these verses,
05:28 but then,  in the second half of verse 12,
05:32 notice what Paul writes:
05:34 “In everything  and in all circumstances
05:39 “I have learned the secret
05:41 “of both how to be full  and how to hunger,
05:46 both how to have an abundance  and how to do without.”
05:51 Now, notice what he says  in verse 13:
05:55 “For all things  I have the strength
05:59 through the one  who gives me power.”
06:03 What does this mean for us?
06:06 That whatever load  we have to carry as a Christian,
06:10 we are not doing it  with our own power.
06:14 Jehovah will help us carry it.
06:17 He will give us the needed strength.
06:20 Paul knew  that because he had experienced this
06:25 from Jehovah firsthand,
06:28 he had Jehovah’s help in his life.
06:31 How?
06:33 Well, consider what Paul faced  on his first missionary tour.
06:38 An exciting assignment  lay before Paul,
06:41 Barnabas,  and their traveling companions.
06:45 Would it be a light load,
06:48 full of only good experiences,
06:51 or would this assignment  involve challenges,
06:54 some perhaps heavier  than he anticipated?
06:58 Let’s find out.
07:00 One of Paul’s first stops  was Pisidian Antioch.
07:05 Here Paul and his companions  had great success.
07:09 In fact, the people  begged them to come back
07:12 on the next Sabbath  to tell them more.
07:16 That seems like a light load to carry,  doesn’t it?
07:20 But Paul’s return visit  did not go as smoothly
07:24 as he probably expected.
07:26 While some accepted the good news,
07:29 opposers stirred up the crowd
07:32 to the extent  that Paul and his companions
07:35 were thrown out of the city.
07:38 Paul’s next stop was Iconium,
07:41 about a 100-mile,
07:44 or 160-kilometer, trip from Antioch.
07:47 Paul couldn’t take a train,  a bus, or a taxi;
07:52 he had to travel on foot.
07:55 Did things go better for him  when he got to Iconium?
07:59 Would his preaching there  be a lighter load to carry
08:03 than it was in Antioch?
08:05 Well, some did accept his message,
08:08 but then opposers  stirred up opposition.
08:12 Before long,
08:14 Paul and his companions  had to flee again.
08:17 This time they walked 20 miles,
08:20 or about 30 kilometers, to Lystra.
08:24 At first, things went well there.
08:27 After Paul and Barnabas  were mistaken for gods,
08:31 they gave a skillful witness  to the people of Lystra
08:36 about their powerful Creator.
08:39 But then the opposers
08:41 from Antioch and Iconium  came after Paul.
08:45 Some of them hated Paul so much
08:49 they walked over 100 miles,
08:52 or 160 kilometers,  to attack him.
08:56 When they found him,  they stoned Paul
09:00 and dragged him out of the city,  leaving him for dead.
09:05 Did Paul think that this load  was getting too heavy to carry?
09:09 Did he cave in to discouragement
09:12 because opposers hated him
09:14 and even attacked him physically?
09:17 No.
09:19 Paul had endurance.
09:22 And a person who endures  never gives up hope,
09:26 even in the face of persecution.
09:28 So, what did Paul do?
09:32 He continued right on with preaching,
09:35 this time in Derbe.
09:37 Just imagine the effort  Paul had to exert
09:41 to walk the 60 miles,
09:43 or about 100 kilometers, to Derbe
09:46 the day after he  had almost been stoned to death.
09:50 However,  the trip was worth the effort
09:54 because while in Derbe,
09:56 Paul and his companions  made many disciples.
10:01 As you can see,  Paul had a heavy load to carry,
10:06 but he didn’t give up.
10:08 He continued preaching.
10:11 But then Paul did something more.
10:15 Open your Bible to Acts chapter 14.
10:20 Here we see something that proved Paul
10:23 to be a man of endurance.
10:26 At Acts 14:21 we read:
10:31 “After declaring the good news  to that city
10:35 “and making quite a few disciples,
10:37 “they returned to Lystra,
10:40 Iconium, and Antioch.”
10:43 Imagine, Paul and his companions
10:47 walked back to the very cities
10:49 where they had been viciously persecuted.
10:52 Why?
10:54 Verse 22 says:
10:57 “There they strengthened the disciples,
11:00 “encouraging them  to remain in the faith and saying:
11:04 “‘We must enter  into the Kingdom of God
11:08 through many tribulations.’”
11:12 At first,  that statement might seem strange.
11:16 How could Paul  encourage the disciples
11:19 by telling them that they  would have “many tribulations”?
11:22 That prospect would seem depressing,  not encouraging.
11:28 But look carefully at Paul’s words.
11:31 He didn’t simply say:
11:34 ‘We must endure many tribulations.’
11:37 He said: “We must enter
11:40 “into the Kingdom of God
11:42 through many tribulations.”
11:44 In other words,
11:46 Paul strengthened the disciples
11:49 by emphasizing the positive result
11:52 of endurance.
11:54 As Jesus said at Matthew 10:22:
11:59 “The one who has endured
12:01 to the end will be saved.”
12:04 What’s the lesson for us?
12:08 Endurance is not just a matter  of toughing it out
12:11 under a difficult situation.
12:14 Endurance means
12:16 keeping our hope bright in our mind.
12:19 It means being personally convinced
12:22 that as 2 Corinthians 4:17 says:
12:26 “The tribulation  is momentary and light,”
12:31 but the reward is everlasting.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always enjoyed my work

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the people I worked with.

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to balance work and meetings.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since I was baptized,

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always done my best to be there.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife is a great support,

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we work hard to teach our children.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been my greatest joy.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to make sure that they’re cared for.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believed that if I worked hard enough,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d always be able to provide for my family.

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my boss wanted more
than I was willing to give.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:16.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He insisted that I work Sundays
during my meeting.

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed this job.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I were worried.

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:29.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would happen if I lost it?

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was determined
to take a stand for my meetings.

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spoke to my boss and explained my decision,

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he refused to compromise.

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t think this was
how it was supposed to go.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would I support my family?

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul studied the Bible with me.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:08.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been close ever since.

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He invited me out,

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I guess he’d heard
about what happened.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:22.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He really listened
as I poured out my concerns.

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:27.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered if I should have just done
what my boss insisted.

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would have missed my meeting,

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still could have attended

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:35.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an evening meeting
at a different congregation.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My skills were limited,

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:44.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there just weren’t
that many jobs out there for me.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him I was seriously considering a job

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would involve a lot of travel.

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul read to me from Matthew 6:25-33:

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop being anxious about your lives

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as to what you will eat
or what you will drink,

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or about your bodies
as to what you will wear. . . .

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his righteousness,

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all these other things
will be added to you.”

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:23.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminded me
that as a newly baptized Witness,

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my prayers are much more readily received

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah was ready to respond.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged me
to include Jehovah in my decision.

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Patience is not easy for me,

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I decided to look to Jehovah
to provide the right job.

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:51.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every day I kept looking.

00:03:56.953 --> 00:04:00.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But work never came.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.209 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I never thought

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.047 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it would go on so long.

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:28.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I had to go
on unemployment insurance

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could get by.

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I was doing the right thing,

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:37.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t help feeling

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was letting my family down.

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:51.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night, I was reminded of Jesus’ words

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Matthew chapter 6:

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Observe intently the birds of heaven;

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they do not sow seed or reap

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:08.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or gather into storehouses,
yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:13.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you not worth more than they are?”

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:19.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I was still relying on myself

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:23.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not fully throwing my anxiety on Jehovah.

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My skills may be limited,
but Jehovah’s are not.

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept on looking,

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I used my extra time
to auxiliary pioneer.

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just what I needed.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, Jehovah opened the door

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blessed my patience
with a job that was nearby

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:48.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with good hours for my meetings.

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even had more time for the ministry
with my family.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not an easy experience,

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:58.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my faith in Jehovah
was stronger than ever.

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw him act in my behalf,

00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:06.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know that he really does care for me

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my family.

00:00:06 I’ve always enjoyed my work
00:00:08 and even the people I worked with.
00:00:28 It’s hard to balance work and meetings.
00:00:31 But since I was baptized,
00:00:34 I’ve always done my best to be there.
00:00:42 My wife is a great support,
00:00:46 and we work hard to teach our children.
00:00:49 They’ve been my greatest joy.
00:00:52 I want to make sure that they’re cared for.
00:00:57 I believed that if I worked hard enough,
00:01:00 I’d always be able to provide for my family.
00:01:06 But my boss wanted more than I was willing to give.
00:01:12 He insisted that I work Sundays during my meeting.
00:01:19 I needed this job.
00:01:22 My wife and I were worried.
00:01:25 What would happen if I lost it?
00:01:30 I was determined to take a stand for my meetings.
00:01:35 I spoke to my boss and explained my decision,
00:01:39 but he refused to compromise.
00:01:47 I was shocked.
00:01:52 I didn’t think this was how it was supposed to go.
00:01:57 How would I support my family?
00:02:03 Paul studied the Bible with me.
00:02:05 We’ve been close ever since.
00:02:08 He invited me out,
00:02:11 and I guess he’d heard about what happened.
00:02:17 He really listened as I poured out my concerns.
00:02:23 I wondered if I should have just done what my boss insisted.
00:02:27 I would have missed my meeting,
00:02:30 but I still could have attended
00:02:32 an evening meeting at a different congregation.
00:02:37 My skills were limited,
00:02:40 and there just weren’t that many jobs out there for me.
00:02:44 I told him I was seriously considering a job
00:02:47 that would involve a lot of travel.
00:02:54 Paul read to me from Matthew 6:25-33:
00:03:01 “Stop being anxious about your lives
00:03:03 “as to what you will eat or what you will drink,
00:03:06 “or about your bodies as to what you will wear. . . .
00:03:09 “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom
00:03:13 “and his righteousness,
00:03:15 and all these other things will be added to you.”
00:03:20 He reminded me that as a newly baptized Witness,
00:03:23 my prayers are much more readily received
00:03:27 and Jehovah was ready to respond.
00:03:31 He encouraged me to include Jehovah in my decision.
00:03:37 Patience is not easy for me,
00:03:40 but I decided to look to Jehovah to provide the right job.
00:03:48 So every day I kept looking.
00:03:56 But work never came.
00:04:18 I never thought
00:04:20 that it would go on so long.
00:04:24 Eventually, I had to go on unemployment insurance
00:04:28 so we could get by.
00:04:31 I knew that I was doing the right thing,
00:04:34 but I couldn’t help feeling
00:04:37 that I was letting my family down.
00:04:47 One night, I was reminded of Jesus’ words
00:04:51 in Matthew chapter 6:
00:04:56 “Observe intently the birds of heaven;
00:05:00 “they do not sow seed or reap
00:05:03 “or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
00:05:08 Are you not worth more than they are?”
00:05:15 I realized that I was still relying on myself
00:05:19 and not fully throwing my anxiety on Jehovah.
00:05:24 My skills may be limited, but Jehovah’s are not.
00:05:29 So I kept on looking,
00:05:32 but I used my extra time to auxiliary pioneer.
00:05:36 It was just what I needed.
00:05:39 Eventually, Jehovah opened the door
00:05:42 and blessed my patience with a job that was nearby
00:05:45 with good hours for my meetings.
00:05:48 I even had more time for the ministry with my family.
00:05:52 It was not an easy experience,
00:05:55 but my faith in Jehovah was stronger than ever.
00:05:58 I saw him act in my behalf,
00:06:02 and I know that he really does care for me
00:06:06 and my family.

They say that a healthy mind
lives in a healthy body.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I take good care of mine

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not a day without exercising.

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I do my best to stick
to a spiritual routine too.

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no, the meeting for field service!

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to get going.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, my name is Ryan.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad I could work
with Andrew this morning.

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always so well-prepared
for the ministry.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, I’m not so good
at starting conversations

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with people I don’t know.

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it’s great
to have Andrew on your team.

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s really good at that.

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:57.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once we’re done here,

00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:00.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m off into the woods for a long hike.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s, like, the only place
I can recharge my batteries.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew suggests that we first do
some of my return visits.

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m afraid I don’t have any

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sorry, Andrew, maybe next weekend.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like our meetings,

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wish I’d prepared better.

00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the study is over,
and again I couldn’t comment.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:39.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man, I need to be
at the cinema in ten minutes.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:44.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah!
Thanks, Edgar!

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:45.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My field service report.

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My group overseer always has to remind me.

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:54.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How come I always forget?

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew and I are good friends.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be honest,

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he seems to be
the only friend I’ve got in our congregation.

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last week,
he was appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not surprised at all.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He <i>is</i>  a great example,

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for me.

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:26.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wonder why I haven’t qualified
to be a ministerial servant?

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, Andrew is always busy
for the congregation

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—helping the friends,

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking care
of our older brothers and sisters.

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He really cares for them.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How come I never think of that?

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That evening

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Edgar and Martin,
the assistant group overseer, came over.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve noticed how hard I train
to stay in good shape physically.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:04.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But am I working as hard
to be in good shape spiritually?

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martin reminded me of 1 Timothy 3:1.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This statement is trustworthy:

00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is desirous of a fine work.”

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This principle applies to me,

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since an overseer qualifies
first as a ministerial servant.

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:28.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers asked me,

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How is the apostle Paul
an example to someone

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:33.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s ‘desirous of a fine work’?”

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul strengthened the friends
by giving encouraging talks.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed personal interest for the elderly,

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:46.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the fatherless boys,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had a good share in the ministry.

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were right.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:02.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having a good share in the ministry
gives so much happiness!

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Edgar commended me
for how I handled that last return visit.

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows,
maybe I will conduct a Bible study soon!

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t realize that we had
so many nice friends in our congregation!

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:21.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps I just didn’t give them
a chance in the past.

00:04:21.277 --> 00:04:24.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I had a spiritual routine before,

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:28.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was too distracted
by what <i>I</i>  wanted to do.

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:31.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is so much I can do for <i>others</i>.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:33.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With better preparation,

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel more comfortable giving comments.

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was able to stand-in

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a part during the midweek meeting.

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martin gave me some great advice afterwards.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul worked hard,

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave to others, and reached out.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following his example

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:56.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives me so much joy in life.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I realize
what it <i>really</i>  means to reach out.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all about being a spiritual man!

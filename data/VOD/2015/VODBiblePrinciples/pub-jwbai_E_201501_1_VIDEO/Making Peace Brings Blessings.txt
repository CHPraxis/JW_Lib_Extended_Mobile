00:05 There are times  when peace can be threatened.
00:12 I found that out firsthand.
00:26 We both said things  we wish we hadn’t.
00:33 I thought she was just  being too sensitive.
00:38 I couldn’t even concentrate  on the meeting.
00:57 I thought,  ‘Why is she overreacting?’
01:05 I felt like telling someone.
01:09 Maybe I should talk  to my friends.
01:38 I thought about calling a relative.
01:53 Or maybe I should just  go to the elders.
02:11 It was disturbing my sleep.
02:14 It was all I could think about.
02:38 The next day I volunteered  to work at a Kingdom Hall project.
02:49 But earlier that morning,
02:52 I read Matthew 5:23, 24,  where it says:
02:57 “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar
03:00 “and there you remember that your brother  has something against you,
03:04 “leave your gift there  in front of the altar, and go away.
03:07 “First make your peace  with your brother,
03:10 and then come back  and offer your gift.”
03:57 How could I make a sacrifice to Jehovah
04:01 when I’m not at peace  with my sister?
04:05 I had to ‘leave my gift’  and ‘first make peace.’
04:29 We really talked from the heart.
04:37 I didn’t want to lose my sister.
04:44 And she didn’t want to lose me.
05:00 It’s amazing how wonderful it feels when you make peace.
05:09 I am so happy!
05:14 I not only gained my sister back
05:20 but I gained a truer  and deeper friend.
05:30 My relationship  with the congregation is stronger,
05:35 and I feel closer to Jehovah.

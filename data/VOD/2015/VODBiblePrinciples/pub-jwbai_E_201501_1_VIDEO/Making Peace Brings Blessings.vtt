00:05.525 --> 00:08.000
There are times 
when peace can be threatened. 


00:12.908 --> 00:15.000
I found that out firsthand.


00:26.922 --> 00:29.000
We both said things 
we wish we hadn’t.


00:33.178 --> 00:38.600
I thought she was just 
being too sensitive. 


00:38.600 --> 00:41.000
I couldn’t even concentrate 
on the meeting.


00:57.368 --> 01:02.000
I thought, 
‘Why is she overreacting?’


01:05.835 --> 01:08.000
I felt like telling someone. 


01:09.340 --> 01:13.000
Maybe I should talk 
to my friends.


01:38.243 --> 01:41.000
I thought about calling a relative.


01:53.633 --> 01:57.000
Or maybe I should just 
go to the elders.


02:11.568 --> 02:14.321
It was disturbing my sleep. 


02:14.322 --> 02:17.000
It was all I could think about.


02:38.512 --> 02:42.000
The next day I volunteered 
to work at a Kingdom Hall project.


02:49.732 --> 02:52.819
But earlier that morning, 


02:52.818 --> 02:57.488
I read Matthew 5:23, 24, 
where it says: 


02:57.488 --> 03:00.491
“If, then, you are
bringing your gift to the altar 


03:00.492 --> 03:04.245
“and there you remember that your brother 
has something against you, 


03:04.245 --> 03:07.833
“leave your gift there 
in front of the altar, and go away. 


03:07.833 --> 03:10.418
“First make your peace 
with your brother, 


03:10.418 --> 03:14.000
and then come back 
and offer your gift.”


03:57.883 --> 04:01.886
How could I make
a sacrifice to Jehovah 


04:01.887 --> 04:05.932
when I’m not at peace 
with my sister? 


04:05.932 --> 04:10.000
I had to ‘leave my gift’ 
and ‘first make peace.’


04:29.288 --> 04:32.000
We really talked from the heart. 


04:37.422 --> 04:40.000
I didn’t want to lose my sister. 


04:44.847 --> 04:47.000
And she didn’t want to lose me.


05:00.195 --> 05:05.000
It’s amazing how wonderful
it feels when you make peace. 


05:09.955 --> 05:12.000
I am so happy! 


05:14.482 --> 05:17.000
I not only gained my sister back 


05:20.007 --> 05:24.000
but I gained a truer 
and deeper friend. 


05:30.933 --> 05:34.000
My relationship 
with the congregation is stronger, 


05:35.688 --> 06:01.361
and I feel closer to Jehovah.

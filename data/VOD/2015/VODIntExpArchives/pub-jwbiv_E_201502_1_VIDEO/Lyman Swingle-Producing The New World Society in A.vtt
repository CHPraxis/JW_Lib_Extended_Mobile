00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:02.485 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Think back for a moment

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:03.987 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on how Jehovah supported

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:06.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his organization in ancient times.

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One example is Bezalel.

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:11.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember him?

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah appointed him
to make furnishings for the tabernacle.

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:17.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s quite a responsibility.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what experience did Bezalel have?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His last job was making bricks in Egypt.

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:27.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it is possible
that he had some other skills,

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:31.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would he accomplish
something as grand as the tabernacle?

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus chapter 35 teaches us
that it was Jehovah

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gave Bezalel the wisdom

00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the understanding to do the work.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s earthly organization today
faces similar challenges.

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers who took the lead
in setting up our first printery

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:50.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had no prior experience,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:54.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the same applies to the brothers
who produced our very first video.

00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will enjoy this archive interview
with Brother Lyman Swingle,

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was part of that very first video team.

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Swingle was later appointed
as a member of the Governing Body

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until he finished his earthly course in 2001.

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The headquarters
of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:16.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a center of new world action.

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were given instructions,
“Well, why not make

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a film of world headquarters
and what we do here,

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show it in film.”

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I thought it was a great idea myself,

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was interested in photography.

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bethel” means the “House of God.”

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many people would like to visit here
but don’t have the opportunity?

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:43.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let them see what the New World Society
is in action

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, I think, a tour through this place

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will give them the concept
of the whole organization.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.062 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They appointed a team of three

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:54.330 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to write a script,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so they put this script together.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just across the East River
from all of this . . .

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a brother in Hollywood

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was connected with the film industry.

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:10.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was sort of an amateur photographer,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was around them all the time
and knew their techniques.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like many of the other things
that the Society does;

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t have professionals to do it.

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:23.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, most are brought in here, and they learn.

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe they have a brother
like this brother who came here

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knew some of the basics.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went over to New York
and rented the lights

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and much of the equipment that was necessary.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All he did was bring his camera here.

00:02:42.312 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At his desk, the Society’s president,
Brother Knorr . . .

00:02:45.648 --> 00:02:50.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought, well, it would be best
to start with the president’s office

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work down through copy

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:57.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—following the copy
through its various processes.

00:02:57.994 --> 00:03:00.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all work together for one purpose.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone does one thing,
and someone does something else.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some work in the Treasurer’s Office;

00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some have to be president;

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:11.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some have to be dishwashers
and serve food.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s like the organs in the body.

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said:

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The hand can’t say to the foot,
“I have no need of you.”’

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all need everyone.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:26.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is the publication
of the New World Society.

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:30.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has fed us through its pages,
and he will continue to do so.

00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:34.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After they shot it,
well, it had run longer,

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking longer than they expected.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It got into the time of the convention,
and the brother said, “Oh!”

00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:43.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Why don’t we take the convention
and put it on here too?

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we do it in color?”

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Color in those days was really something,

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that even gave the film
a much bigger boost

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since they’d been looking at black and white,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then suddenly they get
a burst of color for the convention.

00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:05.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had the trailer camp

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(where everybody camped out there)

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Yankee Stadium,
and all of that was shown in color.

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:15.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That really made
a real climax to that picture

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you weren’t used to seeing color
except in the big theaters.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the evening, the students told
of life at Gilead

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:27.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and entertained us with a pleasant program
of songs from their native lands.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were some very trying moments,

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:34.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wondering whether it was
ever going to be completed.

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:36.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because after we shot it

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:40.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the brother that shot it
was going to edit it too),

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something came up in his life,
and he couldn’t do it.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re stuck.
What are we going to do?

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:54.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then the decision was made:
“Well, let’s do it ourselves.

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have never done it before,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we will tackle it
and see what we can do.”

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got a lab over in New York,
and we made a deal with them:

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look, we’ll give you the business
to duplicate these

00:05:08.424 --> 00:05:11.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if you take somebody over there

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show them how to edit this thing.”

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for a few weeks, I went over there.

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like any project here, every job here.

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the average Bethelite when he comes in

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he doesn’t know anything
about running a press

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or washing dishes or anything else
—we teach him.

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was just another job.

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You learn how to do it.

00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:37.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing things, these.

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:40.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is Jehovah’s spirit
that makes them possible.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is his work, not man’s.

00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we filmed the original,
we started editing it.

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:50.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw there were some gaps in the film,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not smooth dissolves
from one department to another.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brother had gone away,

00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we rented

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a camera again and lights and so on.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we came back and did it all on our own
—the brothers here.

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:13.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We filled in some gaps so we could go

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:17.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one scene to another scene real smooth.

00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one of those scenes, it shows

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you get the paper from the docks
up to the pressroom.

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had a scene where they’re rolling
the paper off the truck

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right into the camera,

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the next scene shows

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a roll of paper being rolled onto the press.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made a nice transition

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the docks, where the paper comes in,
to the pressroom.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were some others like that
that we filled in later.

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:51.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a complement to Jehovah’s people,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting out something like that
back in those days.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It illustrates that you
don’t have to go off to college

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get a high education to do something

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if Jehovah’s spirit is upon it
and blesses the project.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people have benefited from it.

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It often, in my mind,
throws me back to what the brothers did

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they made
the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They too were amateurs at it.

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, my goodness, look at the final product!

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:27.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this one was really
the only film, I think, the Society made

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:30.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they planned out a script,
wrote the script,

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then followed through
on shooting it and editing it

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and producing it themselves.

00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the same way today.

00:07:38.808 --> 00:07:41.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Society undertakes something,

00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:46.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they strike out in open space
and start flying.

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:48.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never flew before,

00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe they have
a few crash landings along the way,

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they pick themselves up

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

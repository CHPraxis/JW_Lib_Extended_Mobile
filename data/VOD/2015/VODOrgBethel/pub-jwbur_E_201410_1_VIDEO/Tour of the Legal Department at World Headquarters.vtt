Today, over 600 Witnesses worldwide

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:09.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are imprisoned for remaining neutral
in world affairs.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:11.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Join us as we visit

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Legal Department at world headquarters.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They work tirelessly

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our brothers legally
and to protect our rights

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to publicly witness to others.

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch.

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In carrying out the responsibility
to do God’s will, 

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
have met with legal challenges.

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, children,
let’s stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These challenges have been many

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, at times, severe.

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no time to lose.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to get her into surgery right away,

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to prepare
for a blood transfusion.

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has led to the establishment
of a Legal Department, which is located 

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Watchtower Educational Center
in Patterson, New York.

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the direction of the Governing Body

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the United States Branch Committee,

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Legal Department works
to protect our legal rights to worship.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When restrictions are placed

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our activities, we work

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘defend and legally establish
the good news.’

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:23.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine a case
that was taken all the way

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the United States Supreme Court.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The town of Stratton, Ohio
passed an ordinance

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requiring that anyone wanting to engage 

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in door-to-door activity
had to obtain a permit from the mayor.

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ordinances that were enacted

00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:40.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were specifically designed

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to restrict the activity

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.353 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Witnesses tried to work

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:47.090 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the matter out with the municipality, 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the village,
but the village was insistent

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers and sisters obtain permits

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prior to going from door to door.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This permit scheme was upheld
in the lower courts in Ohio.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:03.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, the case was appealed
to the United States Supreme Court.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor and held

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that such ordinances are unconstitutional

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as applied to the public ministry
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even now, we still have some municipalities
that would like to enforce

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their permit regulation
against our brothers and sisters.

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We turn their attention
to the <i>Stratton</i>  decision,

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the issue is resolved.

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:30.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 1919,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
have obtained 50 victories

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:36.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the United States Supreme Court.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as extraordinary,

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have prevailed
in the European Court of Human Rights

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 50 times.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
do not seek confrontation.

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:53.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They prefer to quietly serve God.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.926 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But when events unfold

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that force them to stand up 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.631 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and say: ‘I won’t do this’

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or ‘I have to do that

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:06.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because my faith compels me to do so’

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.674 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—it is remarkable to see the steel-like 

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:15.044 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
determination of these individuals

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:17.480 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who have looked into the eyes of judges,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
magistrates, and police officers

00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have simply said: ‘I have to obey God.’

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What part can you play in ‘defending

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:29.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and legally establishing the good news’?

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can stay informed of legal developments

00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:34.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of reports provided

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can ask Jehovah in prayer to give 

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your brothers and sisters
“the power beyond what is normal”

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:44.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for his will to be done.

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also,

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can faithfully maintain your integrity

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:52.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah even when facing opposition.

00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:55.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thank you again for respecting my wishes.

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re very welcome.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are to Jehovah,

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has granted his people
the legal victories needed

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to freely carry out our worship!

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, folks, I know you have your ministry,
but when people call . . .

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the Legal Department’s privilege

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work “shoulder to shoulder” with you

00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ‘defending and legally establishing
the good news.’

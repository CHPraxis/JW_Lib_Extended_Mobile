00:00:01 Today, over 600 Witnesses worldwide
00:00:04 are imprisoned for remaining neutral in world affairs.
00:00:09 Join us as we visit
00:00:11 the Legal Department at world headquarters.
00:00:14 They work tirelessly
00:00:17 to help our brothers legally and to protect our rights
00:00:20 to publicly witness to others.
00:00:23 Please watch.
00:00:28 In carrying out the responsibility to do God’s will,
00:00:35 Jehovah’s Witnesses have met with legal challenges.
00:00:38 All right, children, let’s stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.
00:00:41 These challenges have been many
00:00:43 and, at times, severe.
00:00:48 There’s no time to lose.
00:00:50 We need to get her into surgery right away,
00:00:52 and we need to prepare for a blood transfusion.
00:00:53 This has led to the establishment of a Legal Department, which is located
00:00:58 at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson, New York.
00:01:01 Under the direction of the Governing Body
00:01:04 and the United States Branch Committee,
00:01:07 the Legal Department works to protect our legal rights to worship.
00:01:10 When restrictions are placed
00:01:12 on our activities, we work
00:01:14 to ‘defend and legally establish the good news.’
00:01:20 Let’s examine a case that was taken all the way
00:01:23 to the United States Supreme Court.
00:01:26 The town of Stratton, Ohio passed an ordinance
00:01:29 requiring that anyone wanting to engage
00:01:32 in door-to-door activity had to obtain a permit from the mayor.
00:01:35 The ordinances that were enacted
00:01:38 were specifically designed
00:01:40 to restrict the activity
00:01:41 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:43 The Witnesses tried to work
00:01:45 the matter out with the municipality,
00:01:47 with the village, but the village was insistent
00:01:50 that our brothers and sisters obtain permits
00:01:52 prior to going from door to door.
00:01:54 This permit scheme was upheld in the lower courts in Ohio.
00:01:58 Thus, the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
00:02:05 The Supreme Court ruled in our favor and held
00:02:10 that such ordinances are unconstitutional
00:02:12 as applied to the public ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:17 Even now, we still have some municipalities that would like to enforce
00:02:20 their permit regulation against our brothers and sisters.
00:02:23 We turn their attention to the Stratton  decision,
00:02:25 and the issue is resolved.
00:02:28 Since 1919,
00:02:30 Jehovah’s Witnesses have obtained 50 victories
00:02:34 before the United States Supreme Court.
00:02:38 Just as extraordinary,
00:02:40 we have prevailed in the European Court of Human Rights
00:02:43 over 50 times.
00:02:46 Jehovah’s Witnesses do not seek confrontation.
00:02:49 They prefer to quietly serve God.
00:02:53 But when events unfold
00:02:56 that force them to stand up
00:02:59 and say: ‘I won’t do this’
00:03:01 or ‘I have to do that
00:03:03 because my faith compels me to do so’
00:03:07 —it is remarkable to see the steel-like
00:03:11 determination of these individuals
00:03:15 who have looked into the eyes of judges,
00:03:17 magistrates, and police officers
00:03:19 and have simply said: ‘I have to obey God.’
00:03:23 What part can you play in ‘defending
00:03:26 and legally establishing the good news’?
00:03:29 You can stay informed of legal developments
00:03:31 by means of reports provided
00:03:34 by “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:03:36 You can ask Jehovah in prayer to give
00:03:39 your brothers and sisters “the power beyond what is normal”
00:03:41 and for his will to be done.
00:03:44 Also,
00:03:46 you can faithfully maintain your integrity
00:03:49 to Jehovah even when facing opposition.
00:03:52 And thank you again for respecting my wishes.
00:03:55 You’re very welcome.
00:03:56 How grateful we are to Jehovah,
00:03:58 who has granted his people the legal victories needed
00:04:01 to freely carry out our worship!
00:04:03 Hi, folks, I know you have your ministry, but when people call . . .
00:04:08 It is the Legal Department’s privilege
00:04:10 to work “shoulder to shoulder” with you
00:04:12 in ‘defending and legally establishing the good news.’

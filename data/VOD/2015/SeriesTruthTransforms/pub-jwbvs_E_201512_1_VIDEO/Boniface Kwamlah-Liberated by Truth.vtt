Our team met Brother Boniface Kwamlah
in the Volta Region of Ghana.

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:11.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From infancy, he was surrounded
by superstitious beliefs and practices.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he find that transformed his life

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caused him to take a courageous stand?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kwamlah had a desire to know God,

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as we saw, something was missing.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without help, how could he
‘incline his heart to discernment’?

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only when he received
the <i>Truth</i>  book as a young man

00:06:41.384 --> 00:06:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did he have spiritual food
to study God’s Word.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:49.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, he was able to understand
God’s sayings instead of false religion’s.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was baptized in 1976.

00:00:01 Our team met Brother Boniface Kwamlah in the Volta Region of Ghana.
00:00:06 From infancy, he was surrounded by superstitious beliefs and practices.
00:00:11 What did he find that transformed his life
00:00:14 and caused him to take a courageous stand?
00:06:27 Brother Kwamlah had a desire to know God,
00:06:30 but as we saw, something was missing.
00:06:33 Without help, how could he ‘incline his heart to discernment’?
00:06:38 Only when he received the Truth  book as a young man
00:06:41 did he have spiritual food to study God’s Word.
00:06:44 At last, he was able to understand God’s sayings instead of false religion’s.
00:06:49 He was baptized in 1976.

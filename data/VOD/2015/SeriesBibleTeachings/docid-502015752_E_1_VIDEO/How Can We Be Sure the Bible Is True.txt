00:00:03 Some accuse the Bible of being a collection of myths
00:00:07 and legends written by well-intentioned humans.
00:00:11 By contrast, the Bible says
00:00:14 that it is “the word of God,” “who cannot lie.”
00:00:20 If the Bible was authored by God,
00:00:23 it should be like no other book ever written.
00:00:29 For example, when it mentions scientific matters,
00:00:32 what it says should be in harmony with proved science.
00:00:37 When it foretells the future, its prophecies
00:00:40 should come true 100 percent of the time.
00:00:43 And if the Bible contains God’s message to mankind,
00:00:47 it should be available no matter where a person lives
00:00:50 and no matter what is done to stop its distribution.
00:00:54 Is the Bible full of myths, or is it accurate?
00:00:58 Consider just some of the evidence
00:01:01 indicating that the Bible is truly
00:01:03 an extraordinary and trustworthy book.
00:01:06 During the time when the Bible was written,
00:01:09 many people had mistaken ideas
00:01:12 about the shape of the earth.
00:01:15 A theory written after the Bible was completed
00:01:18 was that the universe emerged from a cosmic egg
00:01:22 and that the earth was supported by various creatures.
00:01:27 In contrast, about the year 1473 B.C.E.,
00:01:31 Moses wrote that the earth is suspended “upon nothing.”
00:01:36 And around the year 732 B.C.E.,
00:01:38 the prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth is a circle, or sphere.
00:01:43 These Bible writers contradicted ideas
00:01:46 that were popular at the time.
00:01:49 It was some 200 years after Isaiah’s day
00:01:52 that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras
00:01:54 may have proposed that the earth is a sphere.
00:01:57 And more than 3,000 years passed
00:02:00 from Moses’ writings until scientists such as Isaac Newton
00:02:04 realized that the earth seemed to hang upon nothing.
00:02:13 No human can foretell the future in exact detail.
00:02:18 Yet, about the year 732 B.C.E.,
00:02:21 the prophet Isaiah foretold that a man named Cyrus
00:02:24 would conquer the mighty city of Babylon,
00:02:27 that he would “dry up” a river,
00:02:29 and that he would enter the city through open gates.
00:02:34 History confirms that every detail
00:02:36 of this prophecy was fulfilled.
00:02:39 Concerning the same city, the prophet Jeremiah
00:02:42 foretold that Babylon would “become piles of stones”
00:02:46 and “never again be inhabited.”
00:02:48 Despite its strategic location, Babylon eventually became
00:02:51 a pile of stones and remains that way!
00:02:56 Throughout history, powerful men
00:02:59 have tried to stop the distribution or translation of the Bible.
00:03:06 They burned at the stake those who translated it
00:03:09 into common languages and persecuted those who read it.
00:03:14 The Bible has weathered the most  sustained attack of any book in history.
00:03:18 Yet, it has become the most widely translated and published book of all time.
00:03:23 Billions of copies have been produced
00:03:25 in some 2,700 languages.
00:03:29 The Bible is scientifically accurate,
00:03:31 contains reliable prophecy,
00:03:34 and is available to all mankind.
00:03:37 You have good reason to believe that it is inspired by Jehovah,
00:03:41 the God who cannot lie.
00:03:44 Still, you may ask: ‘Is the Bible still relevant today?
00:03:49 ‘Why are there so many different versions of the Bible?
00:03:54 What are the keys to understanding the Bible?’

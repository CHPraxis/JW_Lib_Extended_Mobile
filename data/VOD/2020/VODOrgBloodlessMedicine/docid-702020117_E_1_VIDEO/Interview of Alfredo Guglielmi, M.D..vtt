We have been working with
Jehovah’s Witnesses for 30 years now

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:27.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have progressively grown together
through this experience.

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have led us to be

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extremely cautious with the use of blood

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through good patient preparation,

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
careful selection of the patient,

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
careful management in the operating room

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the available
blood conservation methods,

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and correcting anemia prior to surgery.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has resulted—
And I have to say, of course,

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to a relationship that
has become stronger over the years,

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has resulted in a committee
within this hospital

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entrusted with limiting the use of blood

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for those who are not bound
by these restrictions.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it has been a beneficial process.

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has also led to a global reduction
in the use of blood,

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we know is harmful and can
lead to complications, such as those

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
associated with recovery,
as well as avoidable costs.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anemia is a factor,
we treat it beforehand

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the pharmaceutical means
we have available to correct it.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a committee in Verona
for the best use of blood

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that recommends all these procedures,

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we also apply to patients
who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a beneficial process
that your presence has allowed us to make.

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:56.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this type of preparation,
we can address

00:01:56.303 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even complex cases of pancreatic resection
and liver resections.

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:04.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do resections of liver tumors
and resections of pancreatic tumors.

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do these with reasonable
—reasonable—

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
risks and perform them safely.

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In gastrointestinal oncology,
we have come

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a rate of 50 percent
of patients transfused to 15 percent. 

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:28.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there has been
a notable reduction in the use of blood

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:30.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have, on the one hand,

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applied more careful surgical techniques and,

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the other, used all the tools
available to us for an efficient hemostasis.

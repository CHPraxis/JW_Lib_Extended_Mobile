00:00:02 When I started studying the Bible,
00:00:04 there were various factors that hindered my study.
00:00:07 I was a truck driver, and I was on the road a lot.
00:00:10 I had the worst kind of friendships,
00:00:13 and I smoked.
00:00:14 I smoked, on average, 60 cigarettes a day.
00:00:18 I realized that if I was going to make the needed adjustments,
00:00:21 I had to change my profession.
00:00:23 So I changed my job.
00:00:25 But if I wanted to get baptized, I had to stop smoking.
00:00:29 I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day.
00:00:34 One day, I bought a single cigarette.
00:00:38 I lit it, and I prayed to Jehovah.
00:00:40 I begged him to help me,
00:00:44 and he did help me
00:00:46 —so much so that I never smoked again.
00:00:48 And to this day, I don’t even have the urge to smoke.
00:00:53 Ten years after my first Bible study, I was baptized.
00:00:58 I’ve been serving Jehovah for 20 years now,
00:01:00 along with my wife and all my children.

Every year we organize

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 150 regional conventions
in our branch territory.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some convention locations
are 50 kilometers (30 miles) or more away

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the local congregations,
and the families are poor.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes families have to walk

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for two or more days
to reach the convention location.

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generally, the convention committee

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will request local elders to ask families

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:32.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who live in the town
where the convention is organized

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they can accommodate brothers
and sisters coming for the convention.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the problem is
that these families are poor too.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in their poverty,

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are willing
to give everything they have.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I host brothers who come for the convention.

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will sell one of my pigs or chickens,

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with that money
we can all have something to eat.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah is a generous God.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also want to show that love
for those who draw close to him.

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Philippians 4:12, 13 teaches me

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to focus on my own needs

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also on the needs of my brothers.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I take in guests
so that they can hear Jehovah’s teaching.

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives me a lot of joy.

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual food

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah provides for us
is helpful in this life

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the life we’ll have in the future.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I consider it
more important than physical food.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In reality, hospitality is not
about our material possessions;

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s about the heart.

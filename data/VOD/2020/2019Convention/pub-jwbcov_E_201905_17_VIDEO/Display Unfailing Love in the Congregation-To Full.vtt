Anita and I came here to Honduras

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as missionaries as single people.

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Anita came here one year before I did.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I graduated from Gilead in 1974.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so excited!

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the flight to Honduras,

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a feeling of loneliness
and anxiety overpowered me.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was sitting there all by myself.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought,
‘What if they forgot that I am coming

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:40.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nobody is there waiting for me
or they never got the information?’

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night
shortly after arriving in my assignment,

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suddenly my bed started to shake.

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought, ‘What on earth is going on?’

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no idea
because I had never experienced

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an earthquake before in my life.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I heard a voice:

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(that means in English)
“Joseph!

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on down quickly!”

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I came down,

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saw
my dear friends Ramon and Melody,

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who came
from their house to check on me.

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy to see them,
and I gave them a big bear hug.

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I almost cried because of their hospitality,

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friendship, and love for me.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I stepped down from the airplane,

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a group of people,
and I realized:

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are my brothers!
I am not alone.

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my new family,
and they are waiting for me.”

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty years have passed
since we arrived in Honduras.

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Anita and I realize
that the love and the hospitality

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the friendship
of the brothers has not changed.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate that very, very much.

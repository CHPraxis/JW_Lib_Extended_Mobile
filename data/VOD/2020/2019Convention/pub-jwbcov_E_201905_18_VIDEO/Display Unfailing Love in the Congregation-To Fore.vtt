The reason I immigrated here

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to earn more money and more freedom,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my life was only work and sleep.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I once thought,

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is not the reason I came here;

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is not the life I wanted.’

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what could I do?

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:25.504 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The life that I was pursuing

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:27.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not bring me true happiness.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband’s sister
started taking me along to the meetings.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters there

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:37.266 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were very welcoming to me.

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife started studying the Bible first.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw her becoming
happier and happier studying the Bible,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this motivated me to start studying
the Bible with her Bible teacher.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:53.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She lived far away,
but she was never late.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was like a mother

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:58.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cared for us like her children.

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our studies,
we were making huge progress.

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we didn’t expect
the huge challenge that lay ahead.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my youngest daughter was born,

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the doctor told us
she had congenital heart disease.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She needed immediate surgery.

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were facing this challenge,

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters
were right by our side

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continually assisting us,

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping us to find a doctor,

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and interpreting for us,

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we were not yet baptized.

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the day of the surgery,
a congregation elder and his wife

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drove to pick us up 
and brought us to the hospital.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also stayed by our side
until the surgery was done.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A couple came to the hospital
and brought us food.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sister helped
to care for my older daughter.

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really could feel
that the brothers and sisters

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really loved us, just like family.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I,
along with our two daughters,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are very happy to be worshipping Jehovah.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that the love shown to me
by the brothers and sisters

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was in imitation of Jehovah.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really helped me to see
that this is truly his organization.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the life
that we had been searching for.

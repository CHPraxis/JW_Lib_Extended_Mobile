Take care. Oh.
Bye, kids!

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye, Dad!

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love you.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad?
Dad?

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hello, Son.

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we still doing service tonight?

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, I’m just too tired today, Teddy.

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:13.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just don’t have it in me.

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll do it another day, OK?

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, OK then.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:43.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Dad, I thought we
weren’t going out in the ministry.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I prayed
for a little extra boost, Teddy.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re too tired . . .

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am tired.

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what?
I’m not too tired.

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:01.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Teddy.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice to see you, Brother Edwards.
Hi.

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Ian.

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re very welcome to go on there,
and it’s got other answers.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, I didn’t know
the Bible had answers to that.

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It answers many other questions
that you might have about the future.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:22.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I’d like to do
is give you an invite to our meeting.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:27.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Dad.
I really had a lot of fun tonight.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:27.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was great, wasn’t it?

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re home!

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to 1 John 5:3.

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it says:

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is what the love of God means,

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we observe his commandments;

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet his commandments
are not burdensome.”

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So are you ready for the ministry?

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yeah,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m a little bit nervous.

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:18.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get a little bit nervous too.
But if it helps, I’ll do the first door.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start off with this one then.

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:43.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing here?

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:44.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just asking our neighbors a question.

00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No. No. No.
You people and your questions—no one cares!

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:48.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t mean to disturb you.

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you did! You did disturb me!

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So get off my property
before I call the police!

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those Witnesses—what is their problem?
Every time!

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:57.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, Dad, he was really angry.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:03:58.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was, wasn’t he?

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I always try to remember

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:04.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that for years I used to react
exactly the same way.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know,
I learned the truth in my twenties.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in a violent family,
it also made me violent.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not interested!
Go away, and don’t come back!

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow.
So, what changed then?

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you see, one of my good friends died;

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that very same weekend,
the Witnesses came around.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, normally I would yell at them,
but this time I listened.

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the beauty of the truth
—anyone can change.

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is one reason
why we continue preaching.

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So shall we continue doing this door?

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:06.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi!

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to try some?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love to. Thank you.

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:10.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks!

00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mmm, that’s delicious!

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:14.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, they’ve just made it,
so there are fresh loaves on the counter.

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:19.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, but I couldn’t help noticing
your tattoo; does that have a meaning?

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes.
So these vines—they make a heart.

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:24.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of my boyfriend.

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re getting married in a few months.

00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:27.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, congratulations!
That’s great.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, me and my husband
have been married for about 11 years now.

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, wow!

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:34.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, I’m actually a little nervous;

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:36.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nearly all my married friends
are divorced now.

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, it’s completely understandable
that you’re nervous.

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:40.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a big step.

00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:42.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But have you ever wondered

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there is a secret to a good marriage?

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:45.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, no.

00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:47.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’ve got one, I’ll take it.

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:51.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, I’d love to show you what we found
helped us is a principle in the Bible.

00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:53.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad!
Mum witnessed.

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, wow!
That’s fantastic.

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:03.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know, I just couldn’t help myself.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s getting married in a couple of weeks.

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:05.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah?

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:09.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wasn’t interested in the Bible,
but, um, I left her one of our contact cards.

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:10.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you never know.

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:10.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She might end up on the website.
That’s really good.

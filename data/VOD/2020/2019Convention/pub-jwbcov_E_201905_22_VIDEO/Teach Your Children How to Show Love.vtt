We’re bringing dinner
to Brother Oh’s family tonight,

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I needed a few more things.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been so hard for them, you know.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t know how long 
she’ll be in the hospital.

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, Mom!
Can I get this, Mom?

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Honey.
No.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I, Mom?

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, put it back.

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want it. 
Please, Mom!

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
But only if you’re good, OK?

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, I want to go now.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, can we go?

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, Mom, Mom, I want to go.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please!

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll—I’ll let you go.

00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll talk later.

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:58.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.

00:00:58.245 --> 00:00:59.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to go, Mom.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:00.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Honey.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Mom.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I get this, Mom?

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:08.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry—one minute.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Honey, didn’t we already
get a snack for later?

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember 
what we came to get at the store?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so please put that back.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I’m done talking
to Sister Ju-Hee, we can go.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:24.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jehovah that we can play again soon.

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will make the Paradise, so we can
have fun every day and never be sick.

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be animals and lots of cats.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ji-Ho, hey!

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re leaving for the meeting soon.

We’ve got ten minutes.

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:21.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to go.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m—I’m sorry, what was that?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to go!

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:35.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah want you to do?

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know.

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he want it to be so boring?

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:42.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you should pay attention more, 
and it won’t be so boring.

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK?
Let’s go.

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ji-Ho!

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re in my house,
so you do what we all do, all right?

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tonight, we’re going to the meeting.

00:02:58.657 --> 00:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now come on.

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ji-Ho, hey!

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re leaving for the meeting soon.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got ten minutes.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on; let’s get ready.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to go.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ji-Ho, did you say that you don’t want to go?

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell me why?

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s boring.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, well, it is a lot of sitting.

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you haven’t always
felt this way, have you?

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:40.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what changed?

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your friends think it’s boring?

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What friends?

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see.

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ji-Ho, I want to hear more
about this tonight when we get home.

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s ask Jehovah for help, 
and then let’s get ready.

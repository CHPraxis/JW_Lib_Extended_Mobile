She said she had forgotten
about our invitation.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This wasn’t the first time.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does she do this again and again?

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said in my heart that I could

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forgive her.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you forgive her?

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hm.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course I will.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Christian usually knows
the right thing to do.

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But <i>doing </i>the right thing
—that’s different.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found what I needed.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I would forgive my sister,

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the article reminded me how to handle it.

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The three points were:

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Act promptly<b>.</b>

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t wait.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:55.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to talk with her as soon as I could.

00:01:55.552 --> 00:02:00.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) I shouldn’t talk to others about it.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must do it privately.

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And (3) act peacefully.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than accusing her,

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should simply express how I feel,

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also need
to listen patiently to my sister.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to act right away.

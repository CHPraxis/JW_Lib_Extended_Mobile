00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So are you going to talk
to any Career Day people?

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:14.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I don’t think so.

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I know you’ve got a part-time job
lined up, and you’re going to pioneer.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, so?

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the video-production people are here.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure they have part-time.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I still don’t know.

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, Dennis, you’re good at it.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, they do corporate videos
—nothing bad.

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on, just talk to them.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, I’ll check it out.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hear you.

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:53.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually you want
to work part-time to pursue other passions.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’d like to <i>start </i> part-time.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s doable,
but after you’re established.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a few years
of hard work and dedication,

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to pick your own jobs,

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll even get to set your own schedule.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, thanks so much for your time.

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One second, before you leave,

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just so you know,

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s what you can make in your first year.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My advice?

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try not to get
too caught up in the sacrifice.

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the payback.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Money.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:18.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No—wealth.

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 23:4, 5:

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop and show understanding.

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:36.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you cast your eyes on it,
it is not there,

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for it will surely sprout wings

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like an eagle and fly off into the sky.”

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, are you ready to go?

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, ready.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you talk to anybody?

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:11.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you learn anything good?

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, tell me.

00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:22.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not set your mind on lofty things,

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but be led along with the lowly things.”

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 12:16.

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, I have to go.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, bye.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:30.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love you.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Lena, do you still have your study
before the Chinese meeting?

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, yeah.
Vicky is picking me up after work.

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, have fun.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:38.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye, Honey, enjoy your study.

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.
Love you, bye.

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning, Lena.

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:57.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, good morning.

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sales team dropped
the ball and didn’t tell us

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the clients this morning speak Chinese.

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do this, right?

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perfect, thanks.
See you soon.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice job, Lena.
Well done.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:27.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so now let’s . . .

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wanted to see me?

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:37.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lena, come on in.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:42.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great job this morning.

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:44.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, really well done.

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:47.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what we saw in there confirms something
that we’ve been thinking about for a while.

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:50.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About what?

00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:53.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A TV network wants to do
a new reality series.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In each episode
we do a project for a customer.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want a cast from among
our designers and builders, 

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:02.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they need a young person to host.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:05.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lena, you’re our top pick.

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:07.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen, this can change your life.

00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:09.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to think it over,
but we need to know soon.

00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:10.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Lena.

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vanessa, where are we at with Main Street?

00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:27.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generation of Design
—premiering tonight at 8:30 central.

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:37.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generation of Design—all new season.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tonight at 8:30 central.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry it didn’t work out, Lena.

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to go with a new host this year.

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not set your mind on lofty things,

00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:53.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but be led along with the lowly things.”

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could sacrifice all these spiritual things,

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I still might not make it
in the business world.

00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:06.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even if it did work out,
I’d be worse off.

00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:10.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, I don’t want
to give up spiritual things.

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:12.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, where were we?

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:15.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lena, this sounds big, right?

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does.

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:19.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know this seems quick,

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my mind is already set
on some big things.

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:26.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thank you so much,
but I just can’t do both.

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:35.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey.

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey.

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:37.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready to go?

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:39.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, but where’s your car?

00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you serious?

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:43.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your car is busted again?

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need a new car, Man.

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can your parents drive us?

00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or . . .

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:48.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, they’re at a study right now.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can walk.
They’ll meet us there.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bakery is just down the street.

00:06:51.765 --> 00:06:53.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll pick something up for the Rudenkos.

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:54.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right.

00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:59.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, do you want some coffee?

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:00.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:01.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:02.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:06.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, could I have two coffees
and a box of tarts?

00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:11.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks so much.

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:12.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:13.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your coffees will be ready in a moment.

00:07:15.163 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just waiting on our drinks.

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:20.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, what are you so into?

00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:21.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bro!

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:22.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just released the entire season two.

00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:24.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s binge-watch this weekend.

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t watch that show anymore.

00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:29.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It started getting weird.

00:07:29.344 --> 00:07:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the heroes live together in that house
and date each other.

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right, but it’s about the action scenes.

00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not like it shows them having sex.

00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:41.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your order’s up!

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:42.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your coffees are ready.

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:43.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll get it.

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:54.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:55.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Man.

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:58.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Jake, about the show,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s a scripture
that helped me out—Romans 12:2.

00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:04.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:07.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That one says: “Stop being molded
by this system of things.”

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:09.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know I wouldn’t do those things.

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:12.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but it also says:

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:15.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be transformed by making your mind over.”

00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:19.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I honestly felt that that show

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:22.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was making my mind over
in the wrong direction.

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:25.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, but you’d still do what’s right.

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:29.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, but let’s say, for example,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re interested in someone,
let’s say, Vicky.

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:35.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe.

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:38.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, imagine the two of you start dating.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:44.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d find good ways
to get to know each other

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see each other in different situations.

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:55.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if your mind
isn’t fully made over to Jehovah’s way,

00:08:55.597 --> 00:08:57.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how far might you go?

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, I see your point.

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:13.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m still not convinced it’d trip me up.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but it’s worth thinking about.

00:09:48.984 --> 00:09:51.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw you looking at Dennis.

00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:53.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please—you and Jake were inseparable.

00:09:53.655 --> 00:09:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is cute and doing pretty good spiritually.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:09:59.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pretty good or really good?

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just say good.

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:03.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, it’s not like we’re dating;
it’s just observing.

00:10:03.748 --> 00:10:05.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s good to hear, girls.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re both still young.

00:10:08.837 --> 00:10:11.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can’t help but notice.

00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:13.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spirituality or the looks?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, what was the first thing
that you noticed about Dad?

00:10:20.098 --> 00:10:22.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, well . . .

00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:24.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I wasn’t the first one she noticed.

00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:25.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:10:25.187 --> 00:10:27.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you have to tell us.

00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:30.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:10:31.568 --> 00:10:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name was Tony,

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was definitely looks first.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:56.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:57.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cool off.

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:03.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then her parents said,
“You need to look deeper.”

00:11:03.308 --> 00:11:05.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they definitely gave me a lot to think about.

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:14.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse at Proverbs 31:30
had a big impact on me.

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:20.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Charm may be false,
and beauty may be fleeting,

00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:23.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the woman who fears
Jehovah will be praised.”

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I thought about that verse,
I realized it applied to me,

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:31.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also applied to Tony.

00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:35.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither of us was looking
for the person who feared Jehovah.

00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:39.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to think what my life
would be like married to somebody

00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:41.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who didn’t put spiritual things first.

00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really didn’t like what I saw.

00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:06.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided that it was best
to end things with Tony,

00:12:06.454 --> 00:12:08.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I started pioneering.

00:12:08.915 --> 00:12:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a year later at pioneer school,

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:13.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed someone else.

00:12:13.753 --> 00:12:15.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were hard to miss too.

00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:16.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:12:17.632 --> 00:12:19.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, it took time.

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:20.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did.

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:25.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really took until
we could see ourselves putting Jehovah first

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:27.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but together.

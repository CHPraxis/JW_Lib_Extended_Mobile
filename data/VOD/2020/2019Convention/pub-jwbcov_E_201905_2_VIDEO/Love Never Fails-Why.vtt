Welcome to the “Love Never Fails”!

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:08.571 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy
that you were able to arrange your affairs

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:16.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend all three days of this convention.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are sure that it will help you to get

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know our loving heavenly Father better,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draw closer to him,

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fortify you for the tests and challenges

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll face in the coming days.

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were the words
at 1 Corinthians 13:8 chosen

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because there is no other quality

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s more important to Jehovah than love.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is both the personification

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the very Source of love.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s his dominant quality.

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he does is motivated by love.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot properly think of Jehovah
without thinking of love.

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle John was inspired
to say that “God is love.”

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When John wrote that,
he used the same Greek word for love

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul used
at 1 Corinthians 13:8—<i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe. </i>

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, the Scriptures
use forms of the Greek word <i>phi·li</i><i>ʹ</i><i>a </i>

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when encouraging Christians
to have affection for one another.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus even used a form of this word

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when saying
that “the Father has affection for the Son

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shows him
all the things he himself does.”

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more frequently,
the Bible uses the word <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe </i>

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:43.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to indicate the love

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God
and Jesus Christ have for each other.

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As used in the Scriptures, 

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe </i>involves more
than an emotional response to another person.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:59.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This word often conveys
the meaning of love guided by principles,

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it includes devotion to righteousness

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sincere concern
for the lasting welfare of others.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe</i>
can even be shown to total strangers

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even enemies!

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To love people who don’t love us back,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love people we don’t even like,

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to love
those who persecute us is a victory,

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an achievement, a conquest

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over all
our natural inclinations and emotions.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It requires moral sense,

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:36.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an awareness of duty,
principle, and propriety.

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:40.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True Christians
are thus trained to show love on purpose,

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:42.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love at will.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such love is the crowning quality
of our Christian personality.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such unselfish love
is what moved Jehovah to create,

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:56.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s what moved him
to send his Son to die for our sins.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does the Governing Body
want all of us “to comprehend fully

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what is the breadth
and length and height and depth,

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know the love of the Christ”?

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This comprehension
and experience will help us

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:14.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to get a fuller appreciation

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:18.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the love Jehovah and Jesus have for us

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:22.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it will also equip us
to show love in more ways

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to a greater degree than ever before.

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such love will identify us
as the true disciples of Jesus,

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowing us to serve
as beacons of light in this dark world.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it will unite us with an unbreakable bond

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during what will be
one of the darkest times in human history

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the coalition of nations

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:48.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called Gog of Magog

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will attempt to annihilate God’s people.

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know 
that <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe </i>can do all of that?

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because at Colossians 3:14,

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are assured that <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe</i>

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a perfect bond of union.”

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That perfect bond
is so strong that we consider ourselves

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“under obligation to surrender
our lives for our brothers” if need be.

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, cultivating Christian love

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:23.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a matter of life and death.

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:28.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please pay rapt attention
to the talks and videos.

00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look up the scriptures
and read them along with the speakers,

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:37.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus allowing God’s Word
to exert its powerful force on your heart.

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may this convention
become a milestone in your development

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a humble imitator

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:46.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your incomparable and Grand Creator!

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:53.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the same desire that the apostle Paul

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed to the congregation
in Thessalonica,

00:04:56.984 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we find at 1 Thessalonians 3:12,

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also our heartfelt wish for you:

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:08.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May the Lord cause you to increase, yes, 

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:12.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to abound in love
for one another and for all,

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:14.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as we do for you.”

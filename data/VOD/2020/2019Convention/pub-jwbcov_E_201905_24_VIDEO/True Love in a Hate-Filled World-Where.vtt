I am full-blooded Cherokee.

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were Indians,
but yet we couldn’t be Indians

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the white man’s world.

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you’re telling me
I’ve got to go fight your war.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was drafted during the Vietnam era.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I got out,
I was very angry at the government.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard about this militant group of natives

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were fighting for their rights.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Protesting was a way of letting people know

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we were not going
to stand for this any longer.

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:53.365 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I grew up in Ireland in a family of ten.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were Catholic and very poor.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 16, I joined the army.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At school, we learned all about nationalism

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the 800 years of fighting
between the English and the Irish.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the conflict
started in Northern Ireland,

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had a tremendous effect on our lives.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:21.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw something happening

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saw foreign soldiers 

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
killing my people, fellow Catholics,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt I had to engage

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and defend them
against the British establishment.

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife started studying.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said: “They are coming here and are going
to Christianize us and civilize us,”

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Don’t bring those
Bible-toting white people around me.

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want their religion.”

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Nancy started studying,

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she decided to get baptized.

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the sisters said, “Are you
taking her to the assembly?”

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:19.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I told them; I said,
“Nah, I’m going to stay home.”

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the sisters, you know, said, 

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, who is going to watch the baby
while she’s getting baptized?”

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Oh, yeah, maybe I should go.”

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way they treated each other with respect

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one wasn’t on this side
and the other on this side.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were all together.

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t just walk by and ignore me.

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought people over
and introduced them to me.

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They spoke with sincerity.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought: ‘This is the way
the world should be.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the way people should live.’

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m currently serving as an elder

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:59.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Illinois River Cherokee Congregation
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:05.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have the privilege of teaching
these ones who have moved here

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:09.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn the Cherokee language
so that they can teach them the good news.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no other love—nowhere.

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:15.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This love is genuine.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in a car accident and nearly died.

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:27.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to drink
because I couldn’t cope with my situation.

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did expect that my comrades
in the Republican movement

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might have come to help us,
but they didn’t come at all.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was studying the Bible three weeks
with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very English,
and his wife, so English.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t have chosen them
to have come into my house,

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they did, and they were lovely.

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:01.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody came to see me—only the brother.

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:04.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would come regularly.

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that to me was a godsend

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that someone cared about me.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:14.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought: ‘Wow!

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone who is fighting
for justice in the world needn’t fight.’

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:18.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that went right through my heart.

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when I meet
ex-British soldiers in the truth,

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:43.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say to them,
“We’re in the same army now, brother.”

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:48.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only place we can find
love and friendship

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:51.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and companionship
is in Jehovah’s organization.

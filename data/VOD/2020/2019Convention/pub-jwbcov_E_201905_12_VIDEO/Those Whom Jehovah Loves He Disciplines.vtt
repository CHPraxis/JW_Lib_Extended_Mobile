I was raised in the truth

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:07.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had good spiritual examples in my family

00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:09.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped me to set goals at a young age.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I progressed to baptism in my teen years

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also started
regular pioneering as a teenager.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.164 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I started hanging around the wrong crowd

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:21.166 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(inside the congregation first

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then bad association outside)

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
partying, drinking heavily,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living a double life.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:33.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I couldn’t continue that
and stay at home

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because my parents
were still serving Jehovah faithfully,

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided to move out

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go into the world 100 percent
because I just wanted to have fun.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with nothing holding me back,

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the partying and the heavy drinking

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to experimenting with drugs
and living an immoral lifestyle.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lifestyle in the world
was pretty much to work all week

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:58.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to party on the weekend,
and that’s what we did.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I eventually saw that
that was just a vicious cycle.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, things got to the point where

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started having money problems—losing work.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my license at one point,
lost my apartment, couldn’t pay the rent.

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I knew this
was not the way to true happiness,

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was miserable.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought back to the time
when I was the happiest,

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s when I
was serving Jehovah full-time.

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I wanted that back.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I poured my heart out
to Jehovah in prayer,

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I let him know
that I wanted to return to him.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew from personal experience
that if you break a bone,

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as your arm, you need help;
you need to see a doctor.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only they are qualified to fix it
—set the bone right so it can heal.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I had to seek out the elders

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’re trained, spiritual doctors.

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They know how to use
the Scriptures to help you heal.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went to them
because I wanted to return to Jehovah.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even have dress clothes anymore;
I had lost all that.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just went back in jeans and a T-shirt.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents didn’t even know I was coming,
but I showed up at the meeting anyway.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders, when I met with them,
were so loving and kind and patient.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve learned firsthand
that Jehovah’s discipline is for the best.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it’s true; it may hurt;
it may sting initially.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:32.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we allow ourselves
to be molded and trained by it,

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’ll always work out for the best.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so glad that I made
the decision to return to Jehovah.

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed me

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:46.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the happiness
that I longed for and a lot more:

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:49.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
privileges of service
I never would have imagined.

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve experienced
through Jehovah’s discipline

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his greatest quality—love.

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve never been happier.

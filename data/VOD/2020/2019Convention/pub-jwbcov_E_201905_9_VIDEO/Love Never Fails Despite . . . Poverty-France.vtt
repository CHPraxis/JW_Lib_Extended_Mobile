My wife Elizabete and I
immigrated to Europe in 2006

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the economic situation
and civil war in Angola.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very poor in Angola.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had nothing to eat.

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we spent
several days starving, with nothing to eat.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite everything, we were happy.

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never had the desire to immigrate.

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d rather have stayed in Angola.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a big difference

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the African and European cultures.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we arrived in France,
we quickly saw the dangers we could face.

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was easier to have
a spiritual routine in Angola.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many things can distract us
from our spiritual routine today.

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not careful, modern technology
can draw us away from Jehovah.

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite our simple life,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we strive to be generous

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:17.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to teach our daughters
to be generous and hospitable.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do small things to help others.

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just want to show
our brothers how much we love them.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Relying on Jehovah for all our needs

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing love to our neighbors
is the most beautiful answer to poverty.

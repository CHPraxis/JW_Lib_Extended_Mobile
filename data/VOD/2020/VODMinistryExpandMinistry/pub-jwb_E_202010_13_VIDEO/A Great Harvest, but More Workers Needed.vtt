There are still many areas
here in Madagascar without any publishers.

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:10.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesusâ€™ command to his disciples
to go out and preach

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
definitely still applies in our territory.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to take part in fulfilling prophecy.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watching the broadcasts has also helped me.

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so glad I could have
a share in this work.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.837 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This time, we had so many publishers

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:26.088 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to take part

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had to add
more territories to preach in.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that in the future,

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one of these territories
will become a congregation.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journey was difficult
and painful at times,

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when we got there,
oh, we were so happy.

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being with 80 publishers,
all with different personalities,

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really helped me to make changes to myself
because we have to get along together.

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preaching to people of a different culture
was amazing,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing Jehovahâ€™s wonderful creation
made me so happy.

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last year, I made a lot of new friends.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this year, I got to know

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more people because my new friends
brought along their parents and others.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the brothers and sisters were so happy,

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing unity and love

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we all came
from different regions.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many householders were interested,

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we faced no opposition.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made many return visits

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started many Bible studies.

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the best and most enjoyable time

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have ever had in the ministry.

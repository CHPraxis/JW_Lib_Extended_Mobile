The shower is free!

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are sisters, we are brothers,

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sons and daughters, and more.”

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo!

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give me a truth.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, what?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your sign says “Learn Bible Truths,”

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I assume

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re here to share said truths.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:51.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So share one.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name’s Neeta.
What’s yours?

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade.

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the stone?

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like I’m jaded.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to share something,
or what?

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:08.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, yeah.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know the Bible says
you can live forever?

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heaven?

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that what you’re sharing?

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:16.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not exactly new, is it?

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says
that you can live forever on earth?

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why would I want that?
This place is a mess.

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it won’t be in the future.

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 21:4 promises:

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will wipe out

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every tear from their eyes,
and death will be no more,

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“neither will mourning
nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since there’s no death
or pain in heaven,

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where would this promise apply?

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:51.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know the Bible said that.

00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wicked!

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that’s cool.

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:03.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, OK.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to learn
how to be part of that future?

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah.
Uh, thanks.

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, I’m not really the churchy type, 
and I’m— I’m late.

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:15.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So see you later.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:43.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi again.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re really quite stealthy.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brilliant, right?

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s perfect when I’m late for class,

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is always.

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:03:56.757 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last week you spoke about promises,

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m not about church,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I am about promises.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well, if these are God’s promises,

00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:13.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t it make sense to go to his Word
to find out how to enjoy them?

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:14.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seems right.

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is John 17:3.

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:21.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to read it?

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:27.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, out loud?

00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:30.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?
Don’t you know what it says?

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do, but it’s nice to hear it again.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This means everlasting life,

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their coming to know you,
the only true God,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one
whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:50.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, based on this,
what means everlasting life?

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting to know God.

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:59.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you get to know something
you’re not even sure exists?

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:02.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to explore that answer
next time you come by?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who said anything about next time?

00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:07.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I’m just winding you up.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:10.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you later.

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do this.

00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a bit of a neat freak.

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:41.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t say.

00:05:41.486 --> 00:05:45.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last time we discussed
how God created us to live forever,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which raises the question,
Why do we die?

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Totally!

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:51.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Totally, what?

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:54.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like, I mean, I totally agree
that’s what we talked about.

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, right.

00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open to Romans 5:12.

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait, uh, why don’t I read it
out loud so we can both enjoy it?

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:13.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why, just as through one man

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:15.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sin entered into the world

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:17.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and death through sin,

00:06:17.606 --> 00:06:20.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and so death spread to all to men

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:24.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, hold it.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:25.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Adam the one man?

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This doesn’t make sense.

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:32.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said Adam was perfect
and wouldn’t die.

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:34.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:06:34.081 --> 00:06:37.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he sins and loses that.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:39.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s that got to do with me?

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:41.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I die because he’s stupid?

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:45.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe it’s not
how I would’ve put it.

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:49.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:53.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When parents
with a severe genetic defect

00:06:53.308 --> 00:06:55.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have children, what happens?

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:57.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually the kids inherit it.

00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:59.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Precisely.

00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:03.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Adam sinned,
that sin became like a genetic defect

00:07:03.568 --> 00:07:07.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that caused sickness, aging, and death;

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and since we’re all his children . . .

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:15.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, brilliant!

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get it!

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we watch a little video
that helps put it all together?

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:55.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta, your phone buzzed.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jade again.

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve only studied once this month.

00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so unscheduled.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought you said she was doing well?

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:11.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was.

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:14.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s just, “See you later.”

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:17.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was your last study?

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:21.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very interesting question,

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:25.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s not really what we are talking
about in this paragraph, is it?

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:29.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just read the scripture, shall we?

00:08:35.952 --> 00:08:40.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:44.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never even attempts
to explain why she cancels.

00:08:45.003 --> 00:08:46.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand.

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, I do.

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:52.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if she’s still open to studying,

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can’t let these little things
drain your enthusiasm.

00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:58.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:01.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just— I wish she was more structured.

00:09:01.978 --> 00:09:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like she doesn’t take
anything seriously.

00:09:05.816 --> 00:09:07.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No study is perfect.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s making some effort; focus on that.

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone’s enthusiasm
is contagious, it’s yours.

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I haven’t mentioned it already,

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:32.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love our chats,

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:34.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I appreciate all your questions.

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:36.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:38.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know sometimes they’re crazy.

00:09:38.473 --> 00:09:41.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you’re a deep thinker.

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:44.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good for both of us.

00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:51.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, um, yeah.

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:52.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, cool.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry I’m late.

00:10:13.758 --> 00:10:14.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s fine.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this mine?

00:10:17.804 --> 00:10:19.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My treat.

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:21.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, brilliant! Thanks.

00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:23.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have any breakfast.

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:27.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we left off at paragraph 10.

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:31.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen, I don’t have it in me today.

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:33.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got like two hours of sleep.

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you all right?

00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:41.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just super stressed—can’t focus.

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:45.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really sorry.

00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My boyfriend, school,

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:52.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work, everything else

00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:55.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I just don’t even have time to breathe.

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:58.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my schedule gets a bit crazy,

00:10:58.178 --> 00:11:01.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I focus on organizing what I can.

00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:03.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s that?

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:07.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I give everything a proper place.

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:10.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’m not really
the organization type.

00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:11.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can help,

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:15.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, if you want.

00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:18.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess a little help couldn’t hurt.

00:11:18.198 --> 00:11:22.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how organized
is your place right now?

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well,

00:11:28.124 --> 00:11:31.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with God all things are possible.”

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where shall we start?

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re the neat freak.
You tell me.

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:40.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find the bed;
we’ll work from there.

00:11:56.611 --> 00:12:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think any more
about what we talked about on Monday?

00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:02.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did.

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:06.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why would Jehovah
make a rule like that

00:12:06.454 --> 00:12:08.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no sex unless you’re married?

00:12:08.456 --> 00:12:09.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s totally archaic.

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:12.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might seem odd,

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:16.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what quality
do you most appreciate about Jehovah?

00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:18.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His love.

00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:20.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if he truly loves us,

00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:26.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48:17:

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:32.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:36.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[ <i>your</i>  God, Jade]

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One teaching you

00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:41.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to benefit yourself,

00:12:41.698 --> 00:12:43.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.”

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I don’t get it.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just— It just doesn’t make sense.

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:55.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Question:

00:12:56.796 --> 00:12:58.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does a little child

00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:00.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always understand why Mum and Dad

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:03.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
warn them not to do certain things?

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:05.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably not.

00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:08.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why all the rules and warnings?

00:13:09.643 --> 00:13:11.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they love them, don’t they?

00:13:13.813 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if Jehovah loves you . . . ?

00:13:21.988 --> 00:13:26.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It often takes time to appreciate
why Jehovah asks certain things of us.

00:13:28.578 --> 00:13:30.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we really love him,

00:13:31.414 --> 00:13:35.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have faith that what he asks

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is for the best.

00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:43.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The real question is,

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:46.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you trust him?

00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to;

00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:55.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really do.

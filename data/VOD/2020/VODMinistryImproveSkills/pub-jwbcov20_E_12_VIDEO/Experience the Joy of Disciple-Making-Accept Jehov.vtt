00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:03.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . making a friend with God.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t know how to do that.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a friend?

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve done fine with me.

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can see you—but God, a Friend?

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seriously?

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about what you can see?

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does creation teach us about him?

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, not much

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe evolve or your species dies.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t really help.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not talking about evolution.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m talking about the things
that God has created.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t suppose he’s got
a little workshop up there building things

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one at a time, do you?

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the real world, things evolve.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all random.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what that
tells me about him.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t ready for this.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evolution isn’t my strong suit.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be good:

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many who believe evolution . . . 

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:17.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ancient tidal pool . . . 
chemicals spontaneously assembled . . .”

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s too deep.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe: “What does the evidence reveal? . . .

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a cell to survive, . . . DNA . . .

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“RNA . . . inanimate chemicals . . .

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probability . . .”

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure this is what she needs.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her real issue

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was getting to know
someone that she can’t see.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s the best place to begin.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One widespread false teaching . . .

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“robs people of hope . . . implies

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:59.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that human life has no purpose . . .”

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be it; establish the positive:

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What creation really says about Jehovah

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
versus what evolution obscures.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you got me thinking, . . .

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I did some research, . . .

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Yeah.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:18.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I think
you’ll really like what I found.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, come, sit down.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, let’s do this.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve tried everything
to get Jade to a meeting . . .

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s every Thursday and Sunday,
and I think

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I think you’d really enjoy it.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t promise anything.

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be nice if you could come.

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might just text her,
actually, just to remind her.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, yeah, excellent.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried bringing
other people on the study?

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . well, maybe not everything.

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.
This is Abigay.

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:52.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.
Hi, Abigay.

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, let me kill that.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a long time since I hear them!

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:07.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that band?

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:08.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know them?

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:12.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to see them all the time
before I became a Witness.

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way!
You like that kind of music?

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t believe me?

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, this bag, it’s so big!

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t find anything.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abigay?

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, when I was young . . .

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:43.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were in a band?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The sun shines so sweet.”

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:50.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I love that song!

00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:51.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually have that vinyl.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:01.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll be gone next week.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:02.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ll have someone else
take care of the study, OK?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long would Jesus need to wait

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:43.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah would make him King?”

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:45.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, so “how do we know that Jesus

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not become King
when he was on earth

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:53.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or immediately after he was resurrected?”

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:58.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, because he didn’t.

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:03.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus
teach his disciples to pray?

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, yep—well, I know the obvious.

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:14.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your Kingdom come,”
implied future tense.

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:18.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we know for sure
what’s going on in heaven?

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:25.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it would help
if we reviewed the cited scriptures here.

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:31.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you leave, a suggestion:

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:35.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe if you were to study ahead of time?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really . . .

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:37.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about no.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:39.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really swamped.

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:41.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re busy; we all are.

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:43.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have no clue, do you?

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to go.

00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do next.

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:57.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought she
was making our study a priority,

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:01.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe she wasn’t.

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:08.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exams next week—it’s do or die time.

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:39.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I remembered 1 Corinthians 3:6

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:43.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that ‘God keeps making it grow.’

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:56.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked him to help Jade
and then left it with him.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I need to apologize.

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:26.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forget it, you were stressed.

00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:28.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but there’s more.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:31.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside I knew you were right;

00:08:31.323 --> 00:08:33.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just the last thing I wanted to hear.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, really.

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:41.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:44.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:45.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah?

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:53.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:54.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

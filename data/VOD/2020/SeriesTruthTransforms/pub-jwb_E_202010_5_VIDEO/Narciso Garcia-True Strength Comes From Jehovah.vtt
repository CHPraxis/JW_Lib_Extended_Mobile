00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sweated blood
to train myself in martial arts.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I joined a big competition,
I won the fight.

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life changed.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became the bodyguard
of a well-known politician

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taught martial arts
to some popular celebrities.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My students and my boss

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his family
—they all became part of my life.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was still looking for something.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, some Jehovah’s Witnesses
came by and gave me a tract.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was surprised

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really happy to learn God’s name.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘This could be
what I’ve been looking for.’

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I accepted a Bible study,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I realized that I owed everything to God.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I attended my first meeting,

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:50.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw how humble and caring
the Witnesses were.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my neighbors made fun of me.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:05.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to beat them because I knew I could.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was ashamed that I couldn’t do anything

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend Jehovah’s name.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one morning before going to the meeting,

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:23.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first time,

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:28.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I approached Jehovah in prayer,
asking him to give me courage.

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:31.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t do it alone.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:39.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that prayer,
I felt that Jehovah really strengthened me,

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I humbly told the neighbors

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was going to the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then,

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always prayed to Jehovah
when making decisions.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to leave martial arts.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to quit my job as a bodyguard
and stop carrying guns.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing his will wasn’t always easy,

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah gave me the courage to do so.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:30.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My boss asked me to visit him.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He offered me a new car

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and double my salary.

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His offer was very tempting.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went to the washroom and intensely

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayed again to Jehovah for courage.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:55.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, help me, please,” I said.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can’t do this on my own.”

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:07.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I chose Jehovah.

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:12.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is more precious to me
than anything this world could offer.

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him,

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sorry, but I am not accepting your offer.”

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like losing a family in death.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:30.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I got baptized.

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:37.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that it didn’t matter
what people thought about me.

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:41.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how Jehovah sees me that matters.

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am very grateful

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be with the brothers in serving Jehovah.

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am now serving as a regular pioneer.

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:57.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the life

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:58.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had been looking for.

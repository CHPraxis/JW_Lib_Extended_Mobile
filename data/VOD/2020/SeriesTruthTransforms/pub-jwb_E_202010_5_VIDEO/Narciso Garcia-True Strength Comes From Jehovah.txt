00:00:19 I sweated blood to train myself in martial arts.
00:00:25 So when I joined a big competition, I won the fight.
00:00:30 My life changed.
00:00:33 I became the bodyguard of a well-known politician
00:00:37 and taught martial arts to some popular celebrities.
00:00:43 My students and my boss
00:00:45 and his family —they all became part of my life.
00:00:54 But I was still looking for something.
00:01:06 One day, some Jehovah’s Witnesses came by and gave me a tract.
00:01:13 I was surprised
00:01:15 and really happy to learn God’s name.
00:01:19 I thought, ‘This could be what I’ve been looking for.’
00:01:25 So I accepted a Bible study,
00:01:27 and I realized that I owed everything to God.
00:01:43 When I attended my first meeting,
00:01:46 I saw how humble and caring the Witnesses were.
00:01:57 But my neighbors made fun of me.
00:02:01 I wanted to beat them because I knew I could.
00:02:11 I was ashamed that I couldn’t do anything
00:02:14 to defend Jehovah’s name.
00:02:17 Then one morning before going to the meeting,
00:02:21 for the first time,
00:02:23 I approached Jehovah in prayer, asking him to give me courage.
00:02:28 I couldn’t do it alone.
00:02:34 After that prayer, I felt that Jehovah really strengthened me,
00:02:39 and I humbly told the neighbors
00:02:42 that I was going to the Kingdom Hall.
00:02:48 Since then,
00:02:50 I’ve always prayed to Jehovah when making decisions.
00:02:55 I needed to leave martial arts.
00:02:57 I had to quit my job as a bodyguard and stop carrying guns.
00:03:14 Doing his will wasn’t always easy,
00:03:17 but Jehovah gave me the courage to do so.
00:03:27 My boss asked me to visit him.
00:03:30 He offered me a new car
00:03:32 and double my salary.
00:03:37 His offer was very tempting.
00:03:41 So I went to the washroom and intensely
00:03:44 prayed again to Jehovah for courage.
00:03:50 “Jehovah, help me, please,” I said.
00:03:55 “I can’t do this on my own.”
00:04:04 In the end, I chose Jehovah.
00:04:07 Jehovah is more precious to me than anything this world could offer.
00:04:13 I told him,
00:04:17 “Sorry, but I am not accepting your offer.”
00:04:22 It felt like losing a family in death.
00:04:28 Eventually, I got baptized.
00:04:32 I realized that it didn’t matter what people thought about me.
00:04:37 It’s how Jehovah sees me that matters.
00:04:41 Now I am very grateful
00:04:43 to be with the brothers in serving Jehovah.
00:04:48 I am now serving as a regular pioneer.
00:04:55 And this is the life
00:04:57 that I had been looking for.

00:00:02 I was born in Dalby, Queensland.
00:00:04 I’m the youngest of five children,
00:00:06 and my mother and father owned their own piggery.
00:00:09 So we lived on a little farm about ten minutes out of town.
00:00:13 When I was eight years old, my parents separated,
00:00:17 which came as a huge shock to me.
00:00:19 It was devastating, and the consequences just seemed to roll on for decades.
00:00:24 I would go and stay at the farm with my father for school holidays,
00:00:29 but my dad abused alcohol
00:00:32 and smoked cigarettes and used bad language.
00:00:36 So by the time I was a teenager,
00:00:38 I was doing exactly the same thing.
00:00:41 In my late teens, I was smoking marijuana every day
00:00:45 and I was spending up to four nights a week
00:00:47 at pubs and clubs and parties.
00:00:50 I was addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana,
00:00:55 and pornography, and I had no power to stop.
00:00:59 Obviously, it was only a matter of time
00:01:02 before that lifestyle affected my health.
00:01:06 I lost my social skills, and I became depressed.
00:01:12 The turning point in my life
00:01:14 came one afternoon when two
00:01:17 of Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on my door.
00:01:19 Because of feeling so lost and so unhappy,
00:01:23 I had started to search for answers and I’d begun looking
00:01:27 at New Age teachings.
00:01:30 The timing felt too remarkable to be just coincidence.
00:01:34 I really felt like God wanted me to take the book.
00:01:40 I never looked at New Age teachings again.
00:01:42 I started to read the Greatest Man  book instead.
00:01:47 A major key for me to be able to make the necessary changes
00:01:51 was to cut off bad association.
00:01:55 I was baptized in March 1994.
00:01:58 When I finally took that step,
00:02:00 I felt like I’d started on the right path.
00:02:04 I was so grateful that Jehovah
00:02:06 had found me and that he’d drawn me.
00:02:10 I really fell in love with the thoughts of Psalm 8:1, 3, 4:
00:02:14 “O Jehovah . . . ,
00:02:16 “when I see your heavens,
00:02:18 “the works of your fingers,
00:02:20 “the moon and the stars that you have prepared,
00:02:22 “what is mortal man that you keep him in mind,
00:02:25 and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”
00:02:28 I felt so insignificant,
00:02:31 and yet Jehovah knew me.
00:02:34 The hope of everlasting life also really touched my heart,
00:02:38 and so did Jehovah’s forgiveness.
00:02:41 I felt so grateful that Jehovah could forgive me
00:02:44 for all of my wrongdoing and that I could have a fresh start.
00:02:48 When we were invited to start circuit work,
00:02:52 I had serious doubts about my inadequacies.
00:02:56 I was not fast at preparing talks.
00:02:59 For me, it always felt like trying to fit
00:03:03 a square peg into a round hole.
00:03:05 But the very morning
00:03:07 after receiving our assignment to go in the circuit work full-time,
00:03:11 my Bible reading was Exodus chapters 3 and 4,
00:03:15 where Moses cited his inadequacies to Jehovah
00:03:19 —that he was not a fluent speaker.
00:03:21 Well, of course, Jehovah asked him,
00:03:23 ‘Who is it that assigns a mouth?’
00:03:26 It was like Jehovah was saying to me:
00:03:29 ‘Don’t worry. I will help you.’
00:03:32 To make the changes that I did in life,
00:03:35 I’m just so grateful to Jehovah.
00:03:38 Before I learned the truth, I was lost.
00:03:41 I didn’t know who I was.
00:03:43 I was just a mess.
00:03:45 I wanted to be a man,
00:03:47 but I didn’t really ever know how to do it.
00:03:50 Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.
00:03:54 Jehovah has given me everything.

Are you making full use of <i>JW Library®?</i>

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s learn how some are using it,

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then practice together.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I create notes in my Bible
for many different reasons.

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a good point from a talk,

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an illustration to help me
to explain something to a Bible student,

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something for my own meditation.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I highlight the key phrase
and create a note.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have <i>JW Library,</i>

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find 1 Timothy 2:6 in the Bible.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now highlight the word “ransom,”

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tap the “Add a note” button.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then type your comment.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tapping the note marker in the margin

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings your comment into view.

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve created a lot of notes.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I use tags to help me find them again.

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, whenever I hear a point
that I want to use in the ministry,

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I create a note and add a tag

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like “prayer,” “ransom,” or “last days.”

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when I’m in the ministry,
I can quickly find my note.

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the note you just created,

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tap the three dots

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:29.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then “Edit.”

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now tap the button “Add a tag,”

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter a tag name.

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case, type “ransom.”

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can add as many tags as you like.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find your notes again,

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to the Personal Study tab.

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:58.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can type in the Search box,

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you can just tap the tag.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I read the Bible chapters
for the midweek meeting,

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often come across verses
that I want to understand better.

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:09.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I check the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I use the points
I find in a comment at the meeting.

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you still at 1 Timothy chapter 2?

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tap on the number for verse 6,

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:29.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then tap the <i>Research Guide</i> button
on the menu.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you can read information
that explains this verse.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:40.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can even copy a portion
of the research and paste it into your note.

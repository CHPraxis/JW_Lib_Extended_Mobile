00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before our Lord Jesus returned to heaven,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave what has been called
the great commission.

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:18.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of people of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:22.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the Son and of the holy spirit.”

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:26.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you have those words
in your mind as well.

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:29.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was not satisfied

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people should just
come to know his teachings.

00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:36.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus wanted people
to come to love his teachings

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:41.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they would act on them,
so that they would live by them,

00:00:41.272 --> 00:00:45.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so that they would become
his true disciples.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:48.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why did Jesus want people

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:52.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become his disciples
and live by his teachings?

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:55.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because of something
that we read here

00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:58.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 13:17.

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:01.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what Jesus said here:

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:05.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you know these things,

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happy you are if you do them.”

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:15.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was saying that people
would find real happiness,

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:19.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would find the way of salvation,
they would have a relationship

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his precious heavenly Father
if they would just come to know

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:27.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do the things that he had taught.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,
in this symposium,

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:33.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are going to discuss
five different things

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:38.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our Bible students need to do,
that they need to progress in,

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:43.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are going to become
true disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:43.463 --> 00:01:45.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about the first.

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:50.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the most basic need
that our Bible students have?

00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:55.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s what Jesus talked about here
in Matthew chapter 5.

00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:57.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together.

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:01.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:3

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus said: “Happy are those conscious 

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:09.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of their [notice] spiritual need,

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:12.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the Kingdom
of the heavens belongs to them.”

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:14.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:18.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus showed
that honesthearted people

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:20.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a spiritual need.

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:25.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have a need to come to know God
and to have a relationship with him

00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:28.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are really going to be happy.

00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:31.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to teach

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:34.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible students the very first thing:

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:38.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they can fill that spiritual need

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:42.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning
about their heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:46.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they fill that need, as they come
to have that relationship with God,

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is the way to true happiness.

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means more than just
feeding people information.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, there is a saying
that’s very familiar to most of us.

00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:02.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says, “Give a man a fish,
feed him for a day;

00:03:02.464 --> 00:03:06.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teach him how to fish,
feed him for a lifetime.”

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:08.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:13.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we can teach our Bible students
how to feed themselves spiritually,

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:16.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then they have the way in front of them

00:03:16.353 --> 00:03:20.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a close relationship with God,
to strong faith,

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:24.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to becoming
real disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the following demonstration
that you’ll see on video,

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just notice how our Bible teacher

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps her student to be able to do this.

00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:51.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . just sum up the whole article.

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:55.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the answers in all that.

00:03:58.648 --> 00:04:00.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than just the answers.

00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:03.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m with it; I’m all about study.

00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you
remember more from our studies,

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:13.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answers or the things
that touch your heart?

00:04:14.874 --> 00:04:16.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm.

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:20.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, like,
when we talked about immorality,

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew the answer,

00:04:23.258 --> 00:04:27.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you didn’t seem totally convinced

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:29.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in here.

00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:33.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find that answer.

00:04:35.062 --> 00:04:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 6?

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:39.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:04:42.194 --> 00:04:46.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But whoever practices sexual immorality

00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:49.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure why,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it made me think of Mum and Dad

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:02.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(his constant cheating, actually),

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:05.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mum’s humiliation,

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divorce, all the misery.

00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:09.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want that.

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:19.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:22.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how right Jehovah is

00:05:22.028 --> 00:05:25.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what Neeta
called meditation.

00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about clearing your mind
to find inner peace;

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s totally different.

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:37.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s asking how Jehovah
feels about something

00:05:37.878 --> 00:05:40.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asking
what that means for me.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you notice in the video?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:54.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that Neeta showed
her Bible student the tools.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what more did she do?

00:05:56.857 --> 00:06:00.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also helped her
to see that the answers

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not the most important thing.

00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:06.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most important thing was having
the information come to touch her heart

00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:11.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she would be moved to act
on what she learned.

00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:13.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we help our students

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to feed themselves spiritually?

00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:20.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, from the very beginning,
once the study has been established,

00:06:20.674 --> 00:06:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to teach our students
how to prepare each week for the study.

00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:28.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this might be
something very new to them,

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’re going to have to go through it
step-by-step, showing them how to prepare.

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might also involve
having to help them see

00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:39.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they can buy out time
from their schedule

00:06:39.152 --> 00:06:43.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can do
what’s necessary to prepare.

00:06:43.323 --> 00:06:45.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then don’t forget to commend them.

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:49.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this might be
very new for many of our students,

00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:54.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they make the effort to prepare,
make sure you give appropriate commendation.

00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:56.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then what’s the next thing?

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is something that we
sometimes forget, brothers.

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:03.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the need to teach our students to pray

00:07:03.094 --> 00:07:06.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before every single study session.

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:08.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is this important?

00:07:08.308 --> 00:07:13.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, once again,
we want our students not just to be thinking

00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:15.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of acquiring information

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:19.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not to take
an academic approach to their study—

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:24.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead to be always thinking
about how what they’re studying

00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:28.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
connects them
with their heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:32.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they’re building up
a relationship with him.

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:34.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs chapter 2 says,

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we call out to Jehovah
for knowledge, for wisdom,

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:42.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for understanding,
Jehovah will help us.

00:07:42.177 --> 00:07:45.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help our student to gain
that knowledge that they need

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build up a good relationship with him.

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we want to do practical things.

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:54.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to help our students
to become familiar

00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the digital tools that we have
at our disposal for study.

00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:02.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means helping them
to install on their phone,

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:06.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their tablet, or whatever device
they have <i>JW Library</i>®

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing them how to use
<i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i> ™

00:08:10.707 --> 00:08:14.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can get the answers
that they need to their questions.

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:17.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know, as of February of this year,

00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:21.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i>
is now available

00:08:21.427 --> 00:08:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more than 700 languages?

00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:27.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So people virtually all over the world

00:08:27.892 --> 00:08:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have access to these wonderful tools.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t forget also to show them jw.org®

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:38.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and JW Broadcasting® and show them
how they can keep up-to-date

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these wonderful provisions from Jehovah.

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:46.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, we’ve shown them
how to prepare for their lesson,

00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:49.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve shown them
how to use the online tools,

00:08:49.123 --> 00:08:52.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what are the next progressive steps
we want to take

00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:55.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they
can feed themselves spiritually?

00:08:55.755 --> 00:08:59.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, as Psalm 1 tells us,

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we want to be truly happy
and truly well-fed spiritually,

00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:06.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to “read [God’s] law

00:09:06.767 --> 00:09:10.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an undertone day and night.”

00:09:10.187 --> 00:09:13.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want to teach our students
to get into that good habit

00:09:13.691 --> 00:09:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of reading God’s Word,
the Bible, every day.

00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what about the next step?

00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:22.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want our students also to be able

00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for congregation meetings.

00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:29.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we’ve shown them
how to use <i>JW Library,</i>

00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:31.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is really easy, isn’t it?

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:34.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we have to do
is basically hit that Meetings tab,

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:37.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we do,
well, all the information

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:42.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our midweek meeting
and our weekend meeting is all there for us.

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help our student to see

00:09:44.723 --> 00:09:47.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this program of spiritual feeding

00:09:47.893 --> 00:09:52.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is something they can access
and something they can benefit from.

00:09:52.482 --> 00:09:55.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about research questions?

00:09:55.318 --> 00:09:58.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers and sisters,
if you have a good student,

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:01.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re going to be
asking lots of questions.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is where it’s sometimes
difficult for us as teachers.

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:08.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would like to be able to just rush in,

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:12.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open our Bible, and answer
every question that our student has.

00:10:12.336 --> 00:10:14.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s the better course?

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:16.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we want to be modest.

00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of answering
all the questions for them,

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:24.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much better it is
to go back to those tools!

00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:29.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to <i>JW Library,</i>
go back to <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY,</i>

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:33.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show the student
how they can find the answers

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their own Bible questions.

00:10:35.861 --> 00:10:40.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we do that, we’re helping them
to build for the future.

00:10:40.533 --> 00:10:45.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers, if we can do this
—if we can accomplish this goal

00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:50.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of teaching our students
how to feed themselves spiritually

00:10:50.043 --> 00:10:52.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we are not just feeding them today.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:56.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not just
handing them a fish, as it were.

00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:59.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we’re teaching
them how to fish.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re teaching them
how to feed themselves

00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:04.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritually for a lifetime.

00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:07.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more important,

00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:10.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re fulfilling the commission
that Jesus gave us.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are making
real disciples of Christ Jesus,

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:17.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are well-fed spiritually.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as a result, they will not wither up
or they will not blow away,

00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:24.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead they will stand firm

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as true disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:32.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper with the Teaching Committee,

00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:35.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next talk in this symposium,

00:11:35.507 --> 00:11:38.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students
to . . . Attend Meetings.”

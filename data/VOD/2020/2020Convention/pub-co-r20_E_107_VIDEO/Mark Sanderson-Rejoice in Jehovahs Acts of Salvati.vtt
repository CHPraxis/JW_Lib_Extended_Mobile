00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the world, people everywhere
are looking for a savior.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They long for a savior
who can rescue them from disease,

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from hunger,
from poverty, from crime,

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from war,
even from death.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the midst of so many calamities
and so many problems,

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:26.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are Jehovah’s people rejoicing?

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:30.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our magnificent,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Almighty God,
Jehovah, is that Savior.

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:37.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have him and,
as a result,

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:39.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel joy in our hearts.

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:43.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures describe Jehovah
as being a “Grand Savior.”

00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know it is a part
of his personality, his identity,

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:53.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to want to rescue
and save his faithful servants.

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:57.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, knowing that Jehovah
wants to save us,

00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how should it
make us feel?

00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:04.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles and look
at this thought in the book of Psalms.

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 9:14

00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:15.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says: “So that I may declare
your praiseworthy deeds

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:19.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the gates of the daughter of Zion,
and rejoice

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:22.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your acts of salvation.”

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:27.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, how should we feel
about Jehovah’s ability to save us?

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:29.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his acts of salvation?

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:32.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the psalmist said
that we want to rejoice

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:35.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s ability to save.

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:38.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, brothers,
when we have faith,

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:43.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidence,
that Jehovah wants to save us,

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:48.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has the ability to save us,
and that he has ways

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and means to save us,

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:54.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this truly is
a reason for us to rejoice.

00:01:55.722 --> 00:02:00.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have that faith,
if we have that confidence,

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:03.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are going to be able
to face the future

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with real confidence,
knowing that whatever trial may come our way,

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have our Savior.

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:15.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, brothers,
to reassure us,

00:02:15.492 --> 00:02:19.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen our confidence,
that Jehovah really is our Savior,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps us to look to the past,
to Bible times,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah rescued
and saved his people

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both as a nation
and also as individuals.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:36.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s look rapidly
at three different examples

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:40.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Scriptures where Jehovah
saved his people as a nation.

00:02:40.976 --> 00:02:43.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the first one.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s from Exodus chapter 14.

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:48.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’ll remember here
that the nation of Israel

00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:52.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was right there at the Red Sea
with Pharaoh’s armies all around.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it looked hopeless,
but what did Jehovah do?

00:02:55.992 --> 00:03:00.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He opened up that Red Sea
right in front of his people

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowed them to walk
through on dry land.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a salvation that was!

00:03:07.712 --> 00:03:11.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, what about in the time
of Jehoshaphat, in the nation of Judah?

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:15.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when all those armies
of the opposing nations

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came and surrounded
them again?

00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, Jehoshaphat,
in 2 Chronicles chapter 20,

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:25.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looked to Jehovah and said:
‘Jehovah, we just don’t know what to do,

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:28.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our eyes are toward you.’

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jehovah do?

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:35.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“Take your position, stand still,

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see
the salvation of Jehovah.”

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what they did.
They went out.

00:03:40.204 --> 00:03:42.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took their position.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without them
having to fight at all,

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah threw
those other armies into confusion

00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they all
wiped each other out

00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the nation of Judah
having to do a thing.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saved his people.

00:03:54.718 --> 00:03:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a third example,
what about Hezekiah?

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we had
this amazing Bible drama

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:05.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several years ago at our regional convention
where we saw Hezekiah

00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:08.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look to Jehovah
for his salvation.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened?

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah sent
one angel who wiped out

00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
185,000 men in one night.

00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:18.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now,
what’s the point, brothers?

00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:21.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s obvious
from our review of the Scriptures

00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:25.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is a Savior

00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his people as a group,
as a nation.

00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:31.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen it over and over again
in the Scriptures.

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:34.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about as individuals?

00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, here’s a nice example

00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what the Bible says
here in Psalm 34.

00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:42.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it first
before we look at the example.

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:45.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Psalm 34:18.

00:04:48.774 --> 00:04:52.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 34:18

00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:56.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says: “Jehovah is close
to the brokenhearted;

00:04:56.615 --> 00:05:00.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He saves those
who are crushed in spirit.

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:03.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many are the hardships
of the righteous one,

00:05:03.497 --> 00:05:05.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[But what does it say here?
Notice, brothers]

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:10.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah rescues
him from them all.”

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what is it?
What’s the point?

00:05:12.464 --> 00:05:16.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah rescues
the righteous one,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just the righteous nation
but the righteous one.

00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:22.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s our example.

00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:25.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the faithful woman Hannah.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember her situation.

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah was barren.

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was constantly being harassed

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tormented
by her husband’s other wife Peninnah.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so she went to the temple,

00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:42.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she poured out
her heart to Jehovah.

00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you look at this with me?

00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:46.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 1 Samuel chapter 1,

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:50.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Samuel chapter 1,

00:05:55.508 --> 00:05:59.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see here
that in verse 10,

00:06:00.972 --> 00:06:04.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that “Hannah
was extremely bitter,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she began to pray to Jehovah
and to weep uncontrollably.”

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:13.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this faithful servant of God
just poured out her heart,

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begged Jehovah for his help,

00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:18.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had
a very specific request.

00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:23.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in verse 11,
she asked Jehovah for a child, a male child.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she told Jehovah
that if she would get this child,

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would dedicate him
to the service of God.

00:06:28.584 --> 00:06:31.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened?

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
look down here at verse 18.

00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:37.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once Hannah had expressed
this prayer to Jehovah,

00:06:37.134 --> 00:06:40.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in effect, she had just thrown
her burden onto him.

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what verse 18 says:

00:06:42.264 --> 00:06:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her face
was no longer downcast.”

00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:49.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do you remember at the beginning,
she was extremely bitter?

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it says her face
was no longer downcast.

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:53.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean?

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah was already
giving her the strength

00:06:57.613 --> 00:07:00.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able
to endure her situation.

00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:03.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it didn’t end there
because now look at verse 20:

00:07:03.286 --> 00:07:07.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Within a year,” it says,
“Hannah became pregnant.”

00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:11.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah gave her
the request of her heart.

00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, can you imagine
how Hannah must have felt?

00:07:15.548 --> 00:07:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look over at chapter 2
and verse 1, look what she says:

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:23.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My heart rejoices in Jehovah;

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:25.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my horn is exalted by Jehovah.

00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My mouth is opened wide
against my enemies,

00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:31.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for I rejoice

00:07:31.023 --> 00:07:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your acts of salvation.”

00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:38.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, obviously,
Hannah rejoiced

00:07:38.405 --> 00:07:41.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
had become her Savior

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:44.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she had experienced
his acts of salvation.

00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point, brothers?
What’s the point?

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:50.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as individuals,

00:07:50.042 --> 00:07:54.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can pray to Jehovah
with our specific distresses,

00:07:54.004 --> 00:07:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our specific requests
and concerns.

00:07:57.091 --> 00:08:00.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah honors
those who honor him.

00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know all of us
have experienced this when we feel

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:08.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
has heard our prayer,

00:08:08.102 --> 00:08:11.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has in some way
acted in our behalf.

00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:14.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s look
at another example.

00:08:14.484 --> 00:08:18.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it’s Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.

00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:21.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember
those three faithful Hebrews were there,

00:08:21.032 --> 00:08:24.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and King Nebuchadnezzar
had erected this golden image.

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:27.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said everyone
had to bow down to it,

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:30.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they would be thrown
into the fiery furnace.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego do?

00:08:35.088 --> 00:08:39.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They absolutely refused
to obey that order.

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:42.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to listen to Jehovah.

00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:46.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those men were tied up
just as Nebuchadnezzar had warned.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were tied up,
and they were thrown into that fiery furnace.

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:54.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, dear brothers,
I want you to think about this.

00:08:54.024 --> 00:08:56.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you imagine
this scene in your mind?

00:08:56.693 --> 00:08:59.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that as they
were going into the fiery furnace,

00:08:59.863 --> 00:09:04.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were all in a panic and they
were regretting their decision?

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:07.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, I’m so sorry that I
didn’t bow down to the image.’

00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:09.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not.

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:12.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at what these men said.

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:14.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Daniel chapter 3,

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:19.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 3,
and let’s look at verse 16 here:

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:26.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego answered the king:

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:30.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need
to answer you in this matter.

00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:33.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If it must be,
our God whom we serve

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘is able to rescue us
from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:39.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and to rescue us from your hand.

00:09:39.904 --> 00:09:43.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But even if he does not,

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:48.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘let it be known to you, O king,
that we will not serve your gods

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:52.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.’”

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, when you hear those words,

00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:58.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there any regret there?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any weakness?
Is there any panic?

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:04.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though
they were facing death,

00:10:04.388 --> 00:10:09.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego faced it with courage.

00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They faced it with resolve.

00:10:11.687 --> 00:10:14.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They faced it with dignity.

00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:19.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how they must have rejoiced
when after being rescued,

00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:22.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even Nebuchadnezzar himself
had to praise Jehovah

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the way he
had rescued his servants!

00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:29.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, brothers,
what’s the point of this review?

00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:31.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, in Bible times,

00:10:31.957 --> 00:10:35.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God
has saved his people

00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:37.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both as a nation
and as individuals.

00:10:37.713 --> 00:10:41.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Jehovah
delights to do this

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that it is
a cause for rejoicing

00:10:44.262 --> 00:10:48.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah’s servants
experience his salvation.

00:10:48.307 --> 00:10:51.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s the question.

00:10:51.978 --> 00:10:56.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know Jehovah delights
to rescue us, to save us.

00:10:56.107 --> 00:10:59.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know he’s moved
to do so by his loyal love.

00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it really mean?

00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:06.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean today
that when any sort of trial comes our way,

00:11:06.993 --> 00:11:09.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is just going to rush in?

00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s just going to intervene
and rescue us every time?

00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:16.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it does not.
It does not mean that.

00:11:16.419 --> 00:11:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why?

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah loves us
and has the power, why is it

00:11:21.216 --> 00:11:24.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he isn’t rescuing us
from every situation?

00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:28.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do you remember
what Satan said to Jehovah

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Job
in Job chapter 1?

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:34.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Satan said:
‘You’ve put a hedge around Job.

00:11:34.772 --> 00:11:36.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’ve blessed
everything he does.

00:11:36.815 --> 00:11:38.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You haven’t allowed any calamity
to come to him.

00:11:38.817 --> 00:11:42.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The only reason he serves you
is just because of selfish reasons.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He doesn’t really love you.

00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:47.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just worships you
for what he can get from you.’

00:11:47.243 --> 00:11:49.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, that same charge

00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:54.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be made about any of us
if Jehovah just rescued us from everything.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will Jehovah do?

00:11:57.044 --> 00:11:59.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we’re facing trials,

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s true
that in some circumstances,

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:04.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah may remove the trial

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:07.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in many other situations,

00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:09.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah may strengthen us

00:12:09.557 --> 00:12:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’ll be able
to endure the trial.

00:12:14.604 --> 00:12:19.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, when we feel,
when we experience,

00:12:19.692 --> 00:12:23.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is acting on our behalf,
how does it make us feel?

00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:27.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly, truly rejoice.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, brothers,
this is not theory.

00:12:29.536 --> 00:12:34.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This very week,
I lost my own father in death.

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:36.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father was 90 years old.

00:12:36.668 --> 00:12:40.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had served
Jehovah faithfully for 63 years.

00:12:40.964 --> 00:12:43.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers, this is a trial

00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:47.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that every single one of us
experience as God’s people.

00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some of you, like me,

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:54.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have experienced the death of a loved one
during this coronavirus pandemic.

00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:58.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you
that it’s not an easy situation.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we say?

00:13:01.026 --> 00:13:06.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can say myself
that we have felt the love of Jehovah

00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:09.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of the e-mails,
in all of the phone calls,

00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:12.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all the different ways
brothers and sisters have found

00:13:12.955 --> 00:13:15.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide the support
that we need.

00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s been true in my case.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s been true
for all of you who’ve had the same

00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:24.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or very similar experience
at this difficult time.

00:13:24.217 --> 00:13:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is giving us
what we need

00:13:27.303 --> 00:13:31.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can continue
to serve him faithfully.

00:13:31.057 --> 00:13:34.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when some big trial
comes your way,

00:13:34.894 --> 00:13:38.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask yourself: ‘Am I confident

00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:42.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that Jehovah’s loyal love
is going to move him

00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to act on my behalf?

00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:49.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Are his acts of salvation
going to be manifest for me

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:52.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I am going
to feel them myself?’

00:13:52.537 --> 00:13:55.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then,
does that confidence

00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:58.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is going to intervene,
that he is going to help us,

00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:01.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause us to rejoice
and be happy

00:14:01.963 --> 00:14:04.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the knowledge
that our God is with us?

00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:06.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now in the following video,

00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:09.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to take notice
of this beautiful experience

00:14:09.888 --> 00:14:11.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a dear sister

00:14:11.932 --> 00:14:15.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who did not have the trial
removed from her,

00:14:15.728 --> 00:14:20.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just notice how Jehovah
has strengthened her to be able to endure.

00:14:29.075 --> 00:14:33.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Malawi in 1962.

00:14:33.037 --> 00:14:37.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my eyesight at two years of age
because of an eye disease.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to rely on the rains
for the food we eat and sell,

00:14:43.172 --> 00:14:45.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it is our only source of income.

00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:49.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also look after both my parents.

00:14:49.804 --> 00:14:53.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father is 99 years old,

00:14:53.057 --> 00:14:56.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mother is 92 years old.

00:14:56.102 --> 00:14:59.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poverty is very time-consuming.

00:14:59.981 --> 00:15:04.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a lot of household chores to do

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep things clean and neat,

00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:10.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like fetching water for our daily needs.

00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:15.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the evening, after we have eaten,
this is the time for reading.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:19.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was young,
Father took the lead in our family worship,

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which he still does.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now because of his failing eyesight,

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:26.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read to them.

00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:28.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read with my fingers,

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so nighttime is no problem.

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:34.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My fingers are my eyes.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:37.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scripture that really touches my heart

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:40.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is James 5:11, which says:

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:41.690 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“We consider happy

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:45.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
those who have endured.”

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:47.279 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Job endured his trials,

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and at the end,

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:51.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw all the good that Jehovah
had blessed him with.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convinces me

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blessing us with all the things
that we are lacking,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling all his promises.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I’m happy to endure.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:10.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom and his sovereignty
are first in my life.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:15.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is only God’s Kingdom that will solve
all these problems.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:21.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel privileged that I’ve been able
to serve as a regular pioneer

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 36 years now and have been blessed

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:28.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help 64 persons to know Jehovah.

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:33.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy with song 76.

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t see myself as poor.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have the Bible and many 
different publications in Chichewa Braille.

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:53.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the congregation, the ministry,
and our brothers and sisters.

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:57.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these things make me very happy!

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not worried
about our current situation

00:17:00.855 --> 00:17:04.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are spiritually rich.

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t that amazing to see
that beautiful experience of our sister?

00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:28.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah
hasn’t taken away her trial.

00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:29.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s still blind.

00:17:29.968 --> 00:17:34.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She still has a very limited means,
but look how Jehovah has blessed her.

00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:37.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look how she’s able
to help so many people

00:17:37.475 --> 00:17:39.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to know
about Jehovah.

00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:41.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:43.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s look
at a second video.

00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:47.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re going to watch a video
where Jehovah really did step in

00:17:47.402 --> 00:17:50.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remove a trial from our dear brother
who was in a refugee camp.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:55.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the civil war,

00:17:55.202 --> 00:17:56.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to take refuge

00:17:56.703 --> 00:17:58.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a safer part of the country.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we arrived,

00:18:00.123 --> 00:18:03.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soldiers took us
to internment camps to hold us

00:18:03.544 --> 00:18:05.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they could confirm our identities.

00:18:05.546 --> 00:18:08.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the camps, we lived in tents,

00:18:08.298 --> 00:18:11.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was unbearably hot in them.

00:18:11.719 --> 00:18:15.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:18:15.097 --> 00:18:19.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to wait in a queue
for four to five hours every day.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the war, our eldest son was killed.

00:18:24.148 --> 00:18:26.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big loss for our family.

00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:31.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah

00:18:31.697 --> 00:18:34.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find comfort in the Bible.

00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:38.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, the brothers
from the relief committee came

00:18:38.663 --> 00:18:41.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and informed us
that a regional convention would be held.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had spoken to the camp officials,
requesting permission for us to go.

00:18:47.338 --> 00:18:49.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For four days, morning and evening,

00:18:49.966 --> 00:18:52.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we went to the officials
to ask for permission.

00:18:52.552 --> 00:18:56.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they would not tell us if we
would be released for the convention.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly one afternoon,
much to our surprise,

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were approved
to leave the camp for five days.

00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:06.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, we had been
in the internment camp for months.

00:19:06.733 --> 00:19:10.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had not been allowed to go anywhere.

00:19:10.028 --> 00:19:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so happy that we got the permission
to attend the convention.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never expected it!

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time, we had some clothes.

00:19:19.538 --> 00:19:22.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we had nothing
for the three-day convention.

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:27.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the brothers outside the camp
helped us enormously.

00:19:27.796 --> 00:19:30.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were with us
and cared for all our needs

00:19:30.883 --> 00:19:34.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could be ready for the convention.

00:19:35.387 --> 00:19:38.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still wondered
where we were going to stay

00:19:38.474 --> 00:19:40.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we would get
our accommodations.

00:19:42.144 --> 00:19:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when we arrived,

00:19:44.146 --> 00:19:46.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers hugged us
and warmly welcomed us.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really encouraged.

00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we faced
many challenges and difficulties

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the internment camp,

00:19:55.992 --> 00:19:58.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that convention
was like a nourishing meal for us.

00:19:58.453 --> 00:20:02.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real joy eating at Jehovah’s table.

00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:05.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can never forget those moments.

00:20:07.211 --> 00:20:10.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the convention,
a brother from the Governing Body

00:20:10.673 --> 00:20:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave a special talk to those
from the internment camps.

00:20:13.843 --> 00:20:16.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That talk really strengthened us.

00:20:18.223 --> 00:20:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The convention helped us to be courageous,

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:23.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after we returned to the camp.

00:20:23.436 --> 00:20:26.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we faced many losses,

00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:28.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the convention not only gave us comfort

00:20:28.525 --> 00:20:31.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also helped us to face
the challenges ahead.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now my youngest son and I
are serving as ministerial servants,

00:20:37.117 --> 00:20:40.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife has been serving
as a regular pioneer

00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the past 17 years.

00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:46.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She continued pioneering even while
we were in the internment camp.

00:20:46.668 --> 00:20:50.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that Jehovah is always there,

00:20:50.047 --> 00:20:53.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for us and sustaining us continuously.

00:20:54.969 --> 00:20:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how wonderful
that our amazing God, Jehovah,

00:20:58.305 --> 00:21:00.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped this dear brother
and his family

00:21:00.474 --> 00:21:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they would be able
to attend the convention!

00:21:03.102 --> 00:21:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, dear brothers,
what have we seen thus far in this talk?

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been able to see
that in the past, in Bible times,

00:21:08.983 --> 00:21:11.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was
the Savior of his people.

00:21:11.277 --> 00:21:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in our modern times right now,
we see how Jehovah

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is strengthening us
and acting on our behalf

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:19.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can continue
to serve him faithfully.

00:21:19.994 --> 00:21:22.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what about the very near future?

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:24.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we say about that?

00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:27.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know
that these last days

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are very soon going to lead
into the great tribulation.

00:21:30.797 --> 00:21:33.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said
at Matthew 24:21,

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is going to be a “great tribulation
such as has not occurred

00:21:37.887 --> 00:21:42.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the world’s beginning until now,
no, nor will occur again.”

00:21:42.684 --> 00:21:46.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the destruction
of Babylon the Great

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:50.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and before the outbreak of Armageddon,
what is going to happen?

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:55.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog of Magog,
this coalition of nations,

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to lead an all-out attack
on Jehovah’s servants.

00:22:00.077 --> 00:22:03.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now,
knowing that that attack

00:22:03.664 --> 00:22:07.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is coming closer and closer every day,
how should we be feeling?

00:22:07.209 --> 00:22:10.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should it make us feel
just completely filled with anxiety?

00:22:10.379 --> 00:22:13.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we be in terror
of those events that are coming?

00:22:13.507 --> 00:22:15.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:22:15.509 --> 00:22:20.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me
what Jesus said here in Revelation chapter 2.

00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:24.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at Revelation 2:10,

00:22:24.143 --> 00:22:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is speaking to anointed Christians

00:22:27.396 --> 00:22:29.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation of Smyrna.

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:32.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what
he says to them:

00:22:32.235 --> 00:22:36.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid of the things
you are about to suffer.

00:22:36.823 --> 00:22:37.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:22:37.865 --> 00:22:41.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Devil will keep on throwing
some of you into prison

00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:44.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be
fully put to the test,

00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:48.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will have tribulation
for ten days.

00:22:48.042 --> 00:22:51.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Prove yourself faithful
even to death,

00:22:51.629 --> 00:22:55.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will give you
the crown of life.”

00:22:55.592 --> 00:22:59.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, what do we discern
from these words of Jesus?

00:22:59.471 --> 00:23:03.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,
those who die faithfully

00:23:03.391 --> 00:23:06.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep their integrity
are guaranteed

00:23:06.478 --> 00:23:09.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have salvation
from Jehovah.

00:23:09.189 --> 00:23:13.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s something else
that we can discern from these words.

00:23:13.276 --> 00:23:16.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us
that during these last days,

00:23:16.947 --> 00:23:21.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of Jehovah’s servants
are going to experience death.

00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:23.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our modern history already,

00:23:23.287 --> 00:23:26.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know our brothers
have been thrown into prison.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have been tortured
and, yes,

00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:33.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some have even been put to death
because of their integrity.

00:23:33.088 --> 00:23:35.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In South Korea alone,

00:23:35.341 --> 00:23:38.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over a period of some 70 years,

00:23:38.552 --> 00:23:43.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
19,352 of our brothers

00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:46.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were in prison
and 5 of those brothers

00:23:46.143 --> 00:23:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually put to death
because of their faith.

00:23:50.273 --> 00:23:53.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can we say
about those brothers in South Korea;

00:23:53.776 --> 00:23:57.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those that died in Nazi, Germany;
and those that died in Eritrea;

00:23:57.196 --> 00:24:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those that died during the Soviet Union
because of their faith?

00:24:01.284 --> 00:24:06.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that their salvation
is completely assured.

00:24:06.206 --> 00:24:10.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are completely safe
in the safest place in the universe

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the memory
of our Grand God, Jehovah.

00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:18.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well then, what about our brothers
who are experiencing

00:24:18.426 --> 00:24:20.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution right now?

00:24:20.762 --> 00:24:24.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that some of our brothers
are watching this program right now

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:29.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in countries where our work is banned
or under very, very severe restrictions.

00:24:29.855 --> 00:24:33.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we say about those
dear brothers and sisters?

00:24:33.275 --> 00:24:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read together
this encouraging thought

00:24:35.861 --> 00:24:38.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Psalm 67

00:24:38.197 --> 00:24:40.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 67

00:24:43.077 --> 00:24:45.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 1.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“God will show us favor

00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:53.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bless us; he will make
his face shine upon us

00:24:53.712 --> 00:24:57.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that your way may be known
throughout the earth,

00:24:57.007 --> 00:25:00.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your acts of salvation
among all the nations.”

00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:02.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:25:02.555 --> 00:25:05.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah is doing
what verse 1 says.

00:25:05.266 --> 00:25:07.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s showing his favor,
and he’s blessing

00:25:07.852 --> 00:25:10.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his people in these countries
where the work is under ban.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as a result,
we are able to see

00:25:13.649 --> 00:25:17.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s acts of salvation
for his people.

00:25:17.236 --> 00:25:19.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, there are
so many examples of this.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish we had another hour
to be able to tell you all of them.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’d like to just share
one experience

00:25:24.869 --> 00:25:28.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is similar to many,
many more that we have received.

00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It comes from Russia.

00:25:30.166 --> 00:25:33.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of our sisters was there
in the prison in Russia.

00:25:33.503 --> 00:25:36.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of the female prisoners
who were in the cell with her

00:25:36.673 --> 00:25:39.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were imprisoned
for selling drugs.

00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:42.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one day, these two prisoners
began singing songs

00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:45.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about criminal life.

00:25:45.015 --> 00:25:47.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the sister didn’t understand
the language, but she just knew

00:25:47.684 --> 00:25:51.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the thoughts and the ideas
in these songs were immoral and foul.

00:25:51.897 --> 00:25:54.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she just didn’t want
to be in that environment.

00:25:54.274 --> 00:25:56.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she prayed
to Jehovah to help her.

00:25:56.819 --> 00:25:59.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, suddenly,
one of the women began singing

00:25:59.738 --> 00:26:02.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
song number 120
from our former songbook.

00:26:02.658 --> 00:26:04.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the sister was shocked.

00:26:04.702 --> 00:26:06.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How do you know this song?”
she asked.

00:26:06.912 --> 00:26:09.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then they all sang
the song together.

00:26:09.748 --> 00:26:14.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It turned out that this woman
had learned the song from her mother

00:26:14.003 --> 00:26:17.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had previously studied
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:26:17.089 --> 00:26:19.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had memorized the song.

00:26:19.467 --> 00:26:23.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister felt
the loving hand of Jehovah

00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:26.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in responding
to her prayer so quickly.

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:31.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh brothers, it’s a wonderful experience,
but there are so many similar experiences

00:26:31.354 --> 00:26:36.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah has shown
his hand on behalf of his people

00:26:36.192 --> 00:26:38.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in small ways
and sometimes in big ways.

00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:42.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s look
at one other experience.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many examples
of when our brothers, in the courtroom

00:26:46.911 --> 00:26:50.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during their own trials,
have made statements that are similar 

00:26:50.582 --> 00:26:54.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego said to Nebuchadnezzar.

00:26:54.377 --> 00:26:56.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to give
you one example.

00:26:56.379 --> 00:27:00.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the statement
from Brother Sergey Skrynnikov

00:27:00.133 --> 00:27:03.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave in the courtroom
at his own hearing.

00:27:03.512 --> 00:27:05.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a small excerpt.

00:27:05.847 --> 00:27:08.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Let us take a look
into the future.

00:27:08.392 --> 00:27:11.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If for another ten years or so
the government keeps putting 

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah’s Witnesses into prisons
and correctional colonies,

00:27:14.523 --> 00:27:18.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘there will be about 200
of them in every prison.

00:27:18.152 --> 00:27:20.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Imagine four congregations

00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:23.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of Jehovah’s Witnesses
in one prison!

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The prison administrators
will be begging

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the Ministry of Justice
to set Jehovah’s Witnesses free.

00:27:29.663 --> 00:27:33.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What do you imagine the majority
of Witnesses would pray for?

00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:36.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Lord, don’t soften
the heart of the government;

00:27:36.796 --> 00:27:39.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“don’t let him set me free.

00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:43.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have so many Bible students
and sincere people to talk to.”’

00:27:43.803 --> 00:27:46.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:49.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just hear the confidence
in his voice!

00:27:49.684 --> 00:27:53.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then look how he ended
his statement to the court.

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:55.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what he said:

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is one and the same
whether we are free or in prison.

00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, we are not abandoned.

00:28:02.238 --> 00:28:06.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He is with us everywhere
as long as we stay faithful to him.

00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:09.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . Hebrews 13:6 assures me:

00:28:09.204 --> 00:28:13.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah is my helper;
I will not be afraid.

00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:16.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What can man do to me?’

00:28:16.545 --> 00:28:21.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah God himself will help me.

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:24.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of whom should I be afraid?”

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:29.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Skrynnikov,
this very humble brother,

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made this powerful statement
in the courtroom.

00:28:32.394 --> 00:28:34.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it show us?

00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:37.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Jehovah
is strengthening his people.

00:28:37.691 --> 00:28:42.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s giving them the power and the courage
that they need to be so bold and so frank

00:28:42.696 --> 00:28:46.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before these powerful authorities.

00:28:46.116 --> 00:28:50.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we expect
in the very near future?

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:52.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This all-out attack

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:55.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Gog of Magog
will come against God’s people.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it begins,
what is Jehovah going to do?

00:28:58.963 --> 00:29:03.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let me read to you just an excerpt

00:29:03.175 --> 00:29:07.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our <i>Pure Worship</i> book
that just beautifully expresses

00:29:07.597 --> 00:29:09.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we can expect to see:

00:29:09.766 --> 00:29:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Before they are destroyed,
our enemies will see the sign

00:29:14.604 --> 00:29:18.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the Son of man,
likely a supernatural manifestation

00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:21.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the power of Jehovah and Jesus.

00:29:21.653 --> 00:29:26.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The opposers will see things
that cause them extreme anxiety.

00:29:26.658 --> 00:29:30.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As Jesus foretold,
‘people will become faint out of fear

00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:35.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and expectation of the things
coming upon the inhabited earth.’

00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:38.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To their horror, they will realize

00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:42.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that they miscalculated when they
attacked Jehovah’s people.

00:29:42.674 --> 00:29:46.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will be forced to know
the Creator in his role

00:29:46.011 --> 00:29:50.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as military commander,
Jehovah of armies.

00:29:50.015 --> 00:29:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will no doubt unleash
heavenly armies

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and natural forces
in such a way

00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:58.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he protects his loyal servants

00:29:58.273 --> 00:30:01.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but eliminates his enemies.”

00:30:01.068 --> 00:30:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful description!

00:30:03.112 --> 00:30:05.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just reminds me
of our video

00:30:05.698 --> 00:30:08.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a couple of years ago
at a regional convention where we saw

00:30:08.534 --> 00:30:12.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those forces coming against God’s people,
and then what did we see?

00:30:12.037 --> 00:30:15.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, suddenly, from the heavens,
here is Jesus Christ,

00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:20.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 144,000, and all those
heavenly armies riding into battle.

00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:23.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you remember that Jesus
just pulls back that bow

00:30:23.466 --> 00:30:28.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lets that arrow go,
and all of those enemies are gone forever.

00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:31.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
don’t you just long for the day

00:30:31.849 --> 00:30:35.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you will see those things
with your own eyes?

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:37.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful time

00:30:37.021 --> 00:30:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be when we experience
the salvation of Jehovah!

00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can we say

00:30:44.988 --> 00:30:47.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we have discussed
this wonderful topic

00:30:47.324 --> 00:30:50.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah
as our Grand Savior?

00:30:50.452 --> 00:30:54.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we look to the future,
we really can have the confidence

00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:57.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Isaiah 12:2 says.

00:30:57.626 --> 00:30:59.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it

00:30:59.169 --> 00:31:04.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 12:2.

00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:06.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Look!

00:31:06.051 --> 00:31:08.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is my salvation.

00:31:08.512 --> 00:31:11.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will trust
and feel no dread;

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:15.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jah Jehovah
is my strength and my might,

00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:19.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has become
my salvation.”

00:31:19.106 --> 00:31:23.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as Isaiah said,
we have no reason to fear

00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:27.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we have no reason to dread
if we have our confidence

00:31:27.615 --> 00:31:29.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our God, Jehovah.

00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:33.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, whether we face
death with dignity

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:37.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these last days
or we experience

00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:40.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
miraculous deliverance
at the great tribulation,

00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:43.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either way,
what can we say?

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that we
will have the same outcome.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:51.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will all experience the salvation
that comes from our God, Jehovah,

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:56.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because what is the assurance
that Isaiah 54:17 gives us?

00:31:56.895 --> 00:32:00.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No weapon formed against you

00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:02.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have any success.”

00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:06.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers,
if we have that confidence

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:09.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
truly is our Grand Savior,

00:32:09.032 --> 00:32:12.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then no matter what calamity,
no matter what terror,

00:32:12.661 --> 00:32:16.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what trial
may come upon us now or in the future,

00:32:16.414 --> 00:32:19.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be able to continue to rejoice

00:32:19.668 --> 00:32:23.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s acts of salvation.

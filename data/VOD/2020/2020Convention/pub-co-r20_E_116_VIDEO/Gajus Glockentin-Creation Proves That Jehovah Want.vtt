A well-designed body
is indeed a reason for us to rejoice.

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:10.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certain body parts
help us to perceive the world around us.

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:15.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
please turn with me to Proverbs 20:12.

00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:20.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us see what the Scriptures say
in connection with two sensory organs.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:23.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Proverbs 20:12, we read:

00:00:25.173 --> 00:00:27.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The hearing ear and the seeing eye

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah has made both of them.”

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our ability
to hear and see is from Jehovah.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are
that he has given us the senses!

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:42.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They allow us to enjoy life more fully.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:47.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ear, for example,
allows us to hear delightful sounds.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does it make you feel
when you hear birds chirping

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:55.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the relaxing sound of a babbling brook?

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we cherish
hearing the voice of a loved one

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:04.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe your mate,
your father or mother, or your child!

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also enjoy beautiful music.

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:10.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even those who cannot hear can enjoy music.

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:15.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some connect with a song’s bass notes
or its speed rather than its melody.

00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:20.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note how Jehovah created us

00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy a wide variety of sounds.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:37.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our world is full of sounds.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are natural.

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:57.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others we create.

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:03.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hear music before we’re born

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can develop a love of music as we grow.

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can compose music,

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:16.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be moved by it,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replay it in our minds.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:21.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Musical instruments typically

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:25.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
combine a sound generator,
which produces tones

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:28.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a resonator,
such as wood or metal,

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which adds volume.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:35.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But few instruments compare

00:02:37.274 --> 00:02:40.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the beauty of the human voice.

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:45.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can listen to things
that draw us closer to God

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use the voice he gave us

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to praise him with joy.

00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:03.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praise Jah, for Jehovah is good.

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sing praises to his name,

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for it is pleasant.”

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, sounds definitely enrich our life;

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they make our life more enjoyable.

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:25.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this not instill in us
the desire to praise Jehovah?

00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:30.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us, please, open to Isaiah 30:21.

00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:33.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we see that ears and hearing

00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:36.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sometimes used
in a figurative way in the Bible.

00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:40.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:21 reads:

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And your own ears
will hear a word behind you saying,

00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:45.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is the way.

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:48.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Walk in it,’
in case you should go to the right

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in case you should go to the left.”

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:56.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hear Jehovah’s figurative voice
from his Word, the Bible,

00:03:56.067 --> 00:03:59.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from his guidance
through the holy spirit in the congregation.

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s guidance is so clear

00:04:01.782 --> 00:04:06.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is as if we could hear him
speaking to us.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me ask you a question:

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the sound of Jehovah’s voice
make you enjoy life?

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it make you rejoice?

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose you would all answer
with a clear yes.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:22.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s voice is a delightful sound.

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:25.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know how good it feels

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:29.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we apply Jehovah’s guidance
and enjoy success in life.

00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:34.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think again about our literal ears.

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:37.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are very sensitive,
so we need to protect them.

00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:41.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certain sounds, or noise,
can even damage them.

00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to protect our hearing,

00:04:43.994 --> 00:04:49.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might use acoustic earmuffs
to block out harmful noise.

00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:53.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about our figurative ears?

00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:55.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we need to protect them too?

00:04:55.757 --> 00:04:58.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there sounds out there that can harm us?

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are.

00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reality is that we live in a world

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:07.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full of damaging and unpleasant noise.

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:11.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, how can we protect ourselves?

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:14.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three measures we need to take.

00:05:14.694 --> 00:05:19.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, block out the harmful noise around us.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can put on noise-canceling headphones.

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:27.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
we refuse to listen to anything

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can distance us from Jehovah.

00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like what?

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:36.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deceptive reasoning and false accusations,
for example, are very dangerous.

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:40.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They undermine our trust
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:05:40.597 --> 00:05:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who were once part
of the Christian congregation

00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:45.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now attempt to mislead us.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:50.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They spread half-truths and outright lies
about Jehovah’s organization.

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:56.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Harmful sounds might also come
from non-Christian workmates,

00:05:56.447 --> 00:06:00.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
schoolmates, or contacts on social media.

00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:03.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not share our beliefs,

00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:06.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so conversations with them
are rarely faith-strengthening.

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might weaken our faith,

00:06:09.378 --> 00:06:13.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making our Christian life course
more difficult.

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:17.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to protect our ears
from damaging noise

00:06:17.303 --> 00:06:20.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not listening to it.

00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:25.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the second way
to protect ourselves from damaging sounds?

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Headphones can help us
block out the noise around us

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:35.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replace it with something delightful
—maybe a favorite song.

00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:40.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put on our figurative headphones

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:43.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to wholesome things

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our favorite sounds,
delightful sounds from Jehovah.

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what we hear
at our Christian meetings.

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:55.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we sing at our Christian meetings,
like we’ve seen in the video,

00:06:55.553 --> 00:06:59.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our sounds praise Jehovah.

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:03.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we read in our publications,
what we see on our website,

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we hear in upbuilding conversations
with our brothers and sisters

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of these beautiful sounds
protect our ears.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:19.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third aid for protecting our ears
is Jehovah’s help.

00:07:19.704 --> 00:07:23.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we might not feel like
putting on our headphones.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might argue:

00:07:25.752 --> 00:07:29.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It is so much more comfortable without them.

00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The damage to my ears
will not be that serious.’

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is where Jehovah comes into play.

00:07:37.307 --> 00:07:40.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will help us listen to his voice

00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:42.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we ask him for his help in prayer.

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:47.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will motivate us
to put on our headphones, so to speak.

00:07:47.025 --> 00:07:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives us the inner strength
to stop listening

00:07:50.112 --> 00:07:53.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sounds that might be tempting
and yet are so dangerous.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:08:00.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are the three ways
to protect our figurative ears?

00:08:01.374 --> 00:08:04.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stop listening to damaging sounds,

00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:07.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we listen to wholesome things,

00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:11.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray for Jehovah’s help.

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:15.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
Jehovah created sounds

00:08:15.097 --> 00:08:18.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he wants us to enjoy life.

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:22.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please let us continue
to make wise use of our hearing,

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:27.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we will rejoice
in hearing delightful sounds forever.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:31.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother John Ekrann,

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:33.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee,

00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:37.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the last talk of this symposium:

00:08:37.246 --> 00:08:41.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves
That Jehovah Wants Us to Rejoice

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:43.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Fascinating Animals.”

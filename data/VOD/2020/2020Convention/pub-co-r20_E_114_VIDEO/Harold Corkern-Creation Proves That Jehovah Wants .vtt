One of the most precious gifts

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we enjoy as humans is the gift of sight.

00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:11.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sight is possible because of the way

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:15.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our eyes and our brain work together.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The complexity of our eyes

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their connectivity with our brain

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give strong evidence of a very wise Designer.

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:31.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that Designer
is clearly identified for us in the Bible.

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:34.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to the book of Psalms,

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:39.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to look at Psalm 94:9.

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:42.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads this way:

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One who made the ear, can he not hear?

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The One who formed the eye,
can he not see?”

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah created the eye
and our ability to see.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re very grateful for that.

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t make it
just so that we see in one color,

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:06.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just so that we can move around and work
and function safely and efficiently.

00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:08.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us the ability to see

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:13.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wide variety of colors
that enrich our lives.

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:16.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We very much appreciate the brilliant colors

00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:20.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of butterflies, birds, fishes, and flowers.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your favorite color?

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it red, blue, green?

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:31.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may say,
‘You’ve only given me three choices.’

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true.

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:38.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many color possibilities
are there that we can see?

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do our eyes
and our brain work together

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to produce this variety of colors?

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what role
does light play in this process?

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:52.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These questions will be answered
in the following video.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please take note of how all
of this wonderful design by Jehovah

00:01:57.063 --> 00:02:00.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reassures us that our Creator
wants us to rejoice.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is color?

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how we perceive wavelengths of light.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:22.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Objects that reflect all wavelengths
of visible light appear white.

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:26.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an object reflects
only some wavelengths,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see color.

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cells in our eye detect light

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send signals to our brain.

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three kinds of color-sensing cells:

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those that detect red,

00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:48.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
green,

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blue.

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:53.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we perceive other colors?

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:58.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mixing red, green, and blue light

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:00.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changes the color we see.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This flower is yellow because it reflects

00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:09.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
red and green light into our eye.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With just three kinds of color receptors,

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:17.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can distinguish some ten million colors.

00:03:21.487 --> 00:03:23.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Color triggers our emotions.

00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:28.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue and green can calm us.

00:03:29.538 --> 00:03:31.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Red and orange can excite!

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, descriptions that include

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:38.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
color help us learn.

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any doubt

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:43.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God gave us
the gift of color for our joy? 

00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:50.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I put my rainbow in the cloud,

00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:53.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it will serve as a sign of the covenant

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:55.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between me and the earth.”

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:05.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are that Jehovah

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:09.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave us this ability
to see a variety of colors!

00:04:09.414 --> 00:04:13.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And color has an impact on our emotions.

00:04:13.502 --> 00:04:17.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the color red

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:22.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s a very highly visible color,
and it’s filled with energy.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:25.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s associated with danger.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And red, it’s said,
can actually make us breathe faster

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even raise our blood pressure.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the other hand,
green is a very calming color.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very tranquil,

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:42.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why when we look
at a beautiful green garden

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:44.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a beautiful hillside,

00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:47.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, we feel very relaxed.

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides affecting our emotions,

00:04:50.834 --> 00:04:54.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has used color in the Scriptures

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach us Bible truths
and to help us remember them.

00:04:58.717 --> 00:05:00.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate,

00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you think of
when I mention the following:

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:08.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a white horse, a red horse,

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a black horse, a pale horse?

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:16.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, right away your minds
went to the book of Revelation, didn’t they?

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you understand
what these four horses picture.

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The white horse pictures Jesus Christ

00:05:23.703 --> 00:05:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the enthroned King,
riding in righteous warfare;

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the red horse pictures the bloody warfare

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the nations in these last days;

00:05:34.172 --> 00:05:37.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the black horse, stark famine;

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the pale horse

00:05:39.052 --> 00:05:42.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we’re quite familiar
with these days, aren’t we?),

00:05:42.097 --> 00:05:45.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pale horse pictures dreaded disease

00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:49.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pandemics leading to death.

00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:51.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see how Jehovah used color

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:56.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach us Bible truths
and to help us remember them.

00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:00.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another way
that Jehovah has used scriptures

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and color
to teach us about him.

00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:09.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example of this is at Ezekiel 1:26-28,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah gives Ezekiel

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:16.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a beautiful, brilliant view of his throne.

00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:21.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And among all this glory,
there is a beautiful rainbow.

00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:24.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does a rainbow picture?

00:06:24.393 --> 00:06:27.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rainbow denotes peacefulness,

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:31.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calmness, tranquility
—indicating what?

00:06:31.818 --> 00:06:34.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That with all of his dynamic energy,

00:06:34.612 --> 00:06:38.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a calm, peaceful God.

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:40.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s very reassuring to us,

00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:42.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are endeared to him.

00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, earlier we talked
about the association of light with color.

00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:53.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the Scriptures,
Jehovah uses light to depict something

00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:57.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how he increases
our understanding of Bible truths.

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 4:18, the Bible says:

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:05.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the path of the righteous
is like the bright morning light

00:07:05.687 --> 00:07:09.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grows brighter and brighter
until full daylight.”

00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:15.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this applies spiritually,
but we can understand it literally, can’t we?

00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:18.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re taking
an early morning walk in the countryside

00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sun has not come up yet,

00:07:20.996 --> 00:07:24.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can see things
but you’re not quite sure what you see.

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:27.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps you
don’t even know what color they are.

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:29.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the sun comes up,

00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:31.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, you see clearly
what you were looking at:

00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a beautiful white fence, a green pasture,

00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:37.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a big, stately red barn in the distance.

00:07:37.388 --> 00:07:42.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now your appreciation
for your walk has been enhanced.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise,
the Bible tells us at 2 Corinthians 4:6:

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:50.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let the light shine out of darkness,’

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:52.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he has shone on our hearts

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:56.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to illuminate them
with the glorious knowledge of God.”

00:07:56.868 --> 00:08:01.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides his servants
with spiritual enlightenment,

00:08:01.206 --> 00:08:03.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helps us to understand

00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:07.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deeply appreciate Bible truths even more.

00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result, we understand them,

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:12.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re motivated to apply them,

00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:15.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this draws us closer
to our heavenly Father.

00:08:15.888 --> 00:08:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how thankful we are
that Jehovah created us

00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:22.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the ability to see color!

00:08:22.687 --> 00:08:26.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It enriches our lives, touches our emotions,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to learn and remember Bible truths,

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:32.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to understand
our heavenly Father better.

00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:36.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the light that he provides
gives us a progressive improvement

00:08:36.827 --> 00:08:39.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our Bible understanding.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we are for the gift
that Jehovah has given us to see color!

00:08:44.335 --> 00:08:46.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is strong evidence

00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:50.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he really wants us
to enjoy life to the full.

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:56.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now let’s give our attention
to Brother Robert Luccioni,

00:08:56.682 --> 00:09:00.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will now present
the next talk of this symposium:

00:09:00.228 --> 00:09:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves That Jehovah Wants Us
to Rejoice

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Our Well-Designed Bodies.”

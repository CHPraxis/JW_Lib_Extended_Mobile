Our theme does not end
in the form of a question.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:12.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it is a statement of fact.

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:15.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can rejoice despite danger.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along as we look
to the example that the apostle Paul set.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to rejoice despite danger,

00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:27.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he faced many dangers in his ministry.

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:31.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one verse,
he mentions eight different types

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:36.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of dangers he faced,
including “dangers from robbers.”

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:41.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While in Ephesus,
Paul may even have been exposed

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wild beasts in an arena.

00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:47.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
to 2 Corinthians chapter 1,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 8-11.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what it says:

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:03.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we do not want you to be unaware,

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brothers, of the tribulation we experienced

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the province of Asia.”

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he wrote this
while he was in Europe—Macedonia.

00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continues:

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were under extreme pressure

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:21.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beyond our own strength,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that we were very uncertain
even of our lives.

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:30.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, we felt that we had received
 the sentence of death.

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:34.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This was so that we would trust,

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:39.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not in ourselves, but in the God
who raises up the dead.

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:42.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From such a great risk of death

00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did rescue us and will rescue us,

00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:50.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and our hope is in him that he
will also continue to rescue us.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:55.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You also can help us
by your supplication for us,

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:59.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order that many
may give thanks in our behalf

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:03.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the favor we receive
in answer to the prayers of many.”

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Less than a year earlier,

00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:11.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had written his first letter
to the Corinthians.

00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:15.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, he was in Asia,
the city of Ephesus.

00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:18.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 15th chapter of that letter,

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 32 says:

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:27.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If like other men,
I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus,

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:30.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what good is it to me?”

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His comments would fit an experience

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with literal wild beasts in the arena.

00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:41.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Paul’s hope
in the resurrection strengthened him,

00:02:41.238 --> 00:02:46.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he said: “This was so that we would trust,

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:51.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in ourselves,
but in the God who raises up the dead.”

00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:56.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was also encouraged
and strengthened by fellow Christians.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:03:01.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “You also can help us

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by your supplication for us,

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order that many
may give thanks in our behalf

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the favor we receive
in answer to the prayers of many.”

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation,
we also enjoy a warm brotherhood,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which provides assistance
and support in numerous ways.

00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point in his ministry,

00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul and his traveling companions

00:03:27.283 --> 00:03:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt “extreme pressure”

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were “uncertain even of [their] lives.”

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:38.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did Paul find support and relief?

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was encouraged and consoled

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:45.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fellow Christians who came to his aid.

00:03:45.242 --> 00:03:49.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When natural disasters
or other calamities strike,

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time and again our Christian brothers
are the first on the scene

00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:57.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to render needed assistance
materially and spiritually

00:03:57.618 --> 00:04:01.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fellow Christians
as well as to others in need.

00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:05.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Christians are not exposed

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:07.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wild beasts in arenas.

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, like Paul,

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can rejoice

00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:16.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite danger that we may face.

00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any of us can face “dangers from robbers,”

00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:22.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the threat of physical assault,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in times of civil unrest.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:29.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible foretold that in these “last days,”

00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:34.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people would be “fierce,
without love of goodness.”

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:37.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:40.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which provisions helped one family

00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite such dangers.

00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:59.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Caracas and live

00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:01.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an area of the city called Petare.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Petare, I have to live

00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:05.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with violence and delinquency.

00:05:06.997 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years ago,
we lost a pioneer sister who,

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:11.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sadly, was hit by a bullet.

00:05:12.706 --> 00:05:15.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, something like that
also happened to my son.

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a confrontation

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the neighborhood,
and a stray bullet hit my son

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:24.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and killed him instantly.

00:05:30.207 --> 00:05:32.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That left such a void.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:36.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It hurt me to go into his room
and see his empty bed.

00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:38.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then to see his things:

00:05:38.124 --> 00:05:41.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his shoes, his favorite clothes.

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see them in the wardrobe—

00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:45.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Crying was inevitable.

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:51.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These situations were very difficult 
to deal with at the time.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as the congregation

00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:59.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found out about the situation,

00:05:59.584 --> 00:06:02.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right away they gave me support.

00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:05.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were there to help care
for all the things you need to do

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you lose a loved one.

00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:13.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After going through all that,
I was very afraid

00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue
going out in field service.

00:06:15.335 --> 00:06:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feared for my life

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the life of my family.

00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:22.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:26.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave me
practical wisdom to continue.

00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:33.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when I’m alone meditating
and thinking about my son,

00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those memories return and,
of course, I have a setback,

00:06:39.128 --> 00:06:41.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so to speak,

00:06:41.128 --> 00:06:44.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I begin to cry again.

00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:47.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keeping clearly in mind
the promise of the resurrection

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what motivates
me to keep going.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An account that I really like

00:06:56.587 --> 00:07:00.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I always keep in mind
is the account about Lazarus.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:03.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, Martha uses an expression.

00:07:03.213 --> 00:07:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says, ‘I know
he’ll rise on the last day.’

00:07:07.338 --> 00:07:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the same confidence
that I have in Jehovah.

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that my son will rise.

00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:14.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give him to me.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time
that this terrible thing happened,

00:07:22.422 --> 00:07:25.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s true that I lost my joy for a time.

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later after the mourning passes,

00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:33.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resurrection hope gives us joy.

00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:35.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if

00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:37.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah speaks to me,
saying, ‘Keep calm.’

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if he gives me a gentle pat,

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling me to ‘keep going
and that’s what will happen to you.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep faithful, and continue loyal,
and I will give him back to you.’

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:55.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what helped this family

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:58.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite danger?

00:07:58.008 --> 00:08:01.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer, their hope in the resurrection,

00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:06.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the supportive brotherhood
and, of course, Jehovah’s spirit.

00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:11.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which provisions from Jehovah
are helping you to rejoice

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:14.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the dangers you may have to face?

00:08:14.384 --> 00:08:17.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your relationship with Jehovah,

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:19.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brotherhood,

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:23.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hope, or something else?

00:08:23.634 --> 00:08:28.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these last days,
with “critical times hard to deal with,”

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are being admonished
to rejoice in the hope

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of deliverance from danger.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We long for the end of this wicked system,
just as Habakkuk longed for relief

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from wickedness in his day.

00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:45.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Habakkuk chapter 1.

00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:50.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feel the stress that he felt
as a result of the violence, quarreling,

00:08:50.927 --> 00:08:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and oppression that surrounded him.

00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:59.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asks: “How long, O Jehovah . . . ?

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long must I ask
for help from violence . . . ?

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:05.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And why do you tolerate oppression?

00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:11.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”

00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Why?
Why? Why?

00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:23.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long?

00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:27.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But note what he recorded
in chapter 2, verse 3:

00:09:29.888 --> 00:09:34.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the vision is yet
for its appointed time,

00:09:34.472 --> 00:09:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it is rushing toward its end,
and it will not lie.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if it should delay,

00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:44.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“keep in expectation of it!

00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:47.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For it will without fail come true.

00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:50.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will not be late!”

00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:54.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Habakkuk, we trust in Jehovah

00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:59.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the assurance
that He will soon end violence.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:04.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk took the initiative
to draw close to Jehovah,

00:10:04.348 --> 00:10:07.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his trusted Friend and Father.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not just fret over his situation,

00:10:10.224 --> 00:10:12.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relying on his own understanding.

00:10:12.349 --> 00:10:17.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he prayed
about his feelings and worries.

00:10:17.308 --> 00:10:20.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good example for us.

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:25.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his resolve in chapter 3 and verse 18.

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he says:

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As for me, I will exult in Jehovah;

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:39.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.”

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:44.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jehovah, the “Hearer of prayer,”

00:10:44.184 --> 00:10:46.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invites us to show our trust

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:50.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by prayerfully sharing our concerns with him.

00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:54.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah didn’t reprove Habakkuk
for expressing his anxieties.

00:10:54.727 --> 00:10:56.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had them recorded,

00:10:56.727 --> 00:11:01.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely to show that it’s only natural
for us to have such feelings at times.

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:04.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah wants us to call out to him.

00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so will help us
to experience Jehovah’s response

00:11:09.144 --> 00:11:14.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his warm embrace
by means of his kind guidance.

00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:17.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will help us
to know his thoughts

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what afflicts us.

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:23.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heartfelt prayers

00:11:23.562 --> 00:11:27.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are one of the deepest expressions
of our trust in God.

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:31.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice in knowing that Jehovah

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is eager to deliver us
from all forms of danger!

00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:41.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Schafer,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:44.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present 
the final talk of this symposium,

00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:49.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Sword.”

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:06.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As disciple-makers,
we are somewhat like a carpenter

00:00:06.027 --> 00:00:08.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has a toolbox, and inside,

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:11.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has hand tools and he has power tools.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:16.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likes the power tools because they
save him a lot of time and energy.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a power drill
that can penetrate hardwood.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a power sander

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:25.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can strip away layers of built-up grime.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a power nailer

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can nail together pieces very quickly.

00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:35.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise, we have a Teaching Toolbox,

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:39.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inside, we have many useful tools.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s no question,

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:45.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most powerful tool we have is God’s Word.

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul
described God’s Word

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:51.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 4:12:

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:57.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the word of God
is alive and exerts power

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:01.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:06.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pierces even
to the dividing of soul and spirit,

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of joints from the marrow,

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is able to discern
thoughts and intentions of the heart.”

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:17.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul says it’s like a sword
that can pierce right to the heart.

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is that important
in our disciple-making work?

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because we cannot read hearts.

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:28.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we use God’s powerful Word,

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:31.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we begin to discern whether the person

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:34.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “rightly disposed for everlasting life”

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:36.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can perhaps help that person

00:01:36.998 --> 00:01:40.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like using the carpenter’s power tools.

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:45.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, it can penetrate
right to the heart of a person.

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:48.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can strip away what’s on the surface

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:52.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help the person
realize what he really is.

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can really nail down the points.

00:01:55.435 --> 00:02:00.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul
realized God’s Word was dynamic.

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:02.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it is described that way.

00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:04.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s dynamic because it comes

00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:07.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the living God, Jehovah.

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:12.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, these words
are not just words on a page.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:17.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that these
are words from the mouth of Jehovah.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother asked this question,

00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:25.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you were preaching
from house to house with Jehovah himself,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you do all the speaking
or would you allow him to talk?”

00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:32.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we open the Bible,

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are allowing Jehovah to speak,
and that is powerful.

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:42.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul went
to the city of Thessalonica,

00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:46.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he found Gentiles
worshipping lifeless idols.

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:48.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 1:9,
Paul wrote that these Gentiles

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had ‘turned away from their lifeless idols

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:57.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve the true and living God.’

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that happen?

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 2, verse 13, Paul noted

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they had ‘received the word of God’

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:09.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that word
was ‘at work in those believers.’

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul rejoiced with those results.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for us too, one of our greatest joys

00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:18.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to see how a new disciple

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows God’s Word to work in him,

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he makes big changes.

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
notice how Neeta

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unleashes the power of God’s Word.

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:54.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi again.

00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:59.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re really quite stealthy.

00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brilliant, right?

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:03.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s perfect when I’m late for class,

00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:05.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is always.

00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:07.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:11.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last week you spoke about promises,

00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:14.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m not about church,

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:17.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I am about promises.

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:18.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

00:04:18.378 --> 00:04:21.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well, if these are God’s promises,

00:04:21.507 --> 00:04:24.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t it make sense to go to his Word
to find out how to enjoy them?

00:04:24.844 --> 00:04:25.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seems right.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:30.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is John 17:3.

00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:32.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to read it?

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, out loud?

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:41.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?
Don’t you know what it says?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do, but it’s nice to hear it again.

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:50.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This means everlasting life,

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:54.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their coming to know you,
the only true God,

00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:57.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one
whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

00:04:58.922 --> 00:05:01.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, based on this,
what means everlasting life?

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:03.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting to know God.

00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:10.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you get to know something
you’re not even sure exists?

00:05:10.183 --> 00:05:13.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to explore that answer
next time you come by?

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:16.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who said anything about next time?

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I’m just winding you up.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you later.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:32.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see how Neeta
unleashed the power of God’s Word?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:37.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She asked a simple question
that led to reading John 17:3.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is a simple but powerful scripture.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:45.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was the most skillful Disciple-Maker.

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:49.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He based his teaching
completely on God’s Word.

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:53.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it was possible,
he actually read from the Scriptures.

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:58.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may remember
the account in Luke chapter 4,

00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:02.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus went back
to his hometown of Nazareth,

00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:07.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he entered the synagogue
and he read from the scroll of Isaiah.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the prophecy about the Anointed One

00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:14.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would preach good news
in God’s acceptable year.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus didn’t stop
at just reading the scripture;

00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:21.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he explained its meaning.

00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:24.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Today this scripture

00:06:24.763 --> 00:06:27.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you just heard is fulfilled.”

00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:30.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those townspeople
could have understood that

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had left the town,

00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:35.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
left his carpentry work months earlier,

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had begun his ministry.

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, it’s not enough
for us just to read a scripture;

00:06:42.907 --> 00:06:45.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must explain its meaning.

00:06:45.535 --> 00:06:47.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Neeta did that.

00:06:47.662 --> 00:06:52.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember after John 17:3 was read,
she asked this question,

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:57.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So based on this,
what means everlasting life?”

00:06:57.422 --> 00:06:59.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the girl got it.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means getting to know God.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do, though,
if our listener doesn’t get it?

00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:12.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can just reread
the key words in that verse.

00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:16.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, friends,
we must be careful

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to assume that people understand
the terms we commonly use.

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:24.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we often talk about the Kingdom.

00:07:24.118 --> 00:07:28.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to our listener,
they may be thinking of heaven.

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may be thinking it’s a condition
of one’s heart, not a government.

00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:35.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to explain.

00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:40.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, be patient as we use God’s Word.

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:43.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in God and appreciation

00:07:43.054 --> 00:07:46.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Scriptures take time to grow.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus illustrated this

00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:52.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mark 4:26.

00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:54.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just read that:

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he went on to say:

00:07:57.236 --> 00:07:59.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘In this way the Kingdom of God is just

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as when a man casts seeds on the ground.’”

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:05.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, like a farmer,

00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:09.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we spread the Kingdom message,
we’re casting seeds,

00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:13.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do we expect those seeds
to sprout overnight?

00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:18.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explains
the growth process in verse 28:

00:08:18.717 --> 00:08:23.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On its own the ground bears fruit gradually,

00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:26.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“first the stalk, then the head,

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:29.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally the full grain in the head.”

00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:33.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a gradual process.

00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:37.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The farmer waters
and nurtures the seed, but he must wait.

00:08:37.404 --> 00:08:41.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, we need to be
patient disciple-makers.

00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:44.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may take many return visits

00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:47.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we actually start a Bible study.

00:08:47.832 --> 00:08:51.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on each return visit,
let’s try to help the person

00:08:51.586 --> 00:08:56.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to progressively build faith in God’s Word.

00:08:56.049 --> 00:09:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example
of how we could help a person

00:09:00.303 --> 00:09:05.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to appreciate that the Bible
has practical up-to-date advice.

00:09:05.308 --> 00:09:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister does this:

00:09:07.811 --> 00:09:12.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She asks: “What would you say
is the key to getting along with people?

00:09:12.816 --> 00:09:17.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May I read a proverb from the Bible?”

00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:21.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she reads Proverbs 17:14, which says:

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:25.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Beginning a fight
is like opening a floodgate;

00:09:25.038 --> 00:09:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the quarrel
breaks out, take your leave.”

00:09:27.916 --> 00:09:29.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she asks,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think that this advice
could help us to get along with others?”

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:37.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A reasonable person would say yes.

00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:39.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help a person build faith

00:09:39.887 --> 00:09:43.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible
is a book of reliable prophecy?

00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:47.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, on one return visit,
we could briefly discuss

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophecy at Isaiah 13:20.

00:09:50.815 --> 00:09:54.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This says that the city of Babylon

00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would ‘never again be inhabited.’

00:09:57.406 --> 00:10:01.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq, 

00:10:01.994 --> 00:10:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the ruins of Babylon.

00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one lives there,
and no one has for centuries.

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help someone build faith

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:13.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there exists a Creator?

00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:17.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply read Hebrews 3:4:

00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:20.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every house is constructed by someone,

00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:24.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who constructed all things is God.”

00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:26.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we could ask:

00:10:26.728 --> 00:10:29.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If someone told you
that the house you live in

00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:33.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constructed itself, would you believe them?”

00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:35.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously not.

00:10:35.321 --> 00:10:40.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither could we really believe
that this whole universe constructed itself.

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brothers and sisters,

00:10:42.912 --> 00:10:45.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is a powerful tool.

00:10:45.874 --> 00:10:49.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s unleash its power in our ministry.

00:10:49.085 --> 00:10:52.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will become
more effective disciple-makers,

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:56.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will overflow with joy as we see

00:10:56.593 --> 00:11:00.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Word of God at work in a new believer.

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:04.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Splane,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:07.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next part of this symposium:

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:10.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills
—Illustrating Key Points.”

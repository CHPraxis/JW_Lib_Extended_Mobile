00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to be rich?

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most persons would immediately answer,
“Of course I do,”

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:16.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they think being rich
means that they will enjoy life

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have happiness and contentment.

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:22.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s ask a second question:

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you willing
to do to become rich?

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a lot harder
to answer, isn’t it?

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:33.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you think about the importance
of that question,

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:37.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read a very important warning
that the Bible gives us.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:41.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to take your Bibles,
please, and we’ll turn together

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the first book of Timothy

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Timothy 6:9, 10.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the warning:
“But those who are determined to be rich

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:58.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“fall into temptation and a snare

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and many senseless
and harmful desires

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:05.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that plunge men
into destruction and ruin.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the love of money is the root
of all sorts of injurious things,

00:01:09.758 --> 00:01:14.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and by reaching out for this love
some have been led astray from the faith

00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have stabbed themselves
all over with many pains.”

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:24.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that certainly is
a very important warning, isn’t it?

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look at it, we see
that although the Bible acknowledges

00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:32.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that money is useful,
it highlights here

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:34.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the love of money”
or, in other words,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those who are determined to be rich.”

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:40.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice at the end,
there at verse 10,

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:42.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that this can lead to persons

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being “stabbed . . . all over
with many pains.”

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:49.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, they have gain,

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they also have pain along with it.

00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:55.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s something else

00:01:55.764 --> 00:02:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can cause problems
for those who have a love for money.

00:02:00.143 --> 00:02:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may sacrifice their health.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may sacrifice their family life
and even their standards.

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:11.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible highlights yet something else
that they need to be careful about.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:16.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time, if we turn our Bibles
to the book of Proverbs,

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:21.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please turn with me to Proverbs 28:20.

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:26.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Proverbs 28:20:

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A faithful man will receive many blessings,

00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:33.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the one hastening to get rich

00:02:33.594 --> 00:02:37.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or, in other words, in a hurry
he quickly wants to get rich

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:42.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what does it say?—
well, that person] will not remain innocent.”

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t that true—that many people

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
steal, lie, cheat?

00:02:49.193 --> 00:02:52.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even prostitute themselves,

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:57.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others kill other persons
just to get rich.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:03:01.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, truly,
these are important questions

00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each one of us to think about.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:08.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why does the Bible
highlight so strongly

00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:11.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this warning
about trying to get rich?

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one of the reasons
is that the Bible highlights

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:18.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the deceptive power of riches.”

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you might be wondering,
‘What does that mean

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:24.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“the deceptive power of riches”?’

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe we
could illustrate it this way:

00:03:27.483 --> 00:03:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine you wake up
in the middle of a dark night.

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wind is blowing strongly.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rain is falling heavily,
and you start to worry about flooding.

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you see that there is no electricity.

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you start to grope around,
and you find a flashlight.

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:48.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of a sudden,
you feel like you have some help

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you can see what’s happening.

00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:54.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you try to turn it on,
there’s no light.

00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:59.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then you remember,
‘Ah, I just bought some batteries.’

00:03:59.557 --> 00:04:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you grope up around in the drawer,
you find, ‘Here, I’ve got a battery.’

00:04:04.103 --> 00:04:07.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you put them in with the hope

00:04:07.232 --> 00:04:09.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this will now give you light,

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:12.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the batteries are dead.

00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:15.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps there’s a problem with them.

00:04:15.198 --> 00:04:18.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is “the deceptive power.”

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:23.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You put your reliance on something,
and it doesn’t help you.

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:25.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:28.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
money can have that same type
of deceptive power.

00:04:28.962 --> 00:04:30.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may look at it.

00:04:30.964 --> 00:04:33.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may think, ‘Yes, this will help me.’

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:36.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happens in times of trouble?

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:42.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Bible helps us to see
that money doesn’t always give us

00:04:42.017 --> 00:04:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that we need
in times of problems.

00:04:44.854 --> 00:04:48.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just think
about three different areas of life.

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:53.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,
money doesn’t automatically mean

00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:55.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have genuine security.

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:57.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more money we have,
perhaps the more security that we need

00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:01.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have to protect it.

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:06.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we think about this,
the Bible clearly highlights the problem.

00:05:06.918 --> 00:05:11.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time, if you’d like to turn
with me to the book of Proverbs,

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to read
Proverbs chapter 18.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn there

00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:20.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Proverbs 18:11,

00:05:20.473 --> 00:05:25.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice this very interesting word picture
that the Bible uses here:

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:30.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wealth of the rich
is his fortified city;

00:05:30.484 --> 00:05:35.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is like a protective wall
in his imagination.”

00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is
very thought-provoking, isn’t it?

00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we
could illustrate it this way:

00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:46.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person might pay
a lot of money every month

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:51.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a security firm to care
for his home and his family.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each night
he may sleep very soundly.

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:59.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if he found out later
that this was a fake company?

00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:01.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were no security guards.

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:03.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was just paying money for nothing.

00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:07.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That security would be only security

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:09.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in his imagination,” wouldn’t it?

00:06:09.857 --> 00:06:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also highlights
another aspect of this,

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you’ll agree
with these comments.

00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:19.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 23 of the same book
(the book of Proverbs),

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 23:4, 5

00:06:24.873 --> 00:06:28.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starts with this very good warning:

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:06:32.714 --> 00:06:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop and show understanding.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now notice the word picture.]

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you cast your eyes on it
[that is, on wealth or money],

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is not there,
for it will surely sprout wings

00:06:48.313 --> 00:06:51.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like an eagle
and fly off into the sky.”

00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:54.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’m sure you’ve experienced that,
haven’t you?

00:06:54.528 --> 00:06:56.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your paycheck comes.

00:06:56.572 --> 00:06:58.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think, ‘Yes, I’ve got some money.’

00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You turn your back,
and all of a sudden, it’s gone.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s not enough money.

00:07:03.954 --> 00:07:08.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in a bigger sense,
in recent times, we’ve seen how money

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:12.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be devalued
and how even precious commodities,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as oil and gold,
can lose their value.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me: A number of years ago,
someone gave me this banknote.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking at it and reading it, it says:

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I promise to pay the bearer on demand

00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
20 billion dollars.”

00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:33.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:37.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On outward appearances,
it looks like I’m quite wealthy.

00:07:37.405 --> 00:07:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve probably guessed
that if I were to present this

00:07:41.284 --> 00:07:44.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and demand payment,
I really wouldn’t get much from it

00:07:44.913 --> 00:07:48.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this money
has been devalued.

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a similar way,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like the batteries that don’t work,

00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:55.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
money at times

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:59.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not give us the security that we want.

00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:01.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a second area

00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:05.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which money can’t automatically give
us what we want

00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:09.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is with regard
to happiness and contentment.

00:08:09.313 --> 00:08:14.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, money doesn’t automatically bring
happiness and contentment.

00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:19.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve probably seen accounts of persons
who appear to be very successful.

00:08:19.323 --> 00:08:21.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re famous.
They have money.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:26.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet when they’re interviewed,
they talk about how lonely they feel

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:29.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how meaningless
their lives are.

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:32.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly what
the Bible tells us.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:37.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions that someone
who accumulates a lot of money

00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:41.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is never really satisfied
with what they’ve already got.

00:08:41.137 --> 00:08:43.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want more.

00:08:43.014 --> 00:08:44.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:47.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve heard accounts of persons,
one way or another,

00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:51.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have accumulated billions of dollars,

00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they just keep on accumulating money,

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:57.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they couldn’t use all that money

00:08:57.237 --> 00:09:00.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 10 or 20 lifetimes.

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:04.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also tells us
that oftentimes a rich person

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:08.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stays awake at night
worrying about his money.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, there’s another area

00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:15.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is even more important
than those first two areas of life.

00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:18.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is that money

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot automatically bring God’s blessings.

00:09:23.514 --> 00:09:25.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an interesting thought.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that?

00:09:27.977 --> 00:09:31.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look to the words
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are recorded for us
in the book of Matthew.

00:09:34.567 --> 00:09:39.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn with me
to Matthew chapter 6,

00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:42.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 24.

00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:46.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words of Jesus
were part of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jesus says,

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:54.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 6:24:

00:09:54.337 --> 00:09:57.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one can slave for two masters;

00:09:57.549 --> 00:09:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for either he will hate the one

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and love the other,

00:10:01.845 --> 00:10:06.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or he will stick to the one
and despise the other.

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:11.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cannot slave
for God and for Riches.”

00:10:12.063 --> 00:10:14.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that says it very clearly,
doesn’t it?

00:10:14.775 --> 00:10:17.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
we have to make a choice.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t serve God
and Riches at the same time.

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:26.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this would affect our service
and our love of God.

00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:30.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So looking at those
three areas of life,

00:10:30.207 --> 00:10:33.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that money
can be like that dead battery.

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:37.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t necessarily give
us genuine security,

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:41.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t necessarily give us
happiness and contentment,

00:10:41.427 --> 00:10:46.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can interfere
with our relationship with God.

00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:50.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at a video,
and we’re going to see in this video

00:10:50.603 --> 00:10:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how two individuals are affected

00:10:53.189 --> 00:10:57.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by this love
for material things or for money.

00:11:03.992 --> 00:11:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought happiness was all about money

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:09.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting to buy whatever I wanted.

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:18.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really into fashion.

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:21.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was always thinking
about what I was going to get next,

00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:24.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t mind
putting in extra overtime to get it.

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:33.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My day ended with me
taking the last train home, eating,

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:36.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then going to bed
at one or two o’clock in the morning.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this affected me
mentally and physically.

00:11:41.655 --> 00:11:45.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d wake up in the middle
of the night with panic attacks.

00:11:47.328 --> 00:11:49.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so lost and confused.

00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:53.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I’d worked for
was for nothing.

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My motto for shopping was,

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:03.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When in doubt, buy!”

00:12:05.513 --> 00:12:09.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bought a lot of things:
powerful motorcycles, a house, cars.

00:12:11.853 --> 00:12:16.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was totally absorbed in work
and sometimes worked all night.

00:12:18.568 --> 00:12:21.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I somehow made it to meetings,

00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:24.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but after they ended,
I’d leave right away.

00:12:25.366 --> 00:12:28.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t show interest in anyone,
not even my wife.

00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:31.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I ever talked about was work,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I showed a real lack
of consideration for my wife.

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:37.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really blunt with her,

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there was a constant
back and forth between us.

00:12:41.925 --> 00:12:44.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had a strained relationship.

00:12:44.845 --> 00:12:46.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t happy.

00:12:46.847 --> 00:12:50.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just felt stress,
stress, and more stress.

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:52.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything seemed pointless.

00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:02.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we see in that video?

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice that both those individuals

00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really enjoyed going after money.

00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:11.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to be rich.

00:13:11.288 --> 00:13:14.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did they receive
happiness and contentment?

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:16.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:13:16.502 --> 00:13:18.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were problems
that came along with it.

00:13:18.588 --> 00:13:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gained some things
but with pain.

00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:27.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So considering all these factors
we’ve just discussed,

00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it mean that it’s wrong
for us to want to be rich?

00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:34.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:36.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that may sound like a contradiction,

00:13:36.898 --> 00:13:40.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let’s have a look at another scripture
in the book of Proverbs.

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time we’ll turn
to Proverbs chapter 10.

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:47.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 10 verse 22,

00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:52.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice it talks about
a different sort of riches.

00:13:52.247 --> 00:13:54.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read it in Proverbs 10:22:

00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:02.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
that makes one rich,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He adds no pain with it.”

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what is it

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really brings us true riches?

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s “the blessing of Jehovah.”

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:19.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the blessings
that we gain from God

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:24.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are true riches because (notice what it says
at the end of that verse)

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:27.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he adds no pain with it.”

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s gain without pain.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we think about this,
we might ask,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could we ever accumulate
these types of riches?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our Lord Jesus Christ
answered this in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:46.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you turn back with me
to the chapter that we already referred to,

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:50.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 6, you’ll notice here

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:54.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus describes to us
how we can obtain

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:57.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these genuine riches

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:19-21:

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:05.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop storing up for yourselves
treasures on the earth,

00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:10.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where moth and rust consume
and where thieves break in and steal.

00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:15.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, store up for yourselves
treasures in heaven,

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:18.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where neither moth
nor rust consumes,

00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:21.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and where thieves
do not break in and steal.

00:15:21.547 --> 00:15:26.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For where your treasure is,
there your heart will be also.”

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see what Jesus
is telling us here?

00:15:30.598 --> 00:15:35.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not just to strive after getting
material riches here on the earth,

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:40.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice that he says that we
should “store up . . . treasures in heaven.”

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:44.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is not talking
about an offshore bank account.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it’s talking in a symbolic way

00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:50.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how we can build up, as it were,

00:15:50.952 --> 00:15:53.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good relationship with God

00:15:53.288 --> 00:15:55.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of the things that we do.

00:15:55.915 --> 00:16:00.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, these are true treasures.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, when we think
about the life of Jesus Christ,

00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:06.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he <i>lived</i> by these things
that he preached.

00:16:06.927 --> 00:16:11.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t try to accumulate
all these material things in his life.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he focused on serving
his heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:16:17.813 --> 00:16:20.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t distracted by greed

00:16:20.482 --> 00:16:24.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by some desire
for personal fame and glory.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:29.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he focused on building up
these “treasures in heaven.”

00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:32.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might remember
that even at one time in His life,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil tried to tempt Him.

00:16:35.623 --> 00:16:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember that one
of those temptations involved this very fact

00:16:39.502 --> 00:16:44.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that Jesus resisted the desire
to accumulate material things?

00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn our Bibles this time
to the book of Matthew,

00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:53.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll look at one of the temptations,
as recorded here by Matthew.

00:16:53.141 --> 00:16:58.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Matthew 4:8-10,

00:16:59.522 --> 00:17:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here we’re told:

00:17:01.524 --> 00:17:06.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Again the Devil took him along
to an unusually high mountain

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:10.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and showed him all the kingdoms
of the world and their glory.

00:17:10.283 --> 00:17:14.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he said to him:
‘All these things I will give you

00:17:14.913 --> 00:17:19.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if you fall down
and do an act of worship to me.’

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus said to him:
‘Go away, Satan!

00:17:23.004 --> 00:17:27.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For it is written:
“It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:17:27.217 --> 00:17:32.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”’”

00:17:33.098 --> 00:17:36.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus clearly rejected this temptation

00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:39.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept from Satan

00:17:39.104 --> 00:17:42.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these riches and glories of the world.

00:17:42.524 --> 00:17:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His focus was on serving Jehovah.

00:17:46.195 --> 00:17:48.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the wise thing to do.

00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:50.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you stop and think about it,

00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:54.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, if riches
and the glory of the world

00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:57.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the very things
that make us happy,

00:17:57.498 --> 00:18:01.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why was Satan
willing to give all that away?

00:18:01.002 --> 00:18:04.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, it hadn’t given him happiness.

00:18:04.046 --> 00:18:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted something else, didn’t he?

00:18:06.215 --> 00:18:09.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus selected the right thing

00:18:09.135 --> 00:18:12.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to build up “treasures in heaven.”

00:18:12.597 --> 00:18:16.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we worship Jehovah and obey him,

00:18:16.643 --> 00:18:20.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can expect to get our lives enriched

00:18:20.063 --> 00:18:24.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by these wonderful things
that Jehovah gives us.

00:18:24.234 --> 00:18:27.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of the symbolic riches,
we could say,

00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:29.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can gain even now?

00:18:29.573 --> 00:18:32.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s think
about five different things.

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:36.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is in a well-known scripture
in the book of Psalms.

00:18:36.997 --> 00:18:40.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn with me to Psalm 83,

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:43.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 83.

00:18:43.253 --> 00:18:46.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to read verse 18:

00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:49.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May people know that you,

00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:53.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whose name is Jehovah, you alone

00:18:53.389 --> 00:18:57.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the Most High over all the earth.”

00:18:57.309 --> 00:18:59.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the first

00:18:59.395 --> 00:19:02.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these things that can enrich our lives?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s knowing God.

00:19:05.192 --> 00:19:09.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, many people
like to know the rich and famous,

00:19:09.363 --> 00:19:13.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just think of it, we have
the privilege of coming to know

00:19:13.034 --> 00:19:15.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Sovereign of the universe.

00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, by learning about him
and getting to know him,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our lives truly become rich.

00:19:22.377 --> 00:19:25.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in addition to that,

00:19:25.046 --> 00:19:27.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become worshippers of Jehovah.

00:19:27.757 --> 00:19:31.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that includes us
in a worldwide brotherhood

00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:36.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a brotherhood that comes
from all sorts of nations

00:19:36.224 --> 00:19:38.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and racial backgrounds and languages.

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:41.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, this global brotherhood

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:46.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is united in love
—the love of serving Jehovah God.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s something
that enriches our lives as well.

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:55.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third point is that even though
we’re living in difficult times,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we follow the advice
and direction given to us by Jehovah

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:04.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his Word, the Bible, then we
can attain a measure of happiness right now.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the Bible
gives us advice

00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:12.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to be good fathers
and mothers and children.

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:17.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can add to happiness,
love, and unity in the family.

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else that’s important

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enriches our lives:
We have hope.

00:20:23.773 --> 00:20:25.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope for the future.

00:20:25.983 --> 00:20:30.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we’re living in a world
that’s dominated by wicked people,

00:20:30.321 --> 00:20:34.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us about what’s going
to happen in the future.

00:20:34.659 --> 00:20:37.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
back to the book of Psalms.

00:20:37.704 --> 00:20:39.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time we’re going to read

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:43.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:22.

00:20:43.793 --> 00:20:46.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the promise that’s given here:

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those blessed by Him
[that is Jehovah]

00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:54.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will possess the earth,

00:20:54.846 --> 00:20:59.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those cursed by Him
will be done away with.”

00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:03.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Bible promises us that in the future

00:21:03.105 --> 00:21:05.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’ll be a big change here on earth.

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:10.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only those who love God
“will possess the earth.”

00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:12.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful hope!

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fifth point
is the wonderful promise

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible gives us that those
whom we love who have already died

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:24.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have the opportunity
of being resurrected

00:21:24.585 --> 00:21:27.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, in other words,
being brought back to life.

00:21:27.213 --> 00:21:29.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the promise of Jesus.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s recorded in John chapter 5.

00:21:33.177 --> 00:21:35.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn with me

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:40.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to John 5:28, 29.

00:21:41.978 --> 00:21:46.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jesus’ promise:
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the hour is coming in which
all those in the memorial tombs

00:21:51.112 --> 00:21:56.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will hear his voice and come out,
those who did good things

00:21:56.117 --> 00:22:00.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to a resurrection of life,
and those who practice vile things

00:22:00.872 --> 00:22:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:07.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What beautiful hopes these are

00:22:07.629 --> 00:22:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a hope for a change in the world
and a hope for those who have died

00:22:12.217 --> 00:22:15.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come back
and live again in a paradise!

00:22:15.929 --> 00:22:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the things
that can enrich our lives right now.

00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s think back
to those two individuals in the video.

00:22:25.189 --> 00:22:27.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could they change their lives

00:22:27.942 --> 00:22:32.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that instead of trying to pursue
after material riches,

00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:34.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could achieve these true riches?

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch and see.

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:46.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I hadn’t been caring

00:22:46.002 --> 00:22:48.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for myself on the inside,

00:22:48.921 --> 00:22:53.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided
to read the Bible all over again.

00:22:53.301 --> 00:22:55.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was especially moved

00:22:55.762 --> 00:22:59.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by how Jehovah repeatedly tried 
to help the Israelites

00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:02.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite all their failures.

00:23:02.352 --> 00:23:05.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminded me
that Jehovah had been expressing

00:23:05.772 --> 00:23:08.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his love for me all along.

00:23:11.236 --> 00:23:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t hold back my tears.

00:23:14.364 --> 00:23:19.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided that I’d live
the rest of my life for him.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I adjusted my work and made
the ministry the focal point in my life.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I get to share a Bible scripture

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:33.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone and see it
make an impact on them,

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel truly happy.

00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:46.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw some brothers
from the congregation

00:23:46.105 --> 00:23:50.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
playing soccer with a young boy
who had just lost his father.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were trying to comfort him
by spending time with him.

00:23:57.074 --> 00:23:59.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw them
showing personal interest in someone

00:23:59.786 --> 00:24:02.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and considering others’ feelings,

00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really impressed me and I thought,

00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:08.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want to use my time like that as well.’

00:24:08.253 --> 00:24:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture in the Bible says:

00:24:11.214 --> 00:24:14.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:24:14.717 --> 00:24:17.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I practiced it,
the happier I became.

00:24:17.178 --> 00:24:20.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became convinced
that this really is the truth.

00:24:21.975 --> 00:24:24.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when my wife and I
spend time together,

00:24:24.728 --> 00:24:27.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m better able to really understand her,

00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:30.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve come to realize
how much she means to me.

00:24:30.817 --> 00:24:34.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so thankful that Jehovah
has taught me the truth.

00:24:41.578 --> 00:24:46.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did these two individuals
gain true riches?

00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:49.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By focusing on serving Jehovah God,

00:24:49.962 --> 00:24:53.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling others the good news
about what’s in the Bible,

00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:56.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by sharing
good things with others.

00:24:56.802 --> 00:25:00.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we’ve started in a life course

00:25:00.514 --> 00:25:03.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that involves just looking
for material riches,

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:07.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too can change
and follow their example.

00:25:07.813 --> 00:25:10.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the future?

00:25:10.441 --> 00:25:13.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What true riches
are ahead of us in the future

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:18.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continue to have
a good relationship with Jehovah God?

00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:20.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to turn your attention

00:25:20.618 --> 00:25:24.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a beautiful prophecy
in the book of Revelation.

00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:29.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take your Bibles,
and turn to this book, Revelation.

00:25:29.085 --> 00:25:31.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to look at chapter 21

00:25:31.921 --> 00:25:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 3 through 5.

00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read these words,
imagine, if you would, please,

00:25:39.763 --> 00:25:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a beautiful place
the world will be

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah God
makes it into a paradise!

00:25:46.853 --> 00:25:50.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Revelation 21:3-5:

00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice
from the throne say: ‘Look!

00:25:55.988 --> 00:26:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The tent of God is with mankind,
and he will reside with them,

00:26:00.242 --> 00:26:02.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will be his people.

00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:05.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And God himself will be with them.

00:26:05.289 --> 00:26:09.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And he will wipe out
every tear from their eyes,

00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:13.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and death will be no more,
neither will mourning nor outcry

00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:15.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘nor pain be anymore.

00:26:15.424 --> 00:26:18.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The former things have passed away.’

00:26:18.553 --> 00:26:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the One seated
on the throne said: ‘Look!

00:26:21.889 --> 00:26:24.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m making all things new.’

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also he says: ‘Write,

00:26:26.644 --> 00:26:30.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these words are faithful and true.’”

00:26:30.189 --> 00:26:33.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful promise this is!

00:26:33.401 --> 00:26:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, in the future

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this earth will be turned into a paradise.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice it says ‘no more tears
and no more mourning or outcry.’

00:26:43.703 --> 00:26:47.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also notice that it says
“no more . . . pain.”

00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:52.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the blessings
that come from Jehovah God.

00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:55.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will people feel
at that particular time?

00:26:55.966 --> 00:27:00.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn our Bibles to our final scripture
in the book of Isaiah

00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:04.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 65.

00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:07.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to start reading at verse 17.

00:27:08.937 --> 00:27:13.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning of verse 17, it mentions
about the “new heavens” and “new earth”

00:27:13.943 --> 00:27:17.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is planning to bring about.

00:27:17.196 --> 00:27:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice the last part of verse 17:

00:27:21.117 --> 00:27:25.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the former things
will not be called to mind,

00:27:25.955 --> 00:27:28.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will they come up into the heart.”

00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:31.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful blessing that is!

00:27:31.294 --> 00:27:33.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something that money can’t buy.

00:27:33.588 --> 00:27:38.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, no matter what
traumatic experiences we’ve had in this life

00:27:38.593 --> 00:27:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter what pain
we’ve experienced—

00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:46.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those things will be healed,
no more pain at all.

00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:51.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful promise
from our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah!

00:27:51.481 --> 00:27:55.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, if we look down
to verses 21 through 23,

00:27:55.694 --> 00:27:59.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the activities
that people will be engaged in:

00:27:59.406 --> 00:28:02.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will build houses
and live in them,

00:28:02.242 --> 00:28:05.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:28:05.662 --> 00:28:08.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:28:08.624 --> 00:28:11.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor will they plant
for others to eat.

00:28:11.335 --> 00:28:15.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:28:15.923 --> 00:28:20.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:26.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not toil for nothing,
nor will they bear children for distress,

00:28:26.684 --> 00:28:31.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are the offspring
made up of those blessed by Jehovah,

00:28:31.689 --> 00:28:35.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their descendants with them.”

00:28:35.026 --> 00:28:38.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful time that will be!

00:28:38.988 --> 00:28:43.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can be part
of the riches that you can attain.

00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:47.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, what should be
the determination of each one of us?

00:28:47.747 --> 00:28:51.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to strive
after fake riches

00:28:51.417 --> 00:28:55.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—riches that just give
us gain with pain.

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:59.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, let us strengthen our relationship
with our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:04.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this way, we truly will
reach out for the real riches

00:29:04.431 --> 00:29:08.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those that we gain without pain!

In this part of our symposium,

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:10.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are addressing why and how

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our Bible students
overcome unclean habits.

00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:21.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first of all,
why overcome unclean habits?

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:25.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As teachers, we need to reach the heart
of those we study with,

00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:28.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand that the God we worship

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:31.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expects this to stop.

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me show you a verse
that you’re familiar with,

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:39.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of you, in Peter’s letter
—1 Peter chapter one.

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:43.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we could use these thoughts here

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:47.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endeavor to reach the heart
of those who we’re studying with,

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:51.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why this unclean habit must stop.

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 14 through 16:

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:58.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As obedient children, stop being molded

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the desires
you formerly had in your ignorance,

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:05.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but like the Holy One who called you,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become holy yourselves in all your conduct,

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:14.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for it is written:
‘You must be holy,

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:16.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I am holy.’”

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:18.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s very clear here.

00:01:18.854 --> 00:01:20.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are things

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:25.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our Bible studies practiced before

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:29.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these unclean habits in their ignorance,
before they knew Jehovah,

00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:32.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they knew his requirements.

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:36.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to understand he is the Holy One,

00:01:36.164 --> 00:01:39.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have to have their conduct line up

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:42.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Holy One that we worship.

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:44.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is not a suggestion,

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:49.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as quoting the scripture
here in verse 16, it’s a must.

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:54.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must be holy because Jehovah is holy.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in the following dramatization,

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Neeta helps her Bible student

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:05.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome an unclean habit.

00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:23.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta and I talked about it.

00:02:23.757 --> 00:02:26.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of me felt a bit scared,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
part a bit crazy.

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me knocking on doors?

00:02:33.392 --> 00:02:36.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew
this was the right thing to do.

00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A minister should also be free

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘from all nonmedical use of addictive

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:43.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or mind-altering substances.’

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:45.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonmedical?

00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:51.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking something
when I’m feeling a little stressed,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like maybe, I don’t know, a little weed

00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:00.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s OK, right?

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:04.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s for the stress.

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:11.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I didn’t quite understand
what “medical” meant.

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will we see you during the week?

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:14.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:15.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jade.

00:03:17.272 --> 00:03:19.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be back.

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:21.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can guess what
our next few studies were about.

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:25.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue
to be made new

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:27.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing it was wrong was easy.

00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:36.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Figuring out how to cope
without it wasn’t.

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:50.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beating it

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt impossible.

00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:14.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being free of it
to serve Jehovah

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt amazing!

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s discuss the “how to help.”

00:04:29.432 --> 00:04:32.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see how our Sister Neeta

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:34.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endeavored to help her Bible student

00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:37.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she became aware of that unclean habit.

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:39.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are some nice thoughts

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:42.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to how to help our Bible students

00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:45.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcome unclean habits.

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we want to be candid

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and clear from the Scriptures,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but always remember,
we need to be warm

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to be tactful with them.

00:04:57.587 --> 00:04:59.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These habits have a grip on them,

00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:04.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to display
not a judgmental attitude but patience

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:07.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, really, just imitating Jehovah,

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:11.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping them to apply Bible counsel.

00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:14.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s important for the teacher
to understand what we’re going to share

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with you next,
and then, if you have it clear,

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:22.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be able
to impart it to your Bible student.

00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read a familiar scripture

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ephesians chapter 4.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s important to understand

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we read here

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as related to helping them

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcome unclean habits

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:43.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that go contrary to Bible principles.

00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:46.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice in Ephesians chapter 4,

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:50.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 22, 23, and 24:

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:54.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You were taught
to put away the old personality

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:58.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that conforms
to your former course of conduct

00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:02.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that is being corrupted
according to its [that’s the old personality]

00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:05.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“deceptive desires.

00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:08.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:10.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in your dominant mental attitude,

00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:13.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and should put on the new personality

00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:16.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was created according to God’s will

00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in true righteousness and loyalty.”

00:06:20.383 --> 00:06:24.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to understand this clearly,

00:06:24.554 --> 00:06:27.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we need to teach our students.

00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:29.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s the old personality.

00:06:29.143 --> 00:06:33.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those of us that came in the truth
had old personalities.

00:06:33.022 --> 00:06:38.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know exactly what Paul
is writing to the Ephesians about

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that’s a former course of conduct

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:43.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is no longer acceptable.

00:06:43.575 --> 00:06:47.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the key to being able
to put on the new personality

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:52.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put away the old one
is found in verse 23:

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:56.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be made new
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:59.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does that mean?

00:06:59.717 --> 00:07:03.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means your
Bible students’ thinking

00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:06.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to change.

00:07:06.307 --> 00:07:11.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thinking has to change
into this new personality

00:07:11.312 --> 00:07:16.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—thinking that’s guided and directed
by Jehovah and his Word.

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:20.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to illustrate what I mean by that,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you a personal experience
with a Bible study that I had many years ago,

00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:29.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really appreciated
how Jehovah helped him.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:33.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I studied with him, he was 70,

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:38.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
early 70’s, and he had smoked cigarettes

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:40.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since he was eight years old.

00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:42.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s phenomenal.

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:46.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked before I became
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:46.517 --> 00:07:48.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But decades?

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So smoking had a grip on him,
that old personality,

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:58.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was very discouraging
and difficult for him.

00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:02.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he was making progress,
coming to meetings.

00:08:02.826 --> 00:08:07.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this one example
that happened with his life

00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:09.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will illustrate the point we’re making here.

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:13.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m working in a department
there at the convention,

00:08:13.378 --> 00:08:16.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s near the lobby area.

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:19.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I notice my Bible study head out,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the program is ongoing.

00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He heads out the door.

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And out of personal interest
(not to police him)

00:08:26.434 --> 00:08:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to go see; is he OK?

00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:32.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he’s about a block down

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the lobby of the convention center,

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you know what?

00:08:37.154 --> 00:08:39.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smoking a cigarette.

00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:42.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he notices me come up behind him,

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just hits him, and he’s contrite.

00:08:46.122 --> 00:08:48.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The shame is all in his face,

00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:52.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he throws that cigarette down
and stomps it with his shoe.

00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I get close to him, he says:

00:08:54.964 --> 00:08:58.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I just— I’ve been asking Jehovah,
‘Forgive me; forgive me.’

00:08:58.927 --> 00:09:02.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When this happens,
I always ask him to forgive me.”

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said: “Well, that’s commendable.

00:09:04.683 --> 00:09:07.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s so important.
I know you love Jehovah.

“However, here’s what you need to learn.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:15.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“See, you need to approach Jehovah before,

00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:18.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplicate him

00:09:18.531 --> 00:09:22.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you take that cigarette.”

00:09:22.243 --> 00:09:24.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where
our Bible students need help.

00:09:24.913 --> 00:09:29.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important that they
have to supplicate Jehovah

00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:32.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before that unclean habit overwhelms them.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m happy to say he did.

00:09:36.926 --> 00:09:38.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned his back on that.

00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:41.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He supplicated Jehovah.

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:44.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And boy, imagine smoking all those decades,

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:48.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he died a faithful servant
of Jehovah God.

00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So help your Bible students.

00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:55.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep that in mind;
they have to change their thinking,

00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s our responsibility
to make that clear to them.

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:03.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, teach them too
by means of practical assistance.

00:10:03.204 --> 00:10:07.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be a dear friend for them;
stay there for them.

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:11.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be available when they need help
with something, and just love them.

00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:13.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be judgmental.

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:18.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be supportive, and help them
to overcome these unclean habits.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And very important,
teach them,

00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:25.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not give up.’
Jehovah loves you.

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:29.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He wants you to rejoice
in the progress you’re making.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loves you.”

00:10:31.192 --> 00:10:33.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what you’ll experience

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:36.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they become a dedicated Witness,

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:38.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your fellow servant of God,

00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:42.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have a friend forever.

00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:48.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, next on our symposium, the final talk,

00:10:48.585 --> 00:10:51.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson,

00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:54.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
is going to consider the talk

00:10:54.258 --> 00:10:57.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students to Develop

00:10:57.094 --> 00:11:00.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Personal Relationship With Jehovah.”

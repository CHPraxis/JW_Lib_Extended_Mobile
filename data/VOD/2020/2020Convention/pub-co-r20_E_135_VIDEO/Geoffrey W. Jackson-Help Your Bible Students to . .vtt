00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does a father feel

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he receives
an unexpected gift from his child?

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, his heart is warmed.

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:14.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he sees this
as an expression of the child’s love for him.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:24.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way,
our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:27.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not want
to force us to serve him.

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s interested in our motives,

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:33.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to serve him out of love.

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah
realizes that love has power.

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:43.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives us the power
to make changes in our life.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, it helps us

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:49.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to overcome
temptations and opposition.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:54.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that presents a challenge for us
when we’re conducting Bible studies.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:56.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:02.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we develop
within the hearts of the Bible students

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a love for Jehovah

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:08.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without forcing them
or trying to put pressure on them?

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s something
that we need to think about.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:17.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these talks, we’ve certainly enjoyed
this series of videos—haven’t we?—

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have helped us to see
how Jade has made progress

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:26.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with her Bible study and how Neeta
has helped her all along.

00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:29.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about this, we see

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jade has made good progress

00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:35.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she’s up to a point now

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where she has a love for Jehovah.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:43.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this final video, let’s watch how Jade

00:01:43.422 --> 00:01:46.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faces a very difficult problem

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll see how her love for Jehovah
helps her to overcome this problem.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Mum, listen.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jade, you listen!

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t this just another
one of your phases?

00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:01.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to move on, Love.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:04.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holidays are our time.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all I get from you.

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:09.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise me you’ll be here.

00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise!

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:31.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really don’t want to disappoint her,

00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:33.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t disappoint Jehovah.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:35.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You love them both.

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you think he can help you?

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to him.

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:52.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent a long time
pouring out my heart to him.

00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remembered something
from one of the Psalms:

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:12.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will walk in your truth.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:17.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart
to fear your name.”

00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:08.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

00:04:11.538 --> 00:04:14.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember someone once claiming
to be “all about the promises.”

00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Made any good ones lately?

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:19.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:27.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that certainly was
a difficult problem, wasn’t it?

00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her mother wanted to force her
to join her in a worldly holiday.

00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped Jade?

00:04:35.438 --> 00:04:38.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As she said, it’s true
that she loves her mother

00:04:38.817 --> 00:04:42.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she didn’t want
to disappoint Jehovah.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, Neeta didn’t try to go through
all the pros and cons with her.

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:49.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She realized that Jade
had a love for Jehovah,

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:52.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she just simply said,
‘Ask him for help.’

00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah did help her.

00:04:55.835 --> 00:05:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we make sure
that our Bible students

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to a similar point in their life,
where they love Jehovah?

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:08.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we find some help
with regard to that question

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:10.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we turn to the first book of John.

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, please, turn with me
to 1 John chapter 4,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 8:

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever does not love
has not come to know God,

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because God is love.”

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is this telling us?

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:32.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, basically, it is saying
that if our Bible student

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t love God,

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s because they
haven’t really come to know God yet.

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:41.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we turn the page to verse 19,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a secondary point that’s mentioned.

00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:46.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “We love,

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:50.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he first loved us.”

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:52.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this highlight?

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:55.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for our Bible student to love Jehovah,

00:05:55.732 --> 00:05:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they need to come to know him
but also they need

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see his love in their lives.

00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:05.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that puts a responsibility on us

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:08.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them to identify Jehovah’s love

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:13.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then have this love
for Jehovah build in their hearts.

00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:16.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do that by asking questions, such as:

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How have you seen
Jehovah’s love in your life?”

00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:23.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “What does this Bible account
teach us about Jehovah’s love?”

00:06:23.428 --> 00:06:28.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, although we
are interested in explaining

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:31.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah has done
by highlighting what he does,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he does it, and when he does it,

00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:37.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never want
to forget the vital question:

00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:39.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does he do something?

00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:42.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is, because of his love.

00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:46.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we help our Bible student to see that.

00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:51.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah’s power
enables him to do things.

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:54.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wisdom helps him and guides him,

00:06:54.085 --> 00:06:58.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with justice,
to do things the right way.

00:06:58.048 --> 00:07:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is it that motivates Jehovah?

00:07:01.844 --> 00:07:04.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s his love, isn’t it?

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And asking the question
why Jehovah does things

00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps to highlight that point.

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:15.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we’re teaching our Bible students,
we need them to see

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really does love them

00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:21.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants them
to succeed in their life.

00:07:21.072 --> 00:07:23.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we could perhaps share with them

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the times when we personally
have experienced Jehovah’s love

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:31.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps in the way
that Jehovah has answered our prayers.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:36.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in connection with this,
there’s another scripture that can help us.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to the book of Isaiah

00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:43.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 48,
and we’re going to look 

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at verses 17 and 18.

00:07:48.518 --> 00:07:53.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17, 18:

00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:57.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,
your Repurchaser,

00:07:57.278 --> 00:08:01.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Holy One of Israel:
‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:05.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:08.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If only you would pay attention
to my commandments!

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:16.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Then your peace would become
just like a river

00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:20.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your righteousness
like the waves of the sea.’”

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:23.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the point
that’s being made here?

00:08:23.848 --> 00:08:27.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to help
our Bible students to understand

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really wants the best for them

00:08:30.438 --> 00:08:34.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s helping and guiding them
in the way that they should go.

00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:38.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the end result
—we notice there in verse 18—

00:08:38.238 --> 00:08:42.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that peace and righteousness
will be their reward.

00:08:42.117 --> 00:08:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this truly is something
that can help the Bible student.

00:08:46.789 --> 00:08:50.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when they start to face the changes

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:54.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they need to make in life
if they have this love for Jehovah,

00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they won’t just view it
as something they have to do

00:08:57.258 --> 00:09:00.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to attain everlasting life.

00:09:00.553 --> 00:09:03.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they’ll view these things

00:09:03.848 --> 00:09:08.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as opportunities for them
to prove their love of Jehovah.

00:09:09.896 --> 00:09:13.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what has this symposium shown?

00:09:13.567 --> 00:09:17.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve listened to the various talks
and watched the videos,

00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:20.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s helped us to see
various ways that we can help

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible students to make progress.

00:09:23.536 --> 00:09:27.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realize that conducting
a Bible study and helping

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:30.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone to become a disciple

00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:33.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not just a matter of reading
certain paragraphs in a book

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or using certain techniques;
a lot more is involved.

00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else?

00:09:40.596 --> 00:09:44.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember that the apostle Paul
was an experienced disciple-maker.

00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:49.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s turn our Bibles
to the first book of Thessalonians,

00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll notice here
that under inspiration,

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:55.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul tells us
what else is involved.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Thessalonians chapter 2

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 7 and 8:

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:07.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

00:10:07.124 --> 00:10:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as when a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.

00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:14.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:10:14.173 --> 00:10:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,
not only the good news of God

00:10:18.928 --> 00:10:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also our very selves,

00:10:22.098 --> 00:10:25.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:30.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we really need to care for these ones.

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:33.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to nurture them

00:10:33.277 --> 00:10:37.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(help them) with the problems
and obstacles they face along the way.

00:10:37.364 --> 00:10:40.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, yes, we need to become their friends.

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:46.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, becoming a disciple-maker
is a challenging work.

00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:50.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a lot involved with it,
but don’t feel overwhelmed.

00:10:50.462 --> 00:10:53.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do it with Jehovah’s help

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the help of Jesus Christ.

00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:58.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember when Jesus gave us a commission

00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:02.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and make disciples,
what else did he say?

00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:04.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!
I am with you.”

00:11:04.685 --> 00:11:08.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, with Jehovah’s help
and with the help of Jesus,

00:11:08.231 --> 00:11:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can experience a wonderful joy.

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:13.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that joy?

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:18.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy of seeing a new disciple
learn to love Jehovah.

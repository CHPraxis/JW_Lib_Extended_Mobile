WEBVTT

00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy
to have hundreds of thousands of children

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
associated
with our congregations worldwide.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be assured Jehovah loves
every one of those children.

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:17.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we say that?

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one reason is that every child
owes their name to Jehovah God

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:26.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’s the Originator
of life and, in fact,

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:29.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Originator
of the family unit as well.

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:32.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was in heaven,
he recognized

00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:36.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and observed
Jehovah’s intense love for children.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jesus
walked the earth,

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:43.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reflected
those same qualities toward children.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The psalmist
beautifully expresses

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:49.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s feelings
about children

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the 127th Psalm
and verse 3.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:55.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read that

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:58.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 127:3.

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:03.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Look!

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sons are an inheritance
from Jehovah;

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fruit of the womb
is a reward.”

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not only are our children
a blessing, or “a reward,”

00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:20.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scripture indicates
that they “are an inheritance” as well.

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they are a gift
to you from Jehovah.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person who hopes
to inherit something

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:30.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually prepare
to receive it

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:33.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then takes good care
of it afterward.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:38.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that’s exactly what you parents
want to do with your children.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, children
can bring much joy;

00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:44.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can
also cause frustration.

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:49.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question is:
How can you find joy in your children

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:52.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite living in a stressful world?

00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:58.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One suggestion
is to view your children

00:01:58.144 --> 00:02:00.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way Jehovah does.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are special gifts
to you from him.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love them;
make them feel loved.

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:11.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not enough for you
to know you love your own children.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to know it.

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:17.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will not know it
unless you find ways

00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:20.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show your love to them.

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as with any gift,
there’s a responsibility to take care of it.

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:28.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we go back
to the 127th Psalm,

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the illustration
that King Solomon uses

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to explain this responsibility.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:38.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in verses 4 and 5.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 127:4, 5,

00:02:44.234 --> 00:02:48.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Like arrows
in the hand of a mighty man,

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so are the sons of one’s youth.

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:54.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is the man who fills
his quiver with them.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will not be put to shame.”

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:01.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So children
are likened to arrows

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and parents
to mighty warriors.

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:06.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a warrior
will take the arrow

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will carefully aim it
so he hits the target.

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the same
with you parents.

00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:17.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage you,
carefully direct your children

00:03:17.352 --> 00:03:20.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that,
so to speak, you “hit the target”

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:24.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so your children
can have a happy, fulfilling life

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:27.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving Jehovah God.

00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:30.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help
you to do that?

00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:33.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah
to help you build

00:03:33.411 --> 00:03:37.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintain a strong relationship
with your children.

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:40.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This closeness
will help them

00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to respond favorably
to your good direction.

00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:48.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the way you treat
your children is going to affect

00:03:48.844 --> 00:03:53.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only their future
but your happiness as well.

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:57.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are five suggestions
that might be of assistance

00:03:57.561 --> 00:03:59.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in building and maintaining

00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:02.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this strong relationship
with your children.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one:

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell your children
you love them.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:11.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say,
“Well, that’s not the way I was raised.”

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe not.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:16.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But learn from the example
of Jehovah God

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:20.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah
openly expressed his affection

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:22.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his Son, Jesus.

00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:24.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no matter how
you were brought up,

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:27.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn to express openly

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:30.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your feelings
toward your children.

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:33.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One father said this:

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:38.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have found that children
are a bit like some flowers.

00:04:38.813 --> 00:04:42.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as these little plants
turn toward the sun

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to receive light and warmth,
children look to their parents

00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for love
and for reassurance

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are
welcome members of the family.”

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:57.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t make your children
have to ask you,

00:04:57.165 --> 00:04:59.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, Dad,
do you love me?”

00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:02.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, on a regular basis,

00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:06.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your words support the fact
that you love them.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another way to build
a strong relationship with your children is:

00:05:13.265 --> 00:05:16.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give them your time.

00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:19.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s going to be a challenge
in the world we’re living in now.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t you think your children
are worth meeting that challenge?

00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:27.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to require
good organization on your part

00:05:27.697 --> 00:05:30.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even
making some sacrifices

00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:33.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—giving up some things
that you enjoy doing.

00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:37.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But spend a lot of time
talking to your children,

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:42.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eating with your children,
playing with your children.

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s up to you parents
to figure out

00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:50.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you can give
your time to your children.

00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:53.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mother once asked
her children,

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:57.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you could have
anything you wanted,

00:05:57.061 --> 00:05:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you like most?”

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four responded,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“More time
with Mom and Dad.”

00:06:06.154 --> 00:06:10.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, show your children
how important

00:06:10.325 --> 00:06:14.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are to you
by spending time with them.

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:16.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know,
there’s more that’s necessary

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than just to be
physically around them.

00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:22.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That leads us
to our third suggestion:

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:27.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to your children
and acknowledge their feelings.

00:06:27.218 --> 00:06:29.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when communicating
with your children,

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:32.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t dominate
the conversations.

00:06:32.223 --> 00:06:34.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let them talk.

00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen carefully
and respectfully.

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:40.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to understand
how they feel.

00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:44.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they express themselves
and their emotions and their thoughts

00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:47.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and sometimes,
maybe in extreme terms),

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:51.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t respond in a similar way.

00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 16:23 says:

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:59.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart of the wise one
gives his mouth insight.”

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So parents, work hard

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:05.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at patiently trying
to understand why your child

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feels the way they do
and how you can be of help.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:13.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One father expressed
the matter this way,

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:19.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since Jehovah allows me
to pour out my heart to him in prayer,

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think it is only fair
that I allow my children

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to pour out their positive

00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:29.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>and</i> negative feelings to me.”

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:32.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also listen to your children

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:35.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and acknowledge their feelings.

00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:37.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fourth suggestion

00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:42.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may help to maintain
a strong relationship with your children is:

00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:46.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not expect
them to be adults.

00:07:46.468 --> 00:07:50.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the Bible says:
‘Through <i>use</i>

00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:53.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘a person’s perceptive powers
are trained

00:07:53.892 --> 00:07:57.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distinguish
between right and wrong.’

00:07:57.354 --> 00:07:59.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s going to take time.

00:07:59.857 --> 00:08:03.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also speaks
of the “traits of a babe,”

00:08:03.778 --> 00:08:06.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “foolishness” of boyhood,

00:08:06.948 --> 00:08:10.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the “vanity” of adolescence.

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:14.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as your children
are going through these various stages,

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognize their limitations

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t expect them
to be little adults.

00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:23.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fifth suggestion:

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When disciplining your children,

00:08:26.343 --> 00:08:29.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always show love
and discernment.

00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:34.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is supported
by Ephesians 6:4

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:39.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there it tells parents
‘not to be irritating your children,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘but to bring them up
in the discipline

00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:44.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and admonition of Jehovah.’

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:48.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no secret formula
on how to accomplish this,

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially
since every child is different.

00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:55.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So parents,
we encourage you, give thought

00:08:55.457 --> 00:08:57.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the manner of your discipline,

00:08:57.876 --> 00:09:01.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always showing love
and discernment.

00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:04.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are five suggestion

00:09:04.842 --> 00:09:09.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help you to build
a strong relationship with your children

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:14.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help them to respond
to your good training.

00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:19.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what effect
will that have upon you parents?

00:09:19.732 --> 00:09:21.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, please read with me

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs chapter 23,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 24 and 25

00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:32.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 23:24, 25.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:38.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The father of a righteous one
will surely be joyful;

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:43.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whoever fathers a wise son
will rejoice in him.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your father
and your mother will rejoice,

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:50.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she who gave birth
to you will be joyful.”

00:09:50.848 --> 00:09:54.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the greatest joy
that a parent can have

00:09:54.936 --> 00:09:58.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to see their children
turn out to be righteous

00:09:58.773 --> 00:10:02.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wise servants
of Jehovah God.

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:06.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to take time and effort
on your part to accomplish that.

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we encourage you,
don’t give up

00:10:09.493 --> 00:10:14.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on these precious gifts
that you have received from Jehovah.

00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:17.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the parents
rejoice in their children.

00:10:23.591 --> 00:10:25.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:27.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:30.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Showtime!

00:10:30.682 --> 00:10:33.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fire drill went off right
when we were having our math test.

00:10:33.184 --> 00:10:35.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, Dad!
I’ve got to shower before our study.

00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:42.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Girls.

00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:42.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey.

00:10:42.986 --> 00:10:44.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to finish the kitchen now.

00:10:44.488 --> 00:10:46.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we don’t have any time;
we just got home.

00:10:46.532 --> 00:10:47.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we have to leave in 15 minutes.

00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:50.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No discussion, no excuses.
Now!

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:53.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:11:00.087 --> 00:11:02.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did tell them to leave
the kitchen spotless, didn’t I?

00:11:05.677 --> 00:11:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:10.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed to hear that.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:17.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just overall they are . . .

00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:21.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know. I know.

00:11:23.737 --> 00:11:26.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were auxiliary pioneering
during the circuit overseer’s visit.

00:11:28.534 --> 00:11:32.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really
put themselves out for others

00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:43.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including you—I mean, us.

00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:07.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t ever want
to take them for granted.

00:12:10.953 --> 00:12:12.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, girls,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the big mess earlier,

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks for cleaning that up.

00:12:17.335 --> 00:12:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mom and I, we were upset.

00:12:21.423 --> 00:12:26.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we really want you to know that, um . . .

00:12:26.428 --> 00:12:31.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . you are gifts from Jehovah
precious gifts we both cherish.

00:12:31.308 --> 00:12:34.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What your Mom said.

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:49.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the parents
rejoiced in their children?

00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:53.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the daughters needed
some counsel and some discipline,

00:12:53.748 --> 00:12:57.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it didn’t overshadow
all their good qualities.

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:59.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, but these parents
made comments

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:03.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like they never wanted
to take the girls for granted

00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:06.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they cherished
these girls.

00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:10.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they openly expressed
that they loved them.

00:13:10.015 --> 00:13:14.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it was apparent
this family had cultivated joy.

00:13:14.854 --> 00:13:19.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re confident

at cultivating joy
in your family.

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:24.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some things that will help you

00:13:24.864 --> 00:13:28.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to be sure to tell
your children you love them,

give them your time,
listen to them,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
acknowledge their feelings,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t expect them
to be adults,

00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:42.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and train them
with love and discernment.

00:13:42.424 --> 00:13:45.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These suggestions
are going to help you

00:00:02 We’re very happy to have hundreds of thousands of children
00:00:07 associated with our congregations worldwide.
00:00:10 You can be assured Jehovah loves every one of those children.
00:00:15 Well, how can we say that?
00:00:17 Well, one reason is that every child owes their name to Jehovah God
00:00:22 because he’s the Originator of life and, in fact,
00:00:26 the Originator of the family unit as well.
00:00:29 When Jesus was in heaven, he recognized
00:00:32 and observed Jehovah’s intense love for children.
00:00:36 And when Jesus walked the earth,
00:00:39 he reflected those same qualities toward children.
00:00:43 The psalmist beautifully expresses
00:00:47 Jehovah’s feelings about children
00:00:49 in the 127th Psalm and verse 3.
00:00:53 Well, let’s read that
00:00:55 —Psalm 127:3.
00:01:01 It says: “Look!
00:01:03 “Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah;
00:01:06 the fruit of the womb is a reward.”
00:01:10 So not only are our children a blessing, or “a reward,”
00:01:15 the scripture indicates that they “are an inheritance” as well.
00:01:20 Yes, they are a gift to you from Jehovah.
00:01:24 A person who hopes to inherit something
00:01:27 usually prepare to receive it
00:01:30 and then takes good care of it afterward.
00:01:33 I’m sure that’s exactly what you parents want to do with your children.
00:01:38 Well, children can bring much joy;
00:01:41 they can also cause frustration.
00:01:44 So the question is: How can you find joy in your children
00:01:49 despite living in a stressful world?
00:01:54 One suggestion is to view your children
00:01:58 the way Jehovah does.
00:02:00 These are special gifts to you from him.
00:02:04 Love them; make them feel loved.
00:02:08 It’s not enough for you to know you love your own children.
00:02:11 They need to know it.
00:02:13 They will not know it unless you find ways
00:02:17 to show your love to them.
00:02:20 And as with any gift, there’s a responsibility to take care of it.
00:02:25 If we go back to the 127th Psalm,
00:02:28 notice the illustration that King Solomon uses
00:02:32 to explain this responsibility.
00:02:35 It’s in verses 4 and 5.
00:02:38 Psalm 127:4, 5,
00:02:44 it says: “Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
00:02:48 “so are the sons of one’s youth.
00:02:50 “Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them.
00:02:54 They will not be put to shame.”
00:02:58 So children are likened to arrows
00:03:01 and parents to mighty warriors.
00:03:04 So a warrior will take the arrow
00:03:06 and he will carefully aim it so he hits the target.
00:03:10 Well, it’s the same with you parents.
00:03:13 We encourage you, carefully direct your children
00:03:17 in a way that, so to speak, you “hit the target”
00:03:20 so your children can have a happy, fulfilling life
00:03:24 of serving Jehovah God.
00:03:27 So, what can help you to do that?
00:03:30 Pray to Jehovah to help you build
00:03:33 and maintain a strong relationship with your children.
00:03:37 This closeness will help them
00:03:40 to respond favorably to your good direction.
00:03:44 Yes, the way you treat your children is going to affect
00:03:48 not only their future but your happiness as well.
00:03:53 Now, there are five suggestions that might be of assistance
00:03:57 in building and maintaining
00:03:59 this strong relationship with your children.
00:04:02 The first one:
00:04:05 Tell your children you love them.
00:04:08 You might say, “Well, that’s not the way I was raised.”
00:04:11 Well, maybe not.
00:04:13 But learn from the example of Jehovah God
00:04:16 because Jehovah openly expressed his affection
00:04:20 for his Son, Jesus.
00:04:22 And no matter how you were brought up,
00:04:24 learn to express openly
00:04:27 your feelings toward your children.
00:04:30 One father said this:
00:04:33 “I have found that children are a bit like some flowers.
00:04:38 “Just as these little plants turn toward the sun
00:04:42 “to receive light and warmth, children look to their parents
00:04:46 “for love and for reassurance
00:04:49 that they are welcome members of the family.”
00:04:53 Don’t make your children have to ask you,
00:04:57 “Mom, Dad, do you love me?”
00:04:59 No, on a regular basis,
00:05:02 let your words support the fact that you love them.
00:05:08 Now, another way to build a strong relationship with your children is:
00:05:13 Give them your time.
00:05:16 That’s going to be a challenge in the world we’re living in now.
00:05:19 But don’t you think your children are worth meeting that challenge?
00:05:23 It’s going to require good organization on your part
00:05:27 and maybe even making some sacrifices
00:05:30 —giving up some things that you enjoy doing.
00:05:33 But spend a lot of time talking to your children,
00:05:37 eating with your children, playing with your children.
00:05:42 It’s up to you parents to figure out
00:05:46 how you can give your time to your children.
00:05:50 A mother once asked her children,
00:05:53 “If you could have anything you wanted,
00:05:57 what would you like most?”
00:05:59 All four responded,
00:06:02 “More time with Mom and Dad.”
00:06:06 Yes, show your children how important
00:06:10 they are to you by spending time with them.
00:06:14 But, you know, there’s more that’s necessary
00:06:16 than just to be physically around them.
00:06:19 That leads us to our third suggestion:
00:06:22 Listen to your children and acknowledge their feelings.
00:06:27 So when communicating with your children,
00:06:29 don’t dominate the conversations.
00:06:32 Let them talk.
00:06:34 Listen carefully and respectfully.
00:06:37 Try to understand how they feel.
00:06:40 And when they express themselves and their emotions and their thoughts
00:06:44 (and sometimes, maybe in extreme terms),
00:06:47 don’t respond in a similar way.
00:06:51 Proverbs 16:23 says:
00:06:54 “The heart of the wise one gives his mouth insight.”
00:06:59 So parents, work hard
00:07:02 at patiently trying to understand why your child
00:07:05 feels the way they do and how you can be of help.
00:07:09 One father expressed the matter this way,
00:07:15 “Since Jehovah allows me to pour out my heart to him in prayer,
00:07:19 “I think it is only fair that I allow my children
00:07:22 “to pour out their positive
00:07:25 and negative feelings to me.”
00:07:29 Also listen to your children
00:07:32 and acknowledge their feelings.
00:07:35 Now, the fourth suggestion
00:07:37 that may help to maintain a strong relationship with your children is:
00:07:42 Do not expect them to be adults.
00:07:46 Remember, the Bible says: ‘Through use
00:07:50 ‘a person’s perceptive powers are trained
00:07:53 to distinguish between right and wrong.’
00:07:57 Well, that’s going to take time.
00:07:59 The Bible also speaks of the “traits of a babe,”
00:08:03 the “foolishness” of boyhood,
00:08:06 and the “vanity” of adolescence.
00:08:10 So as your children are going through these various stages,
00:08:14 recognize their limitations
00:08:17 and don’t expect them to be little adults.
00:08:20 Now, the fifth suggestion:
00:08:23 When disciplining your children,
00:08:26 always show love and discernment.
00:08:29 Now, this is supported by Ephesians 6:4
00:08:34 because there it tells parents ‘not to be irritating your children,
00:08:39 ‘but to bring them up in the discipline
00:08:42 and admonition of Jehovah.’
00:08:44 So there’s no secret formula on how to accomplish this,
00:08:48 especially since every child is different.
00:08:52 So parents, we encourage you, give thought
00:08:55 to the manner of your discipline,
00:08:57 always showing love and discernment.
00:09:01 So there are five suggestion
00:09:04 that will help you to build a strong relationship with your children
00:09:09 that will help them to respond to your good training.
00:09:16 Now, what effect will that have upon you parents?
00:09:19 Well, please read with me
00:09:21 Proverbs chapter 23,
00:09:24 verses 24 and 25
00:09:28 —Proverbs 23:24, 25.
00:09:34 It says: “The father of a righteous one will surely be joyful;
00:09:38 “whoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him.
00:09:43 “Your father and your mother will rejoice,
00:09:46 and she who gave birth to you will be joyful.”
00:09:50 So the greatest joy that a parent can have
00:09:54 is to see their children turn out to be righteous
00:09:58 and wise servants of Jehovah God.
00:10:02 It’s going to take time and effort on your part to accomplish that.
00:10:06 But we encourage you, don’t give up
00:10:09 on these precious gifts that you have received from Jehovah.
00:10:14 As you watch the following dramatization,
00:10:17 notice how the parents rejoice in their children.
00:10:23 Thank you. I love you.
00:10:25 I love you too.
00:10:29 Showtime!
00:10:30 So the fire drill went off right when we were having our math test.
00:10:33 Hey, Mom, Dad! I’ve got to shower before our study.
00:10:41 Girls.
00:10:42 Oh, hey.
00:10:42 You need to finish the kitchen now.
00:10:44 No, we don’t have any time; we just got home.
00:10:46 Yeah, we have to leave in 15 minutes.
00:10:47 No discussion, no excuses. Now!
00:10:51 OK.
00:11:00 Thanks.
00:11:02 I did tell them to leave the kitchen spotless, didn’t I?
00:11:05 Yeah.
00:11:08 They needed to hear that.
00:11:10 True.
00:11:13 It’s just overall they are . . .
00:11:17 I know. I know.
00:11:23 They were auxiliary pioneering during the circuit overseer’s visit.
00:11:28 They really put themselves out for others
00:11:38 including you—I mean, us.
00:12:05 I don’t ever want to take them for granted.
00:12:10 Um, girls,
00:12:12 about the big mess earlier,
00:12:15 thanks for cleaning that up.
00:12:17 Your mom and I, we were upset.
00:12:21 But we really want you to know that, um . . .
00:12:26 . . . you are gifts from Jehovah precious gifts we both cherish.
00:12:31 We love you very much.
00:12:34 What your Mom said.
00:12:46 Did you notice how the parents rejoiced in their children?
00:12:49 Even though the daughters needed some counsel and some discipline,
00:12:53 it didn’t overshadow all their good qualities.
00:12:57 No, but these parents made comments
00:12:59 like they never wanted to take the girls for granted
00:13:03 and they cherished these girls.
00:13:06 In fact, they openly expressed that they loved them.
00:13:10 Now, it was apparent this family had cultivated joy.
00:13:14 And we’re confident that you as parents also are working hard
00:13:19 at cultivating joy in your family.
00:13:22 Some things that will help you
00:13:24 are to be sure to tell your children you love them,
00:13:28 give them your time, listen to them,
00:13:32 acknowledge their feelings,
00:13:35 don’t expect them to be adults,
00:13:37 and train them with love and discernment.
00:13:42 These suggestions are going to help you
00:13:45 to aim your children
00:13:47 to an everlasting future of serving Jehovah God.
00:13:51 And as you put forth all of this effort to assist your children,
00:13:56 you will be able to rejoice in them
00:13:59 —these precious gifts
00:14:01 that you have inherited from Jehovah.
00:14:06 Brother Ronald Curzan, a helper to the Teaching Committee,
00:14:10 will now present the final talk of this symposium,
00:14:14 “Cultivate Joy in Your Family
00:14:16 —Young Ones, Rejoice in Your Parents.”

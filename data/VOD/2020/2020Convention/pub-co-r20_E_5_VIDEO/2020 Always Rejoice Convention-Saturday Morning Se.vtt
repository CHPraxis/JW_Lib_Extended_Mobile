Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today’s session will begin
with a music-video presentation.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:13.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have a cellular telephone
or other electronic device,

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please adjust it to a setting
that will not disturb others.

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now encourage you to watch
and listen to the music-video presentation,

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which shows the joy
that comes from disciple-making.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy!

00:10:16.424 --> 00:10:18.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the next session of this

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:22.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always Rejoice”! Regional Convention!

00:10:22.274 --> 00:10:26.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this session and the next one,
you will hear the talks listed

00:10:26.913 --> 00:10:29.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the Saturday heading
of your printed program.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture theme for today’s program

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:35.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is taken from Psalm 105:3,

00:10:35.229 --> 00:10:39.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we read: “Boast about his holy name.

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:44.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts
of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will focus on improving
our skills as disciple-makers,

00:10:48.518 --> 00:10:53.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will see how
the disciple-making work leads to joy.

00:10:53.074 --> 00:10:56.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now invite all to stand
and share in singing

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
song number 53,
entitled “Preparing to Preach.”

00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:03.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song, you may pause the program

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:06.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask Jehovah for his blessing
on our day’s activity.

00:11:06.697 --> 00:11:09.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 53.

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated.

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:58.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make disciples, we must be
effective preachers and teachers.

00:13:58.789 --> 00:14:02.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you stimulate interest
in the Kingdom message

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:05.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then help that interest to grow?

00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first symposium of this session
will consider six necessary skills.

00:14:10.406 --> 00:14:13.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will introduce the one to follow.

00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:16.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give your attention
to Brother David Schafer,

00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:18.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee.

00:14:18.722 --> 00:14:23.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will begin with the theme
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:27.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills—
Asking Questions.”

00:14:33.976 --> 00:14:38.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel
about doing things that you do well?

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:42.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever noticed that people
who are experts at what they do

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seem to enjoy the job, whatever it is,

00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:47.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they delight in training others?

00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:52.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is because the more people there are
who understand how to support a project,

00:14:52.531 --> 00:14:54.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make music, or play a game,

00:14:54.913 --> 00:14:58.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more enjoyable it is
when we combine forces as a group,

00:14:58.465 --> 00:15:01.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a team, an orchestra.

00:15:01.056 --> 00:15:06.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a direct correlation
between skill and joy.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:11.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you feel
about the work of making disciples?

00:15:11.044 --> 00:15:14.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Luke chapter 10.

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:18.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus loved making disciples.

00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:21.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 40:8 says
prophetically concerning Jesus:

00:15:21.617 --> 00:15:26.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To do your will,
O my God, is my delight.”

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice here
that Luke 10:21 tells us

00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when Jesus was contemplating the results
of a particular preaching campaign,

00:15:35.658 --> 00:15:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he became overjoyed

00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:42.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[overjoyed] in the holy spirit.”

00:15:42.303 --> 00:15:47.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was a masterful teacher,
but as this chapter of the Bible shows,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped his disciples
to become skillful as well.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thus, as pointed out
at Luke 10:17,

00:15:55.383 --> 00:15:58.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they also found joy in this work.

00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:00.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our joy grows

00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:04.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we work to improve our skills.

00:16:04.117 --> 00:16:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this symposium
will discuss six essential skills

00:16:08.547 --> 00:16:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to become
not just more effective preachers

00:16:12.642 --> 00:16:15.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but effective disciple-makers.

00:16:15.693 --> 00:16:18.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What skills are required?

00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:22.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see them listed on your program:
asking questions,

00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:27.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unleashing the power of God’s Word,
illustrating key points,

00:16:27.352 --> 00:16:30.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaching with enthusiasm,
showing empathy,

00:16:30.445 --> 00:16:33.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reaching the heart.

00:16:33.036 --> 00:16:36.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium includes
a series of dramatizations

00:16:36.755 --> 00:16:39.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that follow the progress
of one Bible student.

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After each video, we’ll discuss

00:16:41.644 --> 00:16:44.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the skill that was featured
and how we can use it.

00:16:44.862 --> 00:16:48.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will help us to experience more joy

00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:50.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our disciple-making work.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready?

00:16:52.426 --> 00:16:56.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss our first skill:
asking questions.

00:16:56.313 --> 00:16:58.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we ask questions?

00:16:58.987 --> 00:17:01.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions serve a number of purposes.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we pose them just to stimulate
interest and to get the conversation rolling.

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:10.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times, we’re interested
in hearing how a person thinks

00:17:10.271 --> 00:17:13.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can know better
how to direct the conversation.

00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:18.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Matthew chapter 22.

00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:20.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew what was in man.

00:17:20.969 --> 00:17:24.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could read hearts,
so he didn’t need people

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tell him where they
stood on certain issues.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:31.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, he used questions
to encourage his listeners

00:17:31.124 --> 00:17:34.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reason things out for themselves.

00:17:34.384 --> 00:17:36.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how he did that here

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:41.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 22:41-45:

00:17:43.452 --> 00:17:47.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now while the Pharisees
were gathered together, Jesus asked them:

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What do you think about the Christ?

00:17:50.514 --> 00:17:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whose son is he?’

00:17:53.189 --> 00:17:55.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They said to him: ‘David’s.’

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He asked them: ‘How is it, then,

00:17:59.123 --> 00:18:02.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that David under inspiration
calls him Lord,

00:18:02.466 --> 00:18:05.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘saying,
“Jehovah said to my Lord:

00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:09.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Sit at my right hand until I put
your enemies beneath your feet”?

00:18:09.863 --> 00:18:13.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If, then, David calls him Lord,

00:18:13.206 --> 00:18:16.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how is he his son?’”

00:18:16.215 --> 00:18:18.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Four questions.

00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:21.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wouldn’t it have been easier

00:18:21.439 --> 00:18:24.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and quicker just to tell
people the answers?

00:18:24.657 --> 00:18:27.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, but those questions

00:18:27.624 --> 00:18:32.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led honesthearted ones to draw
accurate conclusions for themselves

00:18:32.054 --> 00:18:36.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time revealing
the true motives of opposers.

00:18:36.776 --> 00:18:40.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions are powerful.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:42.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we use them,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should keep in mind
the words of James 1:19.

00:18:46.597 --> 00:18:50.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what this says
—James 1:19:

00:18:50.441 --> 00:18:53.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Know this, my beloved brothers:

00:18:53.994 --> 00:18:57.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone must be quick to listen,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
slow to speak, slow to anger.”

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:05.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To ask a question
without waiting for the answer

00:19:05.695 --> 00:19:08.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be like making an appointment
to meet a friend

00:19:08.286 --> 00:19:10.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then leaving before he arrived.

00:19:10.877 --> 00:19:15.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was our question,
so we should wait for the answer.

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:19.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait for it, not in a way
that makes people feel uncomfortable,

00:19:19.444 --> 00:19:21.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by listening kindly.

00:19:21.868 --> 00:19:25.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By listening, we, in effect, say,

00:19:25.253 --> 00:19:28.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are important to me.”

00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:32.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, unlike Jesus, we don’t already know
what’s going on inside of people,

00:19:32.524 --> 00:19:35.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s not until they
answer our question

00:19:35.784 --> 00:19:39.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can tailor our comments
to fit their situation.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:46.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a disciple-maker
uses questions skillfully.

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:04.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The shower is free!

00:20:39.848 --> 00:20:42.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are sisters, we are brothers,

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sons and daughters, and more.”

00:21:23.226 --> 00:21:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo!

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:26.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give me a truth.

00:21:26.945 --> 00:21:28.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, what?

00:21:28.324 --> 00:21:31.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your sign says “Learn Bible Truths,”

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:33.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I assume

00:21:33.255 --> 00:21:35.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re here to share said truths.

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So share one.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name’s Neeta.
What’s yours?

00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:41.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade.

00:21:41.572 --> 00:21:42.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the stone?

00:21:42.951 --> 00:21:46.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like I’m jaded.

00:21:47.882 --> 00:21:50.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to share something,
or what?

00:21:50.807 --> 00:21:53.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, yeah.

00:21:53.733 --> 00:21:56.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know the Bible says
you can live forever?

00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heaven?

00:21:57.786 --> 00:21:59.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that what you’re sharing?

00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:01.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not exactly new, is it?

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says
that you can live forever on earth?

00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:08.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why would I want that?
This place is a mess.

00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:10.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it won’t be in the future.

00:22:10.658 --> 00:22:14.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 21:4 promises:

00:22:14.628 --> 00:22:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will wipe out

00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:20.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every tear from their eyes,
and death will be no more,

00:22:20.938 --> 00:22:24.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“neither will mourning
nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:22:24.532 --> 00:22:27.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:22:27.499 --> 00:22:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since there’s no death
or pain in heaven,

00:22:30.968 --> 00:22:33.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where would this promise apply?

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:36.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth.

00:22:38.908 --> 00:22:41.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know the Bible said that.

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wicked!

00:22:46.346 --> 00:22:47.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that’s cool.

00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, OK.

00:22:48.895 --> 00:22:50.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to learn
how to be part of that future?

00:22:52.197 --> 00:22:54.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah.
Uh, thanks.

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, I’m not really
the churchy type, and I’m— I’m late.

00:22:58.842 --> 00:23:00.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So see you later.

00:23:05.695 --> 00:23:09.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Neeta
prefaced some of her questions?

00:23:09.707 --> 00:23:11.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know?

00:23:11.838 --> 00:23:15.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know the Bible
says you can live forever?

00:23:15.683 --> 00:23:19.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I mean did you know the Bible says
you can live forever on earth?”

00:23:19.904 --> 00:23:24.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a thought-provoking question
to get the conversation started.

00:23:24.751 --> 00:23:28.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe it’s been a little while since you
were able to stand in a public place

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a witnessing cart,
as we saw Neeta doing here,

00:23:31.939 --> 00:23:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can have conversations
on the phone,

00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps in stores,
or in the park.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions also work well in letters.

00:23:40.673 --> 00:23:45.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s easy for us to think
of questions on topics that interest us,

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:48.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what is needed is to think of questions

00:23:48.697 --> 00:23:51.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others will enjoy answering.

00:23:51.622 --> 00:23:54.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such questions as:

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:59.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know that the Bible describes
a time when sickness will be no more?

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:04.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think we’ll ever see
true economic security?

00:24:04.201 --> 00:24:06.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It would be nice to be able to plan.

00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:10.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you think is a reliable source
of information about the future?

00:24:12.099 --> 00:24:16.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think we could be living
in what the Bible calls ‘the last days’?

00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:22.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ve noticed that many people still pray,
especially when they have problems.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think anyone
listens to prayers?

00:24:26.016 --> 00:24:28.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God listen to all prayers?”

00:24:28.816 --> 00:24:32.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Viewpoint questions
—viewpoint questions invite people

00:24:32.953 --> 00:24:34.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express their thoughts.

00:24:34.959 --> 00:24:37.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often Jesus would pause,

00:24:37.717 --> 00:24:42.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask people what they thought,
and then listen to their response.

00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:45.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after the death
of Martha’s brother Lazarus,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told her
as recorded at John 11:25, 26:

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone who is living and exercises faith
in me will never die at all.”

00:24:55.603 --> 00:24:58.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he asked her:

00:24:58.486 --> 00:25:01.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe this?”

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:06.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe this?”

00:25:06.427 --> 00:25:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he listened
as she expressed her faith.

00:25:09.937 --> 00:25:14.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This type of question can be very effective
in our disciple-making work.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or like Jesus,

00:25:16.916 --> 00:25:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can use a series of questions
to help people reason.

00:25:20.343 --> 00:25:24.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video, did you notice
how after reading Revelation 21:4,

00:25:24.354 --> 00:25:28.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta asked Jade,
“Since there’s no death or pain in heaven,

00:25:28.826 --> 00:25:32.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where would this promise apply?”
and then she asks,

00:25:32.963 --> 00:25:37.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to learn
how to be a part of that future?”

00:25:37.309 --> 00:25:41.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We improve our skills
by imitating Jesus.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as our skill improves,
our joy increases.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus delighted to make disciples,
and we can too.

00:25:50.306 --> 00:25:54.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By asking questions
and then listening to people’s answers,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may help some of them
to accept the good news

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will definitely experience firsthand

00:26:00.586 --> 00:26:03.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy of disciple-making.

00:26:03.971 --> 00:26:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Patrick LaFranca,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:26:07.398 --> 00:26:09.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next part of this symposium,

00:26:09.947 --> 00:26:12.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:26:12.079 --> 00:26:17.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills—
Unleashing the Power of God’s Word.”

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As disciple-makers,
we are somewhat like a carpenter

00:26:27.207 --> 00:26:29.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has a toolbox, and inside,

00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:32.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has hand tools and he has power tools.

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:37.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likes the power tools because they
save him a lot of time and energy.

00:26:37.278 --> 00:26:41.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a power drill
that can penetrate hardwood.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a power sander

00:26:43.296 --> 00:26:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can strip away layers of built-up grime.

00:26:47.141 --> 00:26:49.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a power nailer

00:26:49.188 --> 00:26:52.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can nail together pieces very quickly.

00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:56.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise, we have a Teaching Toolbox,

00:26:56.878 --> 00:27:00.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inside, we have many useful tools.

00:27:00.472 --> 00:27:02.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s no question,

00:27:02.478 --> 00:27:06.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most powerful tool we have is God’s Word.

00:27:06.531 --> 00:27:09.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul
described God’s Word

00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:13.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 4:12:

00:27:14.931 --> 00:27:19.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the word of God
is alive and exerts power

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:27.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pierces even
to the dividing of soul and spirit,

00:27:27.217 --> 00:27:29.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of joints from the marrow,

00:27:29.223 --> 00:27:33.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is able to discern
thoughts and intentions of the heart.”

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:38.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul says it’s like a sword
that can pierce right to the heart.

00:27:38.877 --> 00:27:43.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is that important
in our disciple-making work?

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because we cannot read hearts.

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:49.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we use God’s powerful Word,

00:27:49.617 --> 00:27:52.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we begin to discern whether the person

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “rightly disposed for everlasting life”

00:27:55.593 --> 00:27:58.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can perhaps help that person

00:27:58.184 --> 00:28:01.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like using the carpenter’s power tools.

00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:06.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, it can penetrate
right to the heart of a person.

00:28:06.458 --> 00:28:09.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can strip away what’s on the surface

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help the person
realize what he really is.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can really nail down the points.

00:28:16.613 --> 00:28:21.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul
realized God’s Word was dynamic.

00:28:21.461 --> 00:28:23.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it is described that way.

00:28:23.885 --> 00:28:25.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s dynamic because it comes

00:28:25.974 --> 00:28:28.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the living God, Jehovah.

00:28:28.816 --> 00:28:33.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, these words
are not just words on a page.

00:28:33.496 --> 00:28:38.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that these
are words from the mouth of Jehovah.

00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother asked this question,

00:28:41.645 --> 00:28:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you were preaching
from house to house with Jehovah himself,

00:28:46.242 --> 00:28:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you do all the speaking
or would you allow him to talk?”

00:28:50.923 --> 00:28:53.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we open the Bible,

00:28:53.556 --> 00:28:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are allowing Jehovah to speak,
and that is powerful.

00:28:59.657 --> 00:29:03.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul went
to the city of Thessalonica,

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he found Gentiles
worshipping lifeless idols.

00:29:07.848 --> 00:29:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:29:09.895 --> 00:29:13.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 1:9,
Paul wrote that these Gentiles

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had ‘turned away from their lifeless idols

00:29:16.874 --> 00:29:19.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve the true and living God.’

00:29:19.173 --> 00:29:21.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that happen?

00:29:21.346 --> 00:29:23.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 2, verse 13, Paul noted

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:26.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they had ‘received the word of God’

00:29:26.862 --> 00:29:30.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that word
was ‘at work in those believers.’

00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:34.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul rejoiced with those results.

00:29:34.426 --> 00:29:37.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for us too, one of our greatest joys

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to see how a new disciple

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:42.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows God’s Word to work in him,

00:29:42.993 --> 00:29:45.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he makes big changes.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
notice how Neeta

00:29:48.635 --> 00:29:51.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unleashes the power of God’s Word.

00:30:13.082 --> 00:30:15.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

00:30:15.464 --> 00:30:17.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi again.

00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:20.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re really quite stealthy.

00:30:20.228 --> 00:30:22.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brilliant, right?

00:30:22.443 --> 00:30:24.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s perfect when I’m late for class,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is always.

00:30:27.082 --> 00:30:28.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last week you spoke about promises,

00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:35.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m not about church,

00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:38.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I am about promises.

00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:39.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

00:30:39.577 --> 00:30:42.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well, if these are God’s promises,

00:30:42.711 --> 00:30:46.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t it make sense to go to his Word
to find out how to enjoy them?

00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seems right.

00:30:47.183 --> 00:30:48.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:30:48.144 --> 00:30:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is John 17:3.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to read it?

00:30:57.087 --> 00:30:59.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, out loud?

00:30:59.803 --> 00:31:02.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?
Don’t you know what it says?

00:31:03.272 --> 00:31:04.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do, but it’s nice to hear it again.

00:31:08.203 --> 00:31:11.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This means everlasting life,

00:31:11.379 --> 00:31:15.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their coming to know you,
the only true God,

00:31:15.767 --> 00:31:18.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one
whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

00:31:20.155 --> 00:31:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, based on this,
what means everlasting life?

00:31:22.955 --> 00:31:25.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting to know God.

00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:31.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you get to know something
you’re not even sure exists?

00:31:31.397 --> 00:31:34.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to explore that answer
next time you come by?

00:31:35.743 --> 00:31:37.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who said anything about next time?

00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:39.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um.

00:31:39.462 --> 00:31:41.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I’m just winding you up.

00:31:41.092 --> 00:31:42.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you later.

00:31:48.739 --> 00:31:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see how Neeta
unleashed the power of God’s Word?

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:58.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She asked a simple question
that led to reading John 17:3.

00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:02.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is a simple but powerful scripture.

00:32:02.112 --> 00:32:06.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was the most skillful Disciple-Maker.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He based his teaching
completely on God’s Word.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it was possible,
he actually read from the Scriptures.

00:32:14.858 --> 00:32:19.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may remember
the account in Luke chapter 4,

00:32:19.413 --> 00:32:23.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus went back
to his hometown of Nazareth,

00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:28.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he entered the synagogue
and he read from the scroll of Isaiah.

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:31.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the prophecy about the Anointed One

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:36.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would preach good news
in God’s acceptable year.

00:32:36.129 --> 00:32:40.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus didn’t stop
at just reading the scripture;

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:42.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he explained its meaning.

00:32:42.983 --> 00:32:45.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Today this scripture

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you just heard is fulfilled.”

00:32:48.583 --> 00:32:51.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those townspeople
could have understood that

00:32:51.257 --> 00:32:54.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had left the town,

00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:56.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
left his carpentry work months earlier,

00:32:56.857 --> 00:32:59.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had begun his ministry.

00:32:59.281 --> 00:33:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, it’s not enough
for us just to read a scripture;

00:33:04.087 --> 00:33:06.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must explain its meaning.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Neeta did that.

00:33:08.851 --> 00:33:13.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember after John 17:3 was read,
she asked this question,

00:33:13.866 --> 00:33:18.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So based on this,
what means everlasting life?”

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the girl got it.

00:33:20.761 --> 00:33:23.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means getting to know God.

00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:28.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do, though,
if our listener doesn’t get it?

00:33:28.576 --> 00:33:33.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can just reread
the key words in that verse.

00:33:34.844 --> 00:33:38.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, friends,
we must be careful

00:33:38.062 --> 00:33:42.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to assume that people understand
the terms we commonly use.

00:33:42.199 --> 00:33:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we often talk about the Kingdom.

00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:49.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to our listener,
they may be thinking of heaven.

00:33:49.931 --> 00:33:54.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may be thinking it’s a condition
of one’s heart, not a government.

00:33:54.026 --> 00:33:56.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to explain.

00:33:56.868 --> 00:34:01.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, be patient as we use God’s Word.

00:34:01.548 --> 00:34:04.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in God and appreciation

00:34:04.265 --> 00:34:08.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Scriptures take time to grow.

00:34:08.026 --> 00:34:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus illustrated this

00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:13.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mark 4:26.

00:34:13.709 --> 00:34:15.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just read that:

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he went on to say:

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:20.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘In this way the Kingdom of God is just

00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:24.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as when a man casts seeds on the ground.’”

00:34:24.031 --> 00:34:26.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, like a farmer,

00:34:26.372 --> 00:34:30.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we spread the Kingdom message,
we’re casting seeds,

00:34:30.383 --> 00:34:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do we expect those seeds
to sprout overnight?

00:34:34.897 --> 00:34:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explains
the growth process in verse 28:

00:34:39.912 --> 00:34:44.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On its own the ground bears fruit gradually,

00:34:44.801 --> 00:34:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“first the stalk, then the head,

00:34:47.517 --> 00:34:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally the full grain in the head.”

00:34:50.986 --> 00:34:54.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a gradual process.

00:34:54.245 --> 00:34:58.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The farmer waters
and nurtures the seed, but he must wait.

00:34:58.592 --> 00:35:03.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, we need to be
patient disciple-makers.

00:35:03.063 --> 00:35:05.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may take many return visits

00:35:05.905 --> 00:35:09.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we actually start a Bible study.

00:35:09.039 --> 00:35:12.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on each return visit,
let’s try to help the person

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to progressively build faith in God’s Word.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:21.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example
of how we could help a person

00:35:21.493 --> 00:35:26.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to appreciate that the Bible
has practical up-to-date advice.

00:35:26.507 --> 00:35:29.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister does this:

00:35:29.015 --> 00:35:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She asks: “What would you say
is the key to getting along with people?

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:38.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May I read a proverb from the Bible?”

00:35:38.418 --> 00:35:42.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she reads Proverbs 17:14, which says:

00:35:42.847 --> 00:35:46.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Beginning a fight
is like opening a floodgate;

00:35:46.232 --> 00:35:49.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the quarrel
breaks out, take your leave.”

00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:51.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she asks,

00:35:51.164 --> 00:35:54.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think that this advice
could help us to get along with others?”

00:35:54.883 --> 00:35:58.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A reasonable person would say yes.

00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:01.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help a person build faith

00:36:01.068 --> 00:36:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible
is a book of reliable prophecy?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, on one return visit,
we could briefly discuss

00:36:08.214 --> 00:36:12.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophecy at Isaiah 13:20.

00:36:12.017 --> 00:36:15.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This says that the city of Babylon

00:36:15.444 --> 00:36:18.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would ‘never again be inhabited.’

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq, 

00:36:23.175 --> 00:36:25.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the ruins of Babylon.

00:36:25.222 --> 00:36:29.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one lives there,
and no one has for centuries.

00:36:29.778 --> 00:36:32.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help someone build faith

00:36:32.243 --> 00:36:34.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there exists a Creator?

00:36:34.834 --> 00:36:38.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply read Hebrews 3:4:

00:36:38.595 --> 00:36:42.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every house is constructed by someone,

00:36:42.147 --> 00:36:45.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who constructed all things is God.”

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:47.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we could ask:

00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If someone told you
that the house you live in

00:36:50.923 --> 00:36:54.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constructed itself, would you believe them?”

00:36:54.475 --> 00:36:56.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously not.

00:36:56.523 --> 00:37:01.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither could we really believe
that this whole universe constructed itself.

00:37:01.538 --> 00:37:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brothers and sisters,

00:37:04.087 --> 00:37:07.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is a powerful tool.

00:37:07.054 --> 00:37:10.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s unleash its power in our ministry.

00:37:10.272 --> 00:37:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will become
more effective disciple-makers,

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will overflow with joy as we see

00:37:17.794 --> 00:37:22.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Word of God at work in a new believer.

00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:25.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Splane,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:37:25.442 --> 00:37:28.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next part of this symposium,

00:37:28.493 --> 00:37:31.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:37:31.585 --> 00:37:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills—
Illustrating Key Points.”

00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:48.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you find it easy to think up
effective illustrations for the ministry?

00:37:48.176 --> 00:37:50.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sure don’t.

00:37:50.182 --> 00:37:52.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some have a real gift for it.

00:37:52.982 --> 00:37:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a friend like that.

00:37:55.238 --> 00:37:59.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can look at almost any situation
and think of an illustration.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, we were traveling
along a mountain road.

00:38:03.554 --> 00:38:05.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was driving.

00:38:05.519 --> 00:38:07.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My car wasn’t very good.

00:38:07.566 --> 00:38:09.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the best
I could afford at the time.

00:38:09.865 --> 00:38:13.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And suddenly,
a red warning light came on.

00:38:13.542 --> 00:38:18.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quick as a flash, my friend said:
“I just thought of a great illustration.

00:38:18.306 --> 00:38:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conscience
is like a warning light.”

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His first thought is an illustration;

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his second thought,
‘Uh-oh, we’re in trouble.’

00:38:28.754 --> 00:38:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Illustrations come naturally to him;
it’s just like breathing to him.

00:38:33.476 --> 00:38:38.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have the gift,
and the rest of us have to work at it.

00:38:38.533 --> 00:38:40.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why should we work at it?

00:38:40.998 --> 00:38:44.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we learn
to use illustrations?

00:38:44.007 --> 00:38:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, because Jesus used them,
and he was the greatest Teacher of them all.

00:38:48.771 --> 00:38:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus used illustrations a lot,

00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:54.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we find when we read

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:57.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:34.

00:38:57.756 --> 00:38:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:38:59.762 --> 00:39:01.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this together.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:34:

00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:12.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All of these things Jesus
spoke to the crowds by illustrations.

00:39:12.257 --> 00:39:15.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, without an illustration

00:39:15.475 --> 00:39:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not speak to them.”

00:39:18.902 --> 00:39:23.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that an illustration
is often the most effective way

00:39:23.582 --> 00:39:26.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to touch the heart,
and that’s especially true

00:39:26.758 --> 00:39:29.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if people are featured
in the illustration.

00:39:29.976 --> 00:39:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, suppose I say,
‘If you’re going along the road

00:39:32.902 --> 00:39:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and you see someone in trouble,
stop and help him

00:39:36.412 --> 00:39:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if he’s of a different race.’

00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:41.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s clear.
It makes the point.

00:39:41.761 --> 00:39:45.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ illustration
about the neighborly Samaritan

00:39:45.104 --> 00:39:48.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes the same point,
but it’s so much more effective.

00:39:48.489 --> 00:39:50.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stirs the emotions.

00:39:50.495 --> 00:39:52.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It engages the mind.

00:39:52.543 --> 00:39:56.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel pity for the poor Jew
who fell among thieves.

00:39:56.429 --> 00:40:00.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel love for the Samaritan
who stopped to help him

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and disgust for the priest
and Levite who didn’t stop.

00:40:05.247 --> 00:40:08.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re determined
not to be like them.

00:40:08.256 --> 00:40:12.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An illustration can put
a human face on a problem

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reinforce our determination
to apply the lesson.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A good illustration
can help a Bible student

00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:22.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grasp the point
he’s been struggling with.

00:40:22.674 --> 00:40:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how that works
in a conversation Neeta

00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:29.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is having with Jade
in a coffee shop.

00:40:46.118 --> 00:40:47.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do this.

00:40:51.425 --> 00:40:53.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a bit of a neat freak.

00:40:53.431 --> 00:40:55.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t say.

00:40:55.437 --> 00:40:59.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last time we discussed
how God created us to live forever,

00:40:59.449 --> 00:41:01.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which raises the question,
Why do we die?

00:41:01.998 --> 00:41:03.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Totally!

00:41:03.335 --> 00:41:05.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Totally, what?

00:41:05.049 --> 00:41:08.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like, I mean, I totally agree
that’s what we talked about.

00:41:08.475 --> 00:41:10.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, right.

00:41:10.941 --> 00:41:13.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open to Romans 5:12.

00:41:13.825 --> 00:41:18.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait, uh, why don’t I read it
out loud so we can both enjoy it?

00:41:23.394 --> 00:41:26.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why, just as through one man

00:41:26.947 --> 00:41:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sin entered into the world

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:31.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and death through sin,

00:41:31.544 --> 00:41:33.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and so death spread to all to men

00:41:33.967 --> 00:41:36.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:41:36.057 --> 00:41:38.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, hold it.

00:41:38.105 --> 00:41:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Adam the one man?

00:41:39.902 --> 00:41:41.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This doesn’t make sense.

00:41:43.412 --> 00:41:46.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said Adam was perfect
and wouldn’t die.

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:41:48.176 --> 00:41:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he sins and loses that.

00:41:51.227 --> 00:41:53.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s that got to do with me?

00:41:53.191 --> 00:41:55.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I die because he’s stupid?

00:41:55.197 --> 00:41:59.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe it’s not
how I would’ve put it.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:07.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When parents
with a severe genetic defect

00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:09.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have children, what happens?

00:42:09.656 --> 00:42:11.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually the kids inherit it.

00:42:11.704 --> 00:42:13.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Precisely.

00:42:13.752 --> 00:42:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Adam sinned,
that sin became like a genetic defect

00:42:17.513 --> 00:42:20.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that caused sickness, aging, and death;

00:42:20.814 --> 00:42:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and since we’re all his children . . .

00:42:25.996 --> 00:42:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, brilliant!

00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:31.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get it!

00:42:31.512 --> 00:42:35.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we watch a little video
that helps put it all together?

00:42:47.142 --> 00:42:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Neeta’s illustration effective?

00:42:50.986 --> 00:42:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade was struggling to understand
how she could inherit imperfection from Adam,

00:42:55.959 --> 00:43:00.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man who lived long ago,
and she wasn’t going to get past it.

00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:04.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was the point
Neeta chose to illustrate.

00:43:04.359 --> 00:43:09.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you’re studying with someone,
choose carefully what you’ll illustrate.

00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:11.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let it be a main point in the lesson

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:14.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an idea that your student
is having trouble with.

00:43:14.556 --> 00:43:19.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There has to be a good reason
for using an illustration.

00:43:20.992 --> 00:43:23.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our illustrations
should be appealing.

00:43:23.917 --> 00:43:26.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:43:26.383 --> 00:43:31.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An illustration will appeal to the student
if it’s about something familiar.

00:43:31.314 --> 00:43:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now again, Jesus’ parable
of the Samaritan comes to mind.

00:43:35.618 --> 00:43:38.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The setting
of the illustration was nearby

00:43:38.585 --> 00:43:42.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a familiar road
between Jerusalem and Jericho,

00:43:42.346 --> 00:43:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the hanging gardens of Babylon
or the pyramids of Egypt.

00:43:46.275 --> 00:43:48.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was realistic.

00:43:48.322 --> 00:43:51.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many robberies along that road,

00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:53.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the attitude of the priests and Levite

00:43:53.588 --> 00:43:58.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward that poor,
injured Jew was totally believable.

00:43:58.227 --> 00:44:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta also chose wisely.

00:44:01.444 --> 00:44:05.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her illustration
was about inheriting a birth defect

00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something she knew
Jade would understand.

00:44:09.385 --> 00:44:13.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you may have
a couple of go-to illustrations

00:44:13.146 --> 00:44:17.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve used for years
and years—and years.

00:44:17.743 --> 00:44:21.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not look for fresh ones
that make the same points?

00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:24.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put a little sparkle
back in your ministry.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider
two ways of doing that.

00:44:28.232 --> 00:44:31.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, be observant.

00:44:31.157 --> 00:44:34.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 6:26, Jesus said:

00:44:34.208 --> 00:44:38.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Observe intently
the birds of heaven.”

00:44:38.303 --> 00:44:43.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was aware of his surroundings,
and he thought about what he saw.

00:44:43.193 --> 00:44:47.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed the housewife,
children playing in the village square,

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the farmer,
the rich man with his treasures.

00:44:51.216 --> 00:44:53.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So learn from Jesus.

00:44:53.222 --> 00:44:56.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Slow down, and smell the flowers.

00:44:56.106 --> 00:44:59.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then think
of an illustration about flowers.

00:45:01.288 --> 00:45:04.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you feel you
don’t have a creative bone in your body,

00:45:04.673 --> 00:45:07.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet you still need fresh illustrations?

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second resource
is our publications.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to the <i>Watch Tower Publications Index</i>
under “Illustrations,”

00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:17.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll find an abundance

00:45:17.377 --> 00:45:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of beautiful illustrations
that have been used in our publications.

00:45:21.096 --> 00:45:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you are studying
our later publications,

00:45:23.771 --> 00:45:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take note
of the illustrations that are used.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Choose simple illustrations.

00:45:31.001 --> 00:45:34.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use little things to explain big things

00:45:34.553 --> 00:45:38.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and simple things
to explain complicated things.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:42.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister at a congregation meeting
used a very simple

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:47.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but effective illustration
regarding Jehovah and the ransom.

00:45:47.215 --> 00:45:49.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “When you’re shopping,

00:45:49.764 --> 00:45:53.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you never pay full price
for damaged goods.”

00:45:53.985 --> 00:45:56.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her point?

00:45:56.033 --> 00:45:58.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all damaged goods,
yet Jehovah

00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:02.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paid full price for us
with the life of his Son.

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The illustration was simple.

00:46:04.642 --> 00:46:09.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was appealing because it was
about something familiar—shopping.

00:46:09.656 --> 00:46:12.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was also appropriate
to the audience.

00:46:12.498 --> 00:46:14.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were a lot
of Bethelites in the audience,

00:46:14.755 --> 00:46:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you know that Bethelites
never pay full price for anything.

00:46:18.808 --> 00:46:21.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re illustrating a point,

00:46:21.232 --> 00:46:24.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoid distracting the student
with minor details.

00:46:24.492 --> 00:46:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Minor details—if they don’t fit,
they can get you into a lot of trouble.

00:46:29.005 --> 00:46:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they don’t work
with the main point of the illustration,

00:46:31.847 --> 00:46:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the student may focus
on the inconsistencies

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and miss the point altogether.

00:46:37.447 --> 00:46:41.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in summary, what do we say?

00:46:41.083 --> 00:46:46.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes time to develop good illustrations,
but it’s worth the effort.

00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:50.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have the gift,
use it and share it with others.

00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:53.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if, like me,
you don’t have the gift, work at it.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be glad you did

00:46:55.876 --> 00:46:58.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will your Bible students.

00:47:00.181 --> 00:47:03.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:47:03.983 --> 00:47:06.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present
the next part of the symposium,

00:47:06.658 --> 00:47:09.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:47:09.583 --> 00:47:14.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills—
Teaching With Enthusiasm.”

00:47:22.622 --> 00:47:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try, if you will, to imagine a virus

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:29.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that becomes a global pandemic.

00:47:29.684 --> 00:47:32.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The daily news is ominous.

00:47:32.484 --> 00:47:35.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear and panic hold full sway.

00:47:35.911 --> 00:47:39.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not
too difficult to imagine, is it?

00:47:39.212 --> 00:47:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if they found a cure?

00:47:43.517 --> 00:47:46.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now instantly
the newscaster’s tone would change;

00:47:46.693 --> 00:47:48.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would be enthusiastic.

00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:50.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why is that?

00:47:50.788 --> 00:47:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he has good news
to share to the world’s population.

00:47:55.218 --> 00:47:57.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how about us?

00:47:57.266 --> 00:48:01.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Isaiah 52:7

00:48:01.737 --> 00:48:03.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 52:7.

00:48:03.827 --> 00:48:08.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we be enthusiastic
when we teach those

00:48:08.298 --> 00:48:13.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been exposed
to the evil viruses of Satan’s old world?

00:48:13.313 --> 00:48:16.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because we have the best news ever

00:48:16.531 --> 00:48:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share with the world’s population.

00:48:18.788 --> 00:48:23.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how this
is brought out at Isaiah 52:7.

00:48:23.343 --> 00:48:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “How beautiful on the mountains

00:48:25.934 --> 00:48:30.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are the feet of the one bringing good news,

00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:32.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one proclaiming peace,

00:48:32.746 --> 00:48:36.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one bringing good news
of something better,

00:48:36.507 --> 00:48:39.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one proclaiming salvation,

00:48:39.181 --> 00:48:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one saying to Zion:
‘Your God has become King!’”

00:48:43.653 --> 00:48:46.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have good news that’s better

00:48:46.912 --> 00:48:50.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than conquering one perturbing virus.

00:48:50.882 --> 00:48:53.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the videos of this symposium,

00:48:53.473 --> 00:48:58.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you probably noticed
that initially Neeta was enthused

00:48:58.446 --> 00:49:02.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a regular Bible study
had been established with Jade.

00:49:02.751 --> 00:49:05.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s our continued enthusiasm

00:49:05.885 --> 00:49:09.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help keep a student interested

00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:12.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivate them to act.

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:49:14.953 --> 00:49:18.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will note that Neeta
learns the importance

00:49:18.715 --> 00:49:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of maintaining enthusiasm.

00:49:42.284 --> 00:49:43.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta, your phone buzzed.

00:49:48.511 --> 00:49:50.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jade again.

00:49:50.851 --> 00:49:53.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve only studied once this month.

00:49:54.779 --> 00:49:56.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so unscheduled.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:58.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought you said she was doing well?

00:49:58.332 --> 00:49:59.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was.

00:49:59.669 --> 00:50:02.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s just, “See you later.”

00:50:03.848 --> 00:50:05.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was your last study?

00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:09.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very interesting question,

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s not really what we are talking
about in this paragraph, is it?

00:50:13.752 --> 00:50:17.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just read the scripture, shall we?

00:50:24.367 --> 00:50:29.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:50:30.385 --> 00:50:32.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never even attempts
to explain why she cancels.

00:50:33.393 --> 00:50:35.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand.

00:50:35.023 --> 00:50:36.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, I do.

00:50:37.405 --> 00:50:40.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if she’s still open to studying,

00:50:40.456 --> 00:50:44.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can’t let these little things
drain your enthusiasm.

00:50:44.969 --> 00:50:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:50:46.348 --> 00:50:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just— I wish she was more structured.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like she doesn’t take
anything seriously.

00:50:54.247 --> 00:50:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No study is perfect.

00:50:55.417 --> 00:50:58.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s making some effort; focus on that.

00:51:00.055 --> 00:51:02.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone’s enthusiasm
is contagious, it’s yours.

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I haven’t mentioned it already,

00:51:18.318 --> 00:51:20.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love our chats,

00:51:20.867 --> 00:51:22.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I appreciate all your questions.

00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:51:24.503 --> 00:51:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know sometimes they’re crazy.

00:51:26.843 --> 00:51:29.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you’re a deep thinker.

00:51:29.476 --> 00:51:32.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good for both of us.

00:51:36.914 --> 00:51:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, um, yeah.

00:51:39.422 --> 00:51:40.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, cool.

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:54.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when Neeta first met Jade?

00:51:54.592 --> 00:51:58.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade said, “Like I’m jaded.”

00:51:58.854 --> 00:52:01.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English word “jaded”

00:52:01.278 --> 00:52:05.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “made dull, apathetic, or cynical.”

00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:10.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we just noticed
that Neeta was annoyed with Jade.

00:52:10.054 --> 00:52:13.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She became dull, apathetic, unenthusiastic

00:52:13.815 --> 00:52:16.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of Jade’s attitude.

00:52:16.239 --> 00:52:19.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that affected Neeta’s enthusiasm,

00:52:19.833 --> 00:52:21.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it had a circular effect,

00:52:21.964 --> 00:52:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely contributing
to Jade’s seeming lack of interest.

00:52:26.268 --> 00:52:30.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we develop enthusiasm?

00:52:31.743 --> 00:52:36.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You likely noticed that Neeta and Jade

00:52:36.591 --> 00:52:39.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak the same language (well,  almost),

00:52:39.725 --> 00:52:42.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re
two totally different personalities.

00:52:42.107 --> 00:52:46.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be teaching someone
of a totally different cultural background,

00:52:46.787 --> 00:52:51.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the good news is
that enthusiasm crosses all boundaries.

00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me Romans 12:11

00:52:55.898 --> 00:52:58.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans chapter 12.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s good to remember
that enthusiasm is not just some giddy,

00:53:02.835 --> 00:53:05.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outward show of excitement;

00:53:05.008 --> 00:53:07.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it actually happens from within us.

00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:11:

00:53:10.273 --> 00:53:13.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be industrious, not lazy.

00:53:13.282 --> 00:53:15.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be aglow with the spirit.

00:53:15.748 --> 00:53:18.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Slave for Jehovah.”

00:53:18.213 --> 00:53:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to highlight that matter
of being “aglow with the spirit.”

00:53:23.145 --> 00:53:28.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The word translated “aglow”
literally means “boiling.”

00:53:28.118 --> 00:53:31.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to maintain enthusiasm,

00:53:31.335 --> 00:53:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need a constant flow of God’s holy spirit.

00:53:34.637 --> 00:53:39.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s like the heat source
that keeps us boiling.

00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:42.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we prepare
to teach a Bible student?

00:53:42.034 --> 00:53:43.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we might think,

00:53:43.747 --> 00:53:48.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I like to go over
the lesson in advance,

00:53:48.302 --> 00:53:52.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I remind myself
of what the cited scriptures say.’

00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:54.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s good.
That’s necessary.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that all is just happening in our head.

00:53:57.705 --> 00:54:01.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we get the water boiling inside?

00:54:01.383 --> 00:54:06.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember
the suggestion at Ezra 7:10?

00:54:06.188 --> 00:54:11.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra there said
that he ‘prepared his heart to teach.’

00:54:11.203 --> 00:54:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with that thought in mind,
please find Psalm 45:1.

00:54:15.758 --> 00:54:18.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to click the download button.

00:54:18.767 --> 00:54:21.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to download
from our head to our heart.

00:54:21.818 --> 00:54:23.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the heart is involved here.

00:54:23.824 --> 00:54:28.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 45:1 says:
“My heart

00:54:28.212 --> 00:54:33.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[it does not say my head;
my heart] is stirred by something good.

00:54:33.227 --> 00:54:36.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I say: ‘My song is about a king.’

00:54:36.695 --> 00:54:41.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May my tongue be
the stylus of a skilled copyist.”

00:54:41.501 --> 00:54:44.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “My heart is stirred.”

00:54:44.886 --> 00:54:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, interestingly,
the word translated “stirred”

00:54:47.937 --> 00:54:51.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also means “to boil or bubble up.”

00:54:51.531 --> 00:54:56.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s the result if we get
that action going inside of us?

00:54:56.086 --> 00:54:58.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The end of the verse said that ‘my tongue

00:54:58.718 --> 00:55:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[in other words, my speech] will be skilled.’

00:55:02.605 --> 00:55:05.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we improve
our skills as a disciple-maker

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:09.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we maintain enthusiasm.

00:55:09.041 --> 00:55:13.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we get our enthusiasm bubbling, boiling,

00:55:13.094 --> 00:55:17.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stirred up when we meditate on the importance

00:55:17.231 --> 00:55:20.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the lesson we’re about to teach.

00:55:20.324 --> 00:55:24.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife likes to watch
cooking shows on television,

00:55:24.169 --> 00:55:28.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve noticed that invariably
there’s always an electric blender.

00:55:28.766 --> 00:55:31.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I do realize
that in some of your cultures,

00:55:31.565 --> 00:55:34.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might prefer mortar and pestle

00:55:34.867 --> 00:55:37.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a sharp knife
to cut things up and mix them together.

00:55:37.918 --> 00:55:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have all those ingredients
laid out on the counter before us

00:55:41.135 --> 00:55:45.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe vegetables, herbs,
spices, always salt and pepper.

00:55:45.565 --> 00:55:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that like?

00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:51.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s like having
the ingredients in our mind.

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:54.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve gone over the lesson in advance.
We have the Scriptures.

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:58.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what they say,
but we really don’t get enthused

00:55:58.436 --> 00:56:02.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about that tasty dish until what happens?

00:56:02.072 --> 00:56:05.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We mix all those ingredients in the blender.

00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:08.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We bring it up to a temperature,
maybe even to a boil.

00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:12.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after the dish
is done and we taste it,

00:56:12.353 --> 00:56:14.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mm, mm, mm.

00:56:14.442 --> 00:56:17.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tastes so good.
We get enthusiastic.

00:56:17.075 --> 00:56:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tell others about this great recipe.

00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they’re interested,

00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:25.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want to taste
this culinary sensation as well.

00:56:25.057 --> 00:56:28.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we become enthusiastic?

00:56:28.107 --> 00:56:32.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate—meditation is the blender.

00:56:32.036 --> 00:56:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We take all the ingredients in our mind;

00:56:34.501 --> 00:56:36.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we mix them together into a message

00:56:36.716 --> 00:56:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re now enthused to share with others.

00:56:40.394 --> 00:56:43.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And meditation includes
asking ourselves questions

00:56:43.779 --> 00:56:45.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare the heart.

00:56:45.785 --> 00:56:48.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
before your study, you might ask,

00:56:48.292 --> 00:56:52.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How has this information
benefited me personally?’

00:56:52.596 --> 00:56:55.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Neeta needed to ask herself,

00:56:55.396 --> 00:56:58.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why does Jade need to hear this?’

00:56:58.196 --> 00:57:01.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s the perfect point
at the right time for our student,

00:57:01.748 --> 00:57:05.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we should ask,
‘How will what I’m going to study

00:57:05.259 --> 00:57:07.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefit my student?’

Meditation stirs the heart.

00:57:11.402 --> 00:57:14.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me
1 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:57:17.879 --> 00:57:20.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enthusiasm, or zeal, should not be confused

00:57:20.679 --> 00:57:23.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with being overly emotional.

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:26.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be like throwing
too much hot pepper

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:29.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the blender—overemotional.

00:57:29.288 --> 00:57:33.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our heartfelt conviction
should not cross the line

00:57:33.007 --> 00:57:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become dogmatic
as to what our student must believe.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:42.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you get the sense
of this recipe at 1 Thessalonians 1:5.

00:57:44.583 --> 00:57:47.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Because the good news we preach

00:57:47.007 --> 00:57:49.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not come to you with speech alone.”

00:57:49.682 --> 00:57:53.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words it’s not just words
out of the head, but notice the ingredients.

00:57:53.317 --> 00:57:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Also with power
and with holy spirit

00:57:57.246 --> 00:58:00.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with strong conviction.”

00:58:00.213 --> 00:58:04.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’ve meditated on the material
and we deliver it from the heart,

00:58:04.266 --> 00:58:08.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s reflected in our gestures
and our facial expressions.

00:58:08.195 --> 00:58:11.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We come across as natural and sincere,

00:58:11.747 --> 00:58:15.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, you see, animated
with proper enthusiasm.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re enthusiastic about Bible truths,

00:58:18.809 --> 00:58:23.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is contagious, but in a very good way.

00:58:23.197 --> 00:58:28.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Bible student
will not become jaded, dull, apathetic.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:31.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, your student will be enthusiastic

00:58:31.722 --> 00:58:34.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like you—his teacher.

00:58:34.982 --> 00:58:39.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, we have the privilege
of having Brother Seth Hyatt

00:58:39.077 --> 00:58:41.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(he’s a helper to the Service Committee)

00:58:41.167 --> 00:58:44.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to present the next part of our symposium,

00:58:44.343 --> 00:58:46.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:58:46.767 --> 00:58:50.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills—
Showing Empathy.”

00:58:57.758 --> 00:59:01.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy is a quality that is essential

00:59:01.477 --> 00:59:04.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for effective disciple-making.

00:59:04.486 --> 00:59:07.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, the word “empathy”

00:59:07.536 --> 00:59:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t occur in the main text
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:14.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the idea is clearly conveyed

00:59:14.306 --> 00:59:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in expressions like “fellow feeling.”

00:59:18.151 --> 00:59:22.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus Christ
are beautiful examples

00:59:22.372 --> 00:59:27.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones who display empathy
in their dealings with others.

00:59:27.011 --> 00:59:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Jehovah said to his people:

00:59:30.939 --> 00:59:35.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever touches you
touches the pupil of my eye.”

00:59:35.954 --> 00:59:38.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy.

00:59:38.336 --> 00:59:41.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jesus was approached by a leper

00:59:41.512 --> 00:59:43.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begging to be healed,

00:59:43.936 --> 00:59:46.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was Jesus’ response?

00:59:47.237 --> 00:59:50.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account tells us
that he reached out his hand,

00:59:50.288 --> 00:59:54.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touched the man, and said: “I want to!”

00:59:54.509 --> 00:59:56.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy.

00:59:57.601 --> 01:00:02.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy is the ability to understand
another person’s thinking,

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:06.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feelings, concerns, anxieties.

01:00:08.174 --> 01:00:11.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not come naturally,

01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:14.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it can be cultivated.

01:00:14.442 --> 01:00:17.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures provide us with examples

01:00:17.577 --> 01:00:20.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of individuals who were empathetic.

01:00:20.586 --> 01:00:22.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the apostle Paul,

01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:25.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was a very effective disciple-maker,

01:00:25.642 --> 01:00:28.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also empathetic.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:32.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn in your Bible, please,
to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:35.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verses 7 and 8:

01:00:41.982 --> 01:00:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:49.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as when a nursing mother

01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:52.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“tenderly cares for her own children.

01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:56.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

01:00:56.316 --> 01:00:59.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:02.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only the good news of God

01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:04.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also our very selves,

01:01:04.925 --> 01:01:09.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:14.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Paul approach his ministry?

01:01:14.787 --> 01:01:18.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he says he was “gentle,”

01:01:18.256 --> 01:01:21.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he displayed “tender affection,”

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:25.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those who responded to the good news

01:01:25.527 --> 01:01:28.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became “beloved to [him].”

01:01:29.915 --> 01:01:33.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul uses a very powerful illustration

01:01:33.718 --> 01:01:37.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that of a mother caring for her children.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:39.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the human context,

01:01:39.736 --> 01:01:43.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is probably no more
powerful example of empathy

01:01:43.204 --> 01:01:45.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than that of a mother.

01:01:45.419 --> 01:01:48.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She feels her child’s pain.

01:01:49.348 --> 01:01:53.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her child rejoices, she rejoices.

01:01:53.401 --> 01:01:57.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her child weeps, she weeps.

01:01:57.204 --> 01:01:59.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy.

01:02:00.338 --> 01:02:02.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice,

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:07.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said that he was ‘determined to impart
not only the good news of God

01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:10.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his own soul’?

01:02:11.663 --> 01:02:15.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true
that as we help individuals today,

01:02:15.634 --> 01:02:19.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not a matter of only imparting
the facts of the truth?

01:02:21.651 --> 01:02:25.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible students need help in many ways.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:29.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the apostle Paul,
we’re self-sacrificing,

01:02:29.508 --> 01:02:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
willing to put the interests of others
ahead of our own interests.

01:02:35.902 --> 01:02:37.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re empathetic.

01:02:39.078 --> 01:02:41.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:02:41.585 --> 01:02:43.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take note of how Neeta

01:02:43.591 --> 01:02:47.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides practical assistance
to her Bible student.

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry I’m late.

01:02:58.761 --> 01:02:59.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s fine.

01:03:01.268 --> 01:03:02.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this mine?

01:03:02.856 --> 01:03:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My treat.

01:03:04.653 --> 01:03:06.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, brilliant! Thanks.

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:08.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have any breakfast.

01:03:10.629 --> 01:03:12.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we left off at paragraph 10.

01:03:12.677 --> 01:03:16.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen, I don’t have it in me today.

01:03:16.396 --> 01:03:18.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got like two hours of sleep.

01:03:21.077 --> 01:03:23.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you all right?

01:03:23.292 --> 01:03:26.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just super stressed—can’t focus.

01:03:28.348 --> 01:03:30.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really sorry.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:34.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My boyfriend, school,

01:03:34.408 --> 01:03:37.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work, everything else

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I just don’t even have time to breathe.

01:03:40.802 --> 01:03:43.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my schedule gets a bit crazy,

01:03:43.184 --> 01:03:46.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I focus on organizing what I can.

01:03:46.945 --> 01:03:48.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s that?

01:03:50.204 --> 01:03:52.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I give everything a proper place.

01:03:52.503 --> 01:03:55.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’m not really
the organization type.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:57.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can help,

01:03:57.518 --> 01:04:01.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, if you want.

01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:03.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess a little help couldn’t hurt.

01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:07.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how organized
is your place right now?

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:13.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well,

01:04:13.314 --> 01:04:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with God all things are possible.”

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:20.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where shall we start?

01:04:20.502 --> 01:04:22.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re the neat freak.
You tell me.

01:04:22.466 --> 01:04:26.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find the bed;
we’ll work from there.

01:04:40.687 --> 01:04:42.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

01:04:42.108 --> 01:04:44.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Neeta display empathy?

01:04:46.161 --> 01:04:50.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, she was observant,
she was a good listener,

01:04:50.382 --> 01:04:54.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she offered practical assistance,
didn’t she?

01:04:54.018 --> 01:04:58.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had some food for her Bible student.

01:04:58.448 --> 01:05:01.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the dramatization,

01:05:01.122 --> 01:05:04.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was helping in other practical ways.

01:05:04.131 --> 01:05:08.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think we would all agree
that she showed fellow feeling

01:05:08.352 --> 01:05:10.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her Bible student.

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and I have to do these things as well.

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:15.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be observant.

01:05:15.456 --> 01:05:19.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you know about your Bible student?

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the student’s circumstances in life?

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:26.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the student’s family situation?

01:05:26.154 --> 01:05:30.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the student have hobbies, interests?

01:05:30.584 --> 01:05:34.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the religious background?

01:05:34.095 --> 01:05:36.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does your student believe?

01:05:36.685 --> 01:05:41.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, be observant, and ask good questions.

01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:43.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you ask a question,

01:05:43.915 --> 01:05:47.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give your student time to answer.

01:05:47.342 --> 01:05:49.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is our inclination

01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:52.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we ask our student a question

01:05:52.273 --> 01:05:54.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the answer doesn’t come quickly?

01:05:55.951 --> 01:06:00.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tend to jump in to save our student,

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that approach isn’t really helpful.

01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:07.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you ask a question, be patient

01:06:07.067 --> 01:06:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—allow the student
time to think and to respond.

01:06:11.915 --> 01:06:15.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the student responds, be positive

01:06:15.258 --> 01:06:19.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—commend the student
for being honest, forthright,

01:06:19.479 --> 01:06:24.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if the answer
is not exactly what you were hoping for.

01:06:24.493 --> 01:06:28.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep in mind
that as we observe and listen

01:06:28.965 --> 01:06:32.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask questions
and display personal interest,

01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:35.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re very careful not to pry into matters

01:06:35.944 --> 01:06:38.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are really not our business.

01:06:38.075 --> 01:06:41.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we don’t want to show
inappropriate interest

01:06:41.794 --> 01:06:45.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by becoming overly familiar
with the Bible student.

01:06:47.979 --> 01:06:52.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does your Bible student
need practical assistance?

01:06:52.994 --> 01:06:56.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we listen and observe,

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:59.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re in a position to share information

01:06:59.555 --> 01:07:03.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be truly helpful to the student.

01:07:03.107 --> 01:07:06.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid the tendency
—the temptation—

01:07:06.743 --> 01:07:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give superficial advice.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:14.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s much better to meditate, do research,

01:07:14.307 --> 01:07:17.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you can give the student

01:07:17.107 --> 01:07:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tailored Bible-based advice

01:07:19.823 --> 01:07:22.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taken from Bible-based publications

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:26.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that specifically address
the student’s needs.

01:07:26.092 --> 01:07:28.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is beautiful.

01:07:29.268 --> 01:07:33.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be prepared, too,
to explain how to apply the counsel.

01:07:33.823 --> 01:07:36.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People’s lives are so complicated;

01:07:36.957 --> 01:07:41.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face so many challenges
that they may not know how.

01:07:41.178 --> 01:07:45.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So explain, but don’t pressure.

01:07:47.154 --> 01:07:52.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best change
always comes from the inside out.

01:07:52.043 --> 01:07:55.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, the Bible student’s heart

01:07:55.428 --> 01:07:57.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should motivate him or her

01:07:57.811 --> 01:08:00.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make necessary adjustments in life.

01:08:02.784 --> 01:08:04.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does your student need

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
transportation to the Kingdom Hall?

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:11.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, assist him.

01:08:11.016 --> 01:08:14.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that you can provide
transportation yourself,

01:08:14.234 --> 01:08:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it may be a matter of helping the student
to know where the Kingdom Hall is

01:08:18.664 --> 01:08:21.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then helping him to understand

01:08:21.255 --> 01:08:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the public transportation system.

01:08:25.141 --> 01:08:30.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever help is needed,
take those steps.

01:08:30.156 --> 01:08:34.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ensure that your student
has wholesome association.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time goes by,

01:08:36.508 --> 01:08:40.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your student is sure
to lose former associates,

01:08:40.186 --> 01:08:42.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either because the student decides

01:08:42.777 --> 01:08:45.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the former associates decide.

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:48.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fill the void,

01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:50.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and include your student

01:08:50.842 --> 01:08:54.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in gatherings in keeping
with his spiritual advancement

01:08:54.185 --> 01:08:56.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as appropriate.

01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, show fellow feeling.

01:09:01.624 --> 01:09:05.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, empathy is not a technique;

01:09:05.051 --> 01:09:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a quality that springs from the heart.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:12.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s communicated in so many ways,

01:09:12.406 --> 01:09:14.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just by our words and our actions

01:09:14.955 --> 01:09:19.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by our facial expressions,
our gestures, our body language

01:09:19.134 --> 01:09:22.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all communicate a message to the student.

01:09:22.143 --> 01:09:25.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the student will discern very quickly

01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:29.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if our words and actions
are motivated by love.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are,
then we are demonstrating empathy

01:09:34.555 --> 01:09:39.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflecting the love and concern
that Jehovah has for the Bible student.

01:09:39.528 --> 01:09:44.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what will draw
the student to Jehovah.

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:49.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege we have to share
in this vital disciple-making work!

01:09:49.223 --> 01:09:51.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:55.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may each of us succeed
in showing the quality of empathy.

01:09:56.996 --> 01:10:00.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gary Breaux,
a helper to the Service Committee,

01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:04.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the final part of the symposium,

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

01:10:07.819 --> 01:10:12.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Improve Your Skills—
Reaching the Heart.”

01:10:19.897 --> 01:10:22.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For anyone to become
a servant of Jehovah,

01:10:22.947 --> 01:10:27.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they must have God’s Word
deeply implanted in their heart.

01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:31.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is it so necessary
for us to understand that,

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:36.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what skills will help us
to reach the heart of our students?

01:10:36.905 --> 01:10:41.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave an indication
in his illustration of the sower.

01:10:41.795 --> 01:10:44.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found in Matthew chapter 13,

01:10:44.929 --> 01:10:47.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 19.

01:10:47.645 --> 01:10:52.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:19, it says:

01:10:52.577 --> 01:10:55.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where anyone hears the word
of the Kingdom

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:59.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but does not get the sense of it,
the wicked one comes

01:10:59.263 --> 01:11:03.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and snatches away
what has been sown in his heart.”

01:11:03.651 --> 01:11:08.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So “the word of the Kingdom”
is likened to seeds,

01:11:08.122 --> 01:11:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the soil,
to the figurative heart.

01:11:11.884 --> 01:11:15.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the figurative heart
represents what a person is inside.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:20.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involves his feelings, his affections,
his desires, his motives,

01:11:20.785 --> 01:11:22.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also what he thinks about

01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:26.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how those thoughts
affect decisions in his life.

01:11:26.677 --> 01:11:31.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look back at verse 19,
Jesus said that the seed, in this case,

01:11:31.608 --> 01:11:34.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t grow because the individual

01:11:34.408 --> 01:11:37.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t “get the sense” of the good news.

01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus has given
all of us this assignment

01:11:40.384 --> 01:11:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples of people
of all the nations, baptizing them.”

01:11:45.357 --> 01:11:48.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our teaching needs to help our students

01:11:48.742 --> 01:11:51.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“get the sense” of the good news,

01:11:51.292 --> 01:11:54.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s going to move them to action.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 3:1

01:11:57.476 --> 01:12:02.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlights the importance
of this type of teaching to us.

01:12:02.408 --> 01:12:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Proverbs 3:1.

01:12:06.712 --> 01:12:11.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “My son,
do not forget my teaching,

01:12:11.016 --> 01:12:14.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may your heart observe
my commandments.”

01:12:14.527 --> 01:12:16.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So obedience to God

01:12:16.992 --> 01:12:20.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must come from the heart,
as it indicates.

01:12:20.377 --> 01:12:24.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brothers and sisters,
it’s our responsibility

01:12:24.055 --> 01:12:27.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn how to reach
the heart of our students

01:12:27.774 --> 01:12:31.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that their thinking, their feelings,

01:12:31.034 --> 01:12:36.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their reasonings will move them
to be obedient to Jehovah God.

01:12:36.007 --> 01:12:39.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

01:12:39.517 --> 01:12:44.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how Neeta strives
to reach the heart of her Bible student.

01:12:46.078 --> 01:12:49.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think any more
about what we talked about on Monday?

01:12:49.547 --> 01:12:51.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did.

01:12:52.598 --> 01:12:56.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why would Jehovah
make a rule like that

01:12:56.024 --> 01:12:57.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no sex unless you’re married?

01:12:57.738 --> 01:12:59.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s totally archaic.

01:12:59.702 --> 01:13:01.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might seem odd,

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:05.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what quality do you
most appreciate about Jehovah?

01:13:06.555 --> 01:13:07.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His love.

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:09.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

01:13:09.439 --> 01:13:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if he truly loves us,

01:13:12.448 --> 01:13:15.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48:17:

01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:22.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

01:13:23.898 --> 01:13:25.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[<i>your</i> God, Jade]

01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:29.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One teaching you

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to benefit yourself,

01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:33.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.”

01:13:36.017 --> 01:13:39.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I don’t get it.

01:13:39.904 --> 01:13:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just— It just doesn’t make sense.

01:13:43.205 --> 01:13:47.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Question: Does a little child

01:13:47.677 --> 01:13:52.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always understand why Mum and Dad
warn them not to do certain things?

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:54.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably not.

01:13:55.659 --> 01:13:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why all the rules and warnings?

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:01.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they love them, don’t they?

01:14:03.223 --> 01:14:06.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if Jehovah loves you . . . ?

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:16.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It often takes time to appreciate
why Jehovah asks certain things of us.

01:14:18.016 --> 01:14:19.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we really love him,

01:14:20.858 --> 01:14:24.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have faith that what he asks

01:14:24.536 --> 01:14:27.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is for the best.

01:14:30.846 --> 01:14:35.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The real question is, Do you trust him?

01:14:37.365 --> 01:14:39.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to;

01:14:42.213 --> 01:14:44.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really do.

01:14:51.156 --> 01:14:55.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a good example
of how a Bible study conductor

01:14:55.628 --> 01:14:58.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reaches the heart of a student.

01:14:58.302 --> 01:15:01.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta was calmly helping Jade

01:15:01.353 --> 01:15:04.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to link what she was learning in her study

01:15:04.863 --> 01:15:07.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to her relationship with Jehovah God.

01:15:07.412 --> 01:15:11.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not an intellectual exercise,
so to speak,

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:15.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping her to gain more knowledge
about a certain subject.

01:15:15.227 --> 01:15:19.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s really helping the student
to connect the dots, so to speak,

01:15:19.657 --> 01:15:22.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how the material applies to decisions

01:15:22.916 --> 01:15:25.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are making in their life.

01:15:25.591 --> 01:15:28.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the Bible study,
we want

01:15:28.182 --> 01:15:32.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to constantly direct attention
to Jehovah God.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re talking too much as the teacher,

01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:37.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to be hard to accomplish that.

01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:40.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your effective use of questions

01:15:40.761 --> 01:15:45.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help them connect
the Bible knowledge that they are receiving

01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:50.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the qualities of Jehovah God
—that’s going to make them love him—

01:15:50.164 --> 01:15:52.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities such as his love,

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his goodness, and his righteousness.

01:15:56.390 --> 01:16:00.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example of a question
that might be used:

01:16:00.987 --> 01:16:06.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think Jehovah
would forbid . . . (a certain action)?

01:16:07.465 --> 01:16:10.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that kind of question
is helping your student

01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:12.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begin to understand

01:16:12.145 --> 01:16:15.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the thinking of Jehovah God on matters.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:20.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice it was
not a yes-or-no question?

01:16:20.294 --> 01:16:23.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question actually started with “why.”

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now that forces the student

01:16:26.563 --> 01:16:30.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go to another level
of their thought process

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to explain the reason Jehovah
forbids certain actions,

01:16:34.294 --> 01:16:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s a very good method

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of reaching the heart of a student.

01:16:39.727 --> 01:16:42.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example of another question:

01:16:42.903 --> 01:16:47.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does this show you
that Jehovah is a loving Father?

01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:51.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There again, it’s not a yes-or-no question.

01:16:51.386 --> 01:16:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time it started with “how,”

01:16:54.604 --> 01:16:59.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that now requires
the student to identify the evidence

01:16:59.326 --> 01:17:03.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that proves
that Jehovah is a loving Father.

01:17:03.589 --> 01:17:05.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in the video

01:17:05.929 --> 01:17:09.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Neeta’s questions
were touching Jade’s heart?

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:13.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was skilled at her choice of questions

01:17:13.451 --> 01:17:18.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in the tone of voice she used
when she was asking those questions.

01:17:18.006 --> 01:17:21.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was not hurried
or impatient to get an answer.

01:17:21.976 --> 01:17:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She quietly waited for Jade
to meditate on the question.

01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:31.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her method of teaching
demonstrated a Bible principle

01:17:31.128 --> 01:17:35.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be helpful for us to review,
and it’s found in Proverbs

01:17:35.809 --> 01:17:40.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 20, and verse 5.

01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:46.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 20:5,

01:17:46.298 --> 01:17:51.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “The thoughts of a man’s heart
are like deep waters,

01:17:51.313 --> 01:17:55.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the discerning man draws them out.”

01:17:55.158 --> 01:17:57.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the thoughts of the student

01:17:57.164 --> 01:18:00.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not always easily discernible.

01:18:00.716 --> 01:18:04.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it really takes a skilled teacher

01:18:04.477 --> 01:18:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw those out “like deep waters,”
the verse indicates.

01:18:09.492 --> 01:18:13.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through tactful questions, then,
you can help your student

01:18:13.462 --> 01:18:16.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to examine how they feel

01:18:16.554 --> 01:18:18.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what they are learning.

01:18:18.936 --> 01:18:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some simple questions will help you do that.

01:18:22.405 --> 01:18:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, How do you feel about . . . ?

01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:30.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or What convinces you that . . . ?

01:18:30.763 --> 01:18:35.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or How would you react if . . . ?

01:18:35.694 --> 01:18:37.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, those are excellent questions

01:18:37.783 --> 01:18:42.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help to draw up the inner feelings
of your student.

01:18:42.339 --> 01:18:44.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s a caution in this process

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:47.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because generally it’s going to take time

01:18:47.562 --> 01:18:49.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gain the trust of the student

01:18:49.903 --> 01:18:53.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they’ll be comfortable
expressing their feelings.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a student’s love for Jehovah increases,

01:18:57.592 --> 01:19:01.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll be motivated
to make changes in their lives

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to please Jehovah God.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 5:3 says:

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what the love of God means,

01:19:10.589 --> 01:19:13.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we observe his commandments.”

01:19:13.848 --> 01:19:17.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So obedience to his commandments, then,

01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:19.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is linked to love for him and,

01:19:19.741 --> 01:19:23.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in addition, love for fellow humans.

01:19:23.167 --> 01:19:26.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love for the Bible teachings
that they’re learning is going to help

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:30.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
them to make any needed adjustments
to their thinking.

01:19:30.773 --> 01:19:33.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than shame your student,

01:19:33.824 --> 01:19:36.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help them to reason

01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:40.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the benefits
of correcting wrong viewpoints.

01:19:40.552 --> 01:19:45.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall how Neeta
handled the situation with Jade?

01:19:45.316 --> 01:19:49.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jade said Jehovah’s law
against having sex before marriage

01:19:49.955 --> 01:19:53.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was “totally archaic,”

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of scolding her,

01:19:56.683 --> 01:20:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta skillfully used an example of a child

01:20:00.904 --> 01:20:05.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not understanding the rules
and regulations of the parent.

01:20:05.417 --> 01:20:08.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you could see as she was discussing that,

01:20:08.217 --> 01:20:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade started to make the connection
that Jehovah’s law

01:20:13.065 --> 01:20:16.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is really an expression of his love for her,

01:20:16.701 --> 01:20:20.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as a parent loves their child.

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:26.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once a student develops
this relationship with Jehovah God

01:20:26.061 --> 01:20:30.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and desires to make Jehovah’s heart happy,

01:20:30.282 --> 01:20:34.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to be the strongest motive

01:20:34.127 --> 01:20:37.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the individual to make
whatever changes are necessary

01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their life to please Jehovah.

01:20:42.318 --> 01:20:47.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it is a privilege to be involved
in the work of making disciples,

01:20:47.249 --> 01:20:51.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to also enjoy this work.

01:20:51.219 --> 01:20:54.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was certainly the case
with the apostle Paul.

01:20:54.729 --> 01:20:59.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bible to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:01.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 19 and 20.

01:21:01.667 --> 01:21:05.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s see how he felt
about God’s message

01:21:05.804 --> 01:21:09.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changing the lives
of those who he preached to.

01:21:09.816 --> 01:21:13.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20:

01:21:16.084 --> 01:21:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For what is our hope
or joy or crown of exaltation

01:21:19.929 --> 01:21:22.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before our Lord Jesus at his presence?

01:21:22.687 --> 01:21:25.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it not in fact you?

01:21:25.111 --> 01:21:30.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You certainly are our glory and joy.”

01:21:30.167 --> 01:21:35.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Few joys in life can compare
with helping someone come

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an accurate knowledge of the truth
and watching them progress

01:21:39.654 --> 01:21:42.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedication and baptism.

01:21:42.872 --> 01:21:47.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so thankful to receive
Jehovah’s holy spirit

01:21:47.552 --> 01:21:52.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his guidance in helping us
in this disciple-making work.

01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we too must do our part

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in diligently improving in our skills.

01:21:59.379 --> 01:22:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As this six-part symposium has highlighted,

01:22:03.432 --> 01:22:08.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we do our part
improving our teaching skills

01:22:08.029 --> 01:22:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all aspects of our ministry,

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will find greater joy

01:22:13.378 --> 01:22:16.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “God’s fellow workers.”

01:22:18.101 --> 01:22:21.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for those instructive talks.

01:22:21.527 --> 01:22:25.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt all of us could see areas
in which we can improve as teachers.

01:22:27.378 --> 01:22:30.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please stand now, if you are able to do so,

01:22:30.094 --> 01:22:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let us sing together song number 58,

01:22:32.936 --> 01:22:36.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is entitled
“Searching for Friends of Peace.”

01:22:36.948 --> 01:22:39.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s song number 58.

Can you imagine
how Adam must have felt

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he
was introduced to Eve?

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:15.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we don’t have
to imagine how he felt.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:20.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that he
was overwhelmed with appreciation.

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:22.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he expressed his appreciation

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in poetic terms
that are recorded in the Bible.

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:31.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember the words:
“This is at last

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:36.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bone of my bone
and flesh of my flesh.”

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:38.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:42.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam and Eve
had a perfect marriage,

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:47.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and together
they formed a perfect family.

00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:52.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, with their disobedience,
all of that changed.

00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:55.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of perfection,

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:59.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were confronted
with one another’s imperfections.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the instant that they
separated themselves from Jehovah,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:08.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began to experience
stress and anxiety

00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:12.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that affected their relationship.

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a testimony to Jehovah’s love

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:20.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wisdom
that despite imperfections

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:23.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and despite
the stress and anxiety

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:27.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have only intensified
in these last days,

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:31.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the family can still
be a source of joy

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a place of security
and stability.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for that to happen,

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each member of the family
must shoulder his load

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:46.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Scriptural responsibility.

00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:48.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to consider husbands,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wives, parents, and children,

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how each of us can contribute

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the joy of the family.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To start,

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s address husbands.

00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are a husband,

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you view your wife?

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view her as Jehovah does?

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view her and feel about her

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:27.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Adam felt about Eve

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he first met her?

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:34.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Bible helps
us husbands appreciate

00:02:34.473 --> 00:02:38.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our wives
are a gift from Jehovah.

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you appreciate the gift?

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:47.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And are you demonstrating
your appreciation?

00:02:47.612 --> 00:02:52.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a few minutes this morning,
we’re going to consider four ways

00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:55.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we husbands
can demonstrate

00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:59.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciation for the gift
Jehovah has given us.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:03.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re taking notes,
here they are:

00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:06.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) It’s important that we assign

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:09.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wives honor;

00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:14.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we must invest time

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:17.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our relationship;

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:21.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) it’s important that we confine

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our romantic interests to our wife;

00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:27.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (4)

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to be realistic
in our expectations.

00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:36.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider these points
one at a time.

00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:41.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, in your Bible
to 1 Peter chapter 3,

00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:46.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 7:

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:52.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You husbands, in the same way,

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:56.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continue dwelling with them
according to knowledge.

00:03:56.684 --> 00:04:01.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Assign them honor
as to a weaker vessel,

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the feminine one,
since they are also heirs

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with you
of the undeserved favor of life,

00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:13.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order for your prayers
not to be hindered.”

00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:17.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Peter leaves us in no doubt

00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to who is being addressed,
“you husbands.”

00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:25.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s you and me.

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:29.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He tells us that we
must continue dwelling

00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:33.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our wives
“according to knowledge.”

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote in our Bible says:
“showing them consideration;

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understanding them.”

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How well do you know your wife?

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:49.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you know
about her background, her upbringing?

00:04:49.614 --> 00:04:52.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know
what makes her happy.

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:54.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know why?

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know what’s upsetting to her,

00:04:57.414 --> 00:05:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what causes anxiety.

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:03.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you understand why?

00:05:03.128 --> 00:05:06.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important
that we take the time

00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:10.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to know our wives
because only then

00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:14.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can we care for their physical,

00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:18.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotional, and spiritual needs.

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:23.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only then can we do
what Peter next says in the verse,

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:25.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s our main point:

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Assign them honor.”

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:32.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assign your wife honor.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Peter says
“as to a weaker vessel.”

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does Peter mean

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:44.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he refers
to the wife as a weaker vessel?

00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:49.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think he’s betraying
some chauvinistic leaning?

00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:51.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:55.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s already said
‘assign her honor.’

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate it this way:

00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that you have two bowls

00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:04.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly the same size,

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly the same capacity,

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:10.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but one is made of wood

00:06:10.824 --> 00:06:14.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other is made of a very fine,

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:17.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very expensive porcelain

00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:19.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both bowls,

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:23.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both with the same capacity.

00:06:23.504 --> 00:06:26.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would you handle both
in the same way?

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:28.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:33.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recognize that the porcelain
is more valuable

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:35.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more fragile,

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:39.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you handle it
in a different way.

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:43.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Peter
is telling us about our wives.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is the “weaker vessel,
the feminine one.”

00:06:48.488 --> 00:06:51.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way is she weaker?

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly not intellectually,

00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:56.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and certainly not spiritually.

00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:59.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Primarily in a physical sense,

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we husbands have an advantage.

00:07:04.713 --> 00:07:07.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we accord our wife honor.

00:07:07.883 --> 00:07:12.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we would never
get physical with her,

00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:15.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and certainly we would never

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:20.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a pretext pretend
to honor her in public

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then abuse her
in some way in private.

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that would never work,
would it?

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:35.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We assign her honor at all times.

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:37.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s why.

00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:40.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter says:
“They are also heirs with you

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:44.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the undeserved favor of life.”

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands and wives
are on equal footing

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:50.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah
in a spiritual sense.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both husbands and wives
must “[wash] their robes

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [make] them white
in the blood of the Lamb.”

00:07:57.268 --> 00:08:00.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not die
more for husbands

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than he did for wives.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And both husbands and wives

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:10.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have the hope of everlasting life.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we remember that.

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:17.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t,
how does Peter conclude?

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In order for your prayers

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:22.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be hindered.”

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:

00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:30.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dealings with our wife
will have a direct impact

00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:34.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our personal relationship
with Jehovah.

00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:37.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So assign her honor.

00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:40.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Value what she does for you

00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:45.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for your family,
and demonstrate your appreciation.

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:47.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second point:

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:50.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Invest time in your relationship.

00:08:52.242 --> 00:08:55.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so easy—isn’t it?—
for secular work,

00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:59.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic assignments,
and association with others

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:02.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rob us of valuable time

00:09:02.128 --> 00:09:05.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that should be spent
with our wives.

00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:12.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, when we
were getting to know one another, courting,

00:09:12.764 --> 00:09:16.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were anxious
for one-on-one time.

00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:20.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That shouldn’t change
when we get married.

00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:23.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So buy out the time,

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:27.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set it aside, and stick to it.

00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:31.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that way,
you demonstrate your appreciation

00:09:31.241 --> 00:09:34.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the gift Jehovah
has given you.

00:09:34.662 --> 00:09:39.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third point is highlighted
in Proverbs chapter 5.

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:41.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So turn there with me, please.

00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:46.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs chapter 5
—and we’ll begin reading in verse 18:

00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:53.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May your own fountain be blessed,
[and here’s the point]

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and may you rejoice

00:09:57.268 --> 00:09:59.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the wife of your youth,

00:09:59.854 --> 00:10:04.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a loving doe,
a graceful mountain goat.

00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:08.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let her breasts
satisfy you at all times.

00:10:08.488 --> 00:10:11.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then here
again is the point]

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you be captivated
by her love constantly.”

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the point?

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:23.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must confine
our romantic interests

00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:25.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our wife.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no other option.

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:33.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to “rejoice
with the wife of [our] youth.”

00:10:33.097 --> 00:10:36.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to “be captivated
by her love.”

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means avoiding
overly-close relationships with other women,

00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:46.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not just physical relationships
—texting,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
videoconferencing,
telephone calls

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all constitute a relationship.

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:55.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re very careful.

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:58.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We set limits,
and we don’t go beyond them.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And confining
our romantic interests to our wife

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes rejecting

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sexual fantasies involving others.

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:13.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world makes light
of such fantasizing.

00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:16.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus helped us to appreciate

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s a very serious matter.

00:11:19.396 --> 00:11:23.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recall his words
in the Sermon on the Mount?

00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:27.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Anyone] who keeps on looking

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:30.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at a woman
so as to have a passion for her

00:11:30.658 --> 00:11:34.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has already committed adultery
 . . . in his heart.”

00:11:34.286 --> 00:11:36.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:

00:11:36.288 --> 00:11:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fantasizing is little more
than rehearsing.

00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:43.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we reject such fantasies

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:46.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that they
violate Bible counsel,

00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:50.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including Jesus’ very pointed advice.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they can prevent us
from rejoicing in our wife.

00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:59.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, (4)

00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:03.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be realistic in your expectations.

00:12:03.108 --> 00:12:05.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We husbands are not perfect.

00:12:05.486 --> 00:12:07.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that.

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:10.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our wives are not perfect.

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you appreciate it when your wife

00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:18.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smooths over your imperfections
and makes you look good?

00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:23.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our wives appreciate it
when we do that for them.

00:12:23.338 --> 00:12:27.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be alert
for opportunities to do that.

00:12:27.634 --> 00:12:30.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:34.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the husband
rejoices in his wife.

00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:41.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was trying to get caught up on paperwork
for the circuit overseer’s visit.

00:12:42.107 --> 00:12:44.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was so much to do.

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:51.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to be kidding me.

00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:57.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re home early, Honey.

00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:02.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sensed something was wrong.

00:13:03.338 --> 00:13:06.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kids had left a few things out,
and I was a bit preoccupied.

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:10.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tough day?

00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were supposed to talk
to the girls about this.

00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:15.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re making it a habit.

00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:29.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I thought about it, though,
I realized it wasn’t just the kitchen.

00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I was part of the problem.

00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:39.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe the problem was me.

00:13:41.336 --> 00:13:44.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, my wife
is an amazing woman,

00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so loving.

00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:05.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be an understatement
to call her industrious.

00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there’s her infectious joy.

00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:21.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, how could I not love her?

00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:28.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes it takes
more than saying, “I love you.”

00:14:28.593 --> 00:14:32.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Honey, you’re right.

00:14:32.722 --> 00:14:35.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is completely unacceptable.

00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to the girls
as soon as they come through that door.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:14:41.357 --> 00:14:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:51.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the husband
in the video rejoiced in his wife?

00:14:51.242 --> 00:14:55.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reflected
on her many good works

00:14:55.747 --> 00:14:58.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—her devotion to Jehovah,

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good acts
that she performed for others,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her fine work
in behalf of her family,

00:15:05.215 --> 00:15:07.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her spontaneous joy

00:15:07.634 --> 00:15:10.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that made her
even more beautiful to him.

00:15:10.137 --> 00:15:12.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as he reflected

00:15:12.597 --> 00:15:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all of those fine things,
what happened?

00:15:16.018 --> 00:15:19.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His appreciation
for his gift deepened,

00:15:19.938 --> 00:15:24.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was motivated
to do something about it.

00:15:24.819 --> 00:15:28.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a beautiful example for us.

00:15:28.823 --> 00:15:32.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So rejoice in your wife

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:34.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by assigning her honor,

00:15:34.537 --> 00:15:37.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by investing time
in your relationship,

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by confining
your romantic interests to your wife,

00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:45.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by being realistic
in your expectations.

00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:48.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, your marriage

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:51.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your family
will continue to be

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:54.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a source of joy,
a place of stability,

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a place of security.

00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:00.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Patrick LaFranca,

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Personnel Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk
of the symposium,

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cultivate Joy in Your Family

00:16:09.824 --> 00:16:13.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Wives, Rejoice
in Your Husband.”

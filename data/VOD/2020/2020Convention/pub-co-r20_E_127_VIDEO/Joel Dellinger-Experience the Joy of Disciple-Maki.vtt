00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:08.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible identifies a second source
of help that Jehovah has given us

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can experience
the joy of making disciples.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:17.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gift is described at 1 Peter 5:9.

00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:19.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read that with me

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 5:9:

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:28.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But take your stand
against him, firm in the faith,

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:31.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that the same kind
of sufferings are being experienced

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:36.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the entire association
of your brothers

00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:38.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the world.”

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:40.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope has Jehovah given us?

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our worldwide association
of brothers and sisters.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as their example can help us to endure,

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:53.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers can also help us
meet the challenges in the ministry.

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:57.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah has given us
a large spiritual family,

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that shows that he wants us

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:03.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to experience the joy of working together.

00:01:03.253 --> 00:01:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we might be thinking,

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:07.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s encouraging, but is it realistic

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think that I can experience the joy
of making a disciple?’

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve had Bible studies

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but none of them have yet progressed
to the point of dedication and baptism.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you might wonder,

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I really up to that challenge?’

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re a parent
who’s newer in the truth,

00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:28.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re thinking to yourself,

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:31.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I reach my child’s heart

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:35.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help him or her learn
to love Jehovah as I do?’

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:38.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re dealing with poor health

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the effects of old age, and you wonder,

00:01:41.627 --> 00:01:45.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can I have an effective ministry?’

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:50.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we want you to take heart.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has provided help,

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:55.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help may be nearer than you think.

00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:59.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To highlight the help
that Jehovah gives to all of us,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a few moments,
let’s consider the apostle Paul’s experience.

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:08.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think of the apostle Paul,
what comes to mind?

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps a very hardworking, energetic brother

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:14.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who traveled extensively as a missionary.

00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:19.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can there be any doubt
that Paul’s ministry was a complete success?

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:22.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was Paul’s success

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the result of his efforts alone?

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:27.884 --> 00:02:31.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul needed
and humbly accepted help from others.

00:02:31.304 --> 00:02:33.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may recall reading

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:36.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Acts chapters 16 and 17,

00:02:36.184 --> 00:02:39.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the man Silas traveled with Paul.

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:42.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that trip, in the city of Philippi,

00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:47.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul and Silas shared the joy
of helping an entire family

00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:49.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become baptized disciples.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:53.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s something very interesting
in the Bible’s record of that account:

00:02:53.953 --> 00:02:56.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time Paul is mentioned,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Silas is mentioned as well.

00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:02.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the expression “Paul and Silas”

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurs six times in quick succession.

00:03:05.548 --> 00:03:07.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from that?

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:10.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Paul had help in his ministry.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not go it alone.

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:15.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, young ones, a question for you:

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of another close friend of Paul

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:21.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who often traveled with him?

00:03:21.857 --> 00:03:24.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You got it right, Timothy.

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For about 14 years, the two of them

00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:30.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked together in Jehovah’s service.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Paul, the more experienced man,

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really view Timothy as a helper,
as someone who could assist him?

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:40.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he did.

00:03:40.168 --> 00:03:43.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul neared the end
of his life, for example,

00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he wrote to Timothy, his younger friend,

00:03:45.924 --> 00:03:50.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said: “Do your utmost
to come to me shortly.”

00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:55.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was not too proud to ask for help.

00:03:55.809 --> 00:04:00.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Acts chapter 18,
the Bible tells us about a married couple

00:04:00.564 --> 00:04:05.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, or Prisca)
who supported Paul.

00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:10.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the city of Corinth,
they welcomed Paul not only into their home

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also into the business of making tents.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:19.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine
how much joy these three must have had

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they worked together
not only in the secular trade of making tents

00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:27.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in advancing
the Kingdom good news?

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:29.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when Paul left Corinth,

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:32.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know what happened
with Aquila and Priscilla?

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:35.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They followed him to Ephesus.

00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:38.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, Aquila and Priscilla used their home

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a meeting place
for the local congregation.

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their helpful services continued.

00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:47.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 18:24,

00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:50.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned that this couple
became acquainted with Apollos

00:04:50.534 --> 00:04:54.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Christian from Egypt who,
according to the Scriptural account,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an “eloquent man”
and “well-versed in the Scriptures.”

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:03.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, Apollos needed some help

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had some gaps
in his understanding.

00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:11.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did helpful Priscilla and Aquila do?

00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 18:26 tells us:

00:05:14.517 --> 00:05:17.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They took [Apollos] into their company

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:21.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explained the way
of God more accurately to him.”

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think of that for a moment.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This humble couple, tentmakers,

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:29.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not intimidated by Apollos.

00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:33.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To them, he was a brother
—a part of the family.

00:05:33.078 --> 00:05:36.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And out of brotherly love,
they took the initiative

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give him the help that he needed.

00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:41.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in thinking about Paul

00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he viewed those that assisted him,

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:48.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you think he felt
about this beautiful couple?

00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:52.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible with me
to Paul’s own words that Jehovah preserved

00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:56.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 16:3, 4.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 16:3, 4;

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read it together:

00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:08.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give my greetings
to Prisca [or, Priscilla] and Aquila,

00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:11.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:15.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who have risked their own necks for me
and to whom not only I

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also all the congregations
of the nations give thanks.”

00:06:20.294 --> 00:06:24.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deep appreciation
is what Paul felt for this loyal couple.

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:29.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He viewed them as his fellow workers.

00:06:29.262 --> 00:06:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does all of what we’ve discussed

00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:34.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell us about the apostle Paul?

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the success
he enjoyed in his ministry

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:42.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not the result of his efforts alone.

00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:45.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave Paul the help he needed

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have an effective ministry,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that help came in the form
of many brothers and sisters.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given you and given me

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same help—our brothers.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please notice how Neeta benefits

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the help of another sister.

00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:21.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve tried everything
to get Jade to a meeting . . .

00:07:24.195 --> 00:07:26.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s every Thursday and Sunday,
and I think

00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:28.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I think you’d really enjoy it.

00:07:28.783 --> 00:07:31.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t promise anything.

00:07:31.286 --> 00:07:34.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be nice if you could come.

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might just text her,
actually, just to remind her.

00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:45.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, yeah, excellent.

00:07:48.554 --> 00:07:53.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried bringing
other people on the study?

00:07:54.727 --> 00:07:56.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . well, maybe not everything.

00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:20.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:20.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:22.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Abigay.

00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:23.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.
Hi, Abigay.

00:08:23.883 --> 00:08:25.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, let me kill that.

00:08:33.017 --> 00:08:35.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a long time since I hear them!

00:08:37.146 --> 00:08:38.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that band?

00:08:38.606 --> 00:08:39.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know them?

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:44.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to see them all the time
before I became a Witness.

00:08:44.196 --> 00:08:46.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way!
You like that kind of music?

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:48.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t believe me?

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:56.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, this bag, it’s so big!

00:08:59.462 --> 00:09:02.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t find anything.

00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abigay?

00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:10.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, when I was young . . .

00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:15.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were in a band?

00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:20.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The sun shines so sweet.”

00:09:20.484 --> 00:09:21.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I love that song!

00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:23.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually have that vinyl.

00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:32.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll be gone next week.

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:34.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:35.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ll have someone else
take care of the study, OK?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Neeta responded
to the suggestion that was given her?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Applying that counsel brought good results.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Neeta, we may need specific help

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish our ministry fully.

00:10:24.134 --> 00:10:26.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when it comes

00:10:26.136 --> 00:10:29.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to making return visits
and conducting Bible studies,

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:32.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could some brothers and sisters
in your congregation

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:35.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help you to improve your skills?

00:10:35.437 --> 00:10:37.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, all of us would benefit

00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:40.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reaching out to such publishers

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have gained experience
and skill in those aspects of the ministry.

00:10:45.865 --> 00:10:48.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’re a parent

00:10:48.034 --> 00:10:52.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wants to instill love for Jehovah
in the heart of your child?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about asking some other parents

00:10:54.207 --> 00:10:57.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or grandparents for advice?

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’ve had success raising their children

00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:02.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah
and become baptized disciples,

00:11:02.883 --> 00:11:06.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will certainly be happy
to share their experience with you.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what if we have
age limitations or health concerns,

00:11:12.935 --> 00:11:17.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may need practical assistance
that accommodates our needs.

00:11:17.815 --> 00:11:22.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at many Bethel homes,
elderly and infirm brothers and sisters

00:11:22.403 --> 00:11:26.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are still having a regular
and productive share in the ministry.

00:11:26.074 --> 00:11:28.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how?

00:11:28.118 --> 00:11:31.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders at Bethel
arrange for younger publishers

00:11:31.246 --> 00:11:35.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join the elderly ones
in letter writing and phone witnessing.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister by the name of Nancy,

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:41.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was nearly 90 years old
at the time, said this:

00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:44.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t view letter writing
as just stuffing envelopes.

00:11:44.426 --> 00:11:46.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is field service.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to know the truth!”

00:11:49.515 --> 00:11:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging!

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:56.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you know that in less than a year,
one group of precious older ones

00:11:56.272 --> 00:12:00.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devoted over 1,000 hours to the ministry,

00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote over 6,000 letters,

00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:04.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made over 2,000 phone calls,

00:12:04.698 --> 00:12:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and placed over 6,000 pieces of literature?

00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:11.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What good was accomplished
by working together,

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what joy they experienced!

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:17.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we have to admit

00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:22.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it takes humility
to acknowledge that we need help.

00:12:22.717 --> 00:12:25.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in this, we can learn from Apollos.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though eloquent
and though well-versed in the Scriptures,

00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:32.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he accepted the help that he needed.

00:12:32.143 --> 00:12:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, he benefited

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:37.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all those that he would teach
thereafter benefited.

00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:40.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s the point:

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of someone
like Priscilla or Aquila

00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:47.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could give you the help you need?

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:51.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, why not explain your needs
and ask that person

00:12:51.914 --> 00:12:56.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join you in the ministry
or on Bible studies.

00:12:56.711 --> 00:13:00.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’ve been serving
Jehovah for a time,

00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you in a position to help others?

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:06.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, we encourage you to be observant

00:13:06.763 --> 00:13:09.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take the initiative to offer assistance.

00:13:09.474 --> 00:13:12.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you see that a brother
or sister would benefit

00:13:12.143 --> 00:13:15.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a kind suggestion, don’t hold back.

00:13:15.522 --> 00:13:18.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At an appropriate time,
you might begin the conversation

00:13:18.942 --> 00:13:20.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a friendly way by saying:

00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:23.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘May I offer you a suggestion?’

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘Here’s what I try to do.’

00:13:26.033 --> 00:13:30.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, if we’re kind
and thoughtful like Aquila and Priscilla,

00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:35.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely our words and example
will prove to be a blessing

00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:39.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our brothers find joy
in making disciples too.

00:13:39.213 --> 00:13:43.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the second part of this symposium,
what have we learned?

00:13:43.718 --> 00:13:47.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our brothers are a gift from Jehovah

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us make disciples.

00:13:49.933 --> 00:13:54.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, when we
work together and support one another,

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:59.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us can find
great joy in our precious ministry.

00:14:00.486 --> 00:14:03.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:14:03.864 --> 00:14:07.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the third
and final talk of this symposium,

00:14:07.243 --> 00:14:10.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making—

00:14:10.496 --> 00:14:13.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept Jehovah’s Help—Prayer.”

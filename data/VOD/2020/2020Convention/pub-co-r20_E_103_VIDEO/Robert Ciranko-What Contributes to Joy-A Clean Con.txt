00:00:02 What would you do if you were tempted or pressured
00:00:06 to commit some sort of wrongdoing?
00:00:08 There are many people in the world
00:00:10 who would give in to the temptation or the pressure,
00:00:12 especially if they felt that they could benefit in some way
00:00:15 and they thought that no one would find out about it.
00:00:18 But would doing that really contribute to a person’s joy?
00:00:23 In the previous talk, we saw a dramatization
00:00:26 of a brother named Ben.
00:00:28 At first, he chose to accept a promotion at work that put him under great stress.
00:00:33 Let’s take another look at him in that position
00:00:36 and see how he handles things when his boss
00:00:40 pressures him to be dishonest.
00:00:49 Hey, Ben, it looks like you forgot to sign off on a job order.
00:00:55 Actually,
00:00:57 these failed that quality inspection.
00:00:59 Remember?
00:01:00 Yeah, by like two tenths of a point.
00:01:03 Yeah, I already talked to Steve about replacing the components,
00:01:05 and we’re going to get that order adjusted,
00:01:08 and I’ll have a new one for you on your desk tomorrow afternoon.
00:01:16 Ben,
00:01:17 there’s no time for that.
00:01:19 This is a huge account.
00:01:21 If you don’t sign off on this,
00:01:22 you’d be hurting the whole company.
00:01:25 What?
00:01:28 Victor, I’m-I’m not sure
00:01:31 that I’m really comfortable
00:01:35 bypassing the inspection when . . .
00:01:38 Ben, I’m not asking you to tell some big lie.
00:01:41 This is a technicality.
00:01:44 Remember, a good quarter
00:01:47 means good bonuses for everyone
00:01:49 —including you.
00:01:55 I didn’t want to do it,
00:01:57 but the last thing that Lisa and I needed
00:02:01 was for me to lose my job.
00:02:10 I really didn’t have a choice.
00:02:14 If you lie, they can’t believe you.
00:02:19 And they might not . . .
00:02:20 I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.
00:02:23 All lies are bad, even little ones.
00:02:26 One lie leads to another, and they cause much harm.
00:02:38 It’s simple, right?
00:02:42 Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.
00:02:49 Did you hear what Ben said?
00:02:52 “I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.”
00:02:55 But if that were really true,
00:02:57 then why was he so uncomfortable about what he had done?
00:03:01 It is because wrongdoing does not lead to true joy.
00:03:05 Ben’s conscience was not clean.
00:03:08 It was telling him that Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.
00:03:13 And what is the conscience?
00:03:16 A young boy was asked that question, and he said,
00:03:19 “When you’re good, you don’t even know you have it,
00:03:22 but when you’re bad, it hurts.”
00:03:25 Another child said that in her head there was a green light
00:03:29 and a red light, and that when she was told to do something that she knew was wrong,
00:03:33 the red light would flash.
00:03:36 Well, they both had the right idea.
00:03:38 Our conscience is our inner sense of right and wrong
00:03:43 that Jehovah instilled in us.
00:03:45 And the Bible says that it is like a ‘law written in the human heart.’
00:03:50 Speaking of people in general,
00:03:53 look at what Romans 2:15 says,
00:03:55 as it explains the function of the conscience.
00:03:58 That’s Romans 2:15:
00:04:02 “They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law
00:04:06 “to be written in their hearts,
00:04:09 “while their conscience is bearing witness with them,
00:04:12 “and by their own thoughts they are being accused
00:04:15 or even excused.”
00:04:18 Jehovah gave us a conscience so that we can evaluate
00:04:22 any situation that arises in life,
00:04:25 make a right choice, and then judge ourselves afterward
00:04:28 on the choice we made.
00:04:30 If we allow ourselves to do what we know is wrong,
00:04:33 our conscience will surely strike us.
00:04:37 Then, if we repeatedly ignore our conscience,
00:04:40 it will malfunction and become insensitive
00:04:42 and it will not recognize dangers that could damage
00:04:46 our relationship with Jehovah.
00:04:49 The first time a person does something he knows he should not do,
00:04:52 his conscience may prick him and he may feel guilty.
00:04:56 But if he does it again and again,
00:04:58 his conscience will gradually fail to respond,
00:05:01 and he may get involved in even more serious wrongdoing.
00:05:05 Seemingly small compromises often lead to larger ones,
00:05:09 and larger compromises further distance people
00:05:12 from the happy God,
00:05:14 and that leads to feelings of worthlessness and heartache.
00:05:19 Whereas a clean conscience that results from obeying Jehovah
00:05:23 brings us self-respect,
00:05:26 personal dignity, and real joy.
00:05:29 Now, how can we safeguard our conscience
00:05:32 so that it is always clean?
00:05:34 By studying Bible principles and meditating on how to apply them,
00:05:39 so that when we are faced with important decisions,
00:05:42 we will know how to respond in a way
00:05:45 that will contribute to our joy.
00:05:48 We have to sensitize our conscience
00:05:50 by learning and loving Jehovah’s view of what is right and what is wrong
00:05:55 and by being convinced that living in harmony
00:05:58 with his standards is the best way of life.
00:06:01 And that is how the psalmist David felt.
00:06:04 If you’d like to turn to Psalm 19:8,
00:06:08 Psalm 19:8, he wrote:
00:06:11 “The orders from Jehovah are righteous,
00:06:14 “causing the heart to rejoice;
00:06:16 “the commandment of Jehovah is clean,
00:06:19 making the eyes shine.”
00:06:23 So maintaining a clean conscience in all areas of our daily life
00:06:27 will bring us joy—in our use of alcohol, in business dealings,
00:06:31 with entertainment choices,
00:06:33 and in our dealings with the opposite sex.
00:06:37 And when we have a clean conscience, as Jehovah’s people,
00:06:41 we are not ashamed to give a witness to others.
00:06:44 As the apostle Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 1:12,
00:06:47 we can boast that “our conscience bears witness
00:06:50 “that we have conducted ourselves in the world . . . with holiness
00:06:54 and godly sincerity.”
00:06:56 At times, it takes real courage to be honest
00:07:00 and to face whatever consequences may come our way.
00:07:03 As you watch the following dramatization,
00:07:06 see how Ben benefits from being honest.
00:07:15 Hey, Javi.
00:07:16 Hey, Ben. How are you doing?
00:07:17 Good. How’s the job going?
00:07:18 Oh, the machine is running great!
00:07:19 Ben, I did have a question on the specs for the Harrison job.
00:07:21 Can we take a quick look?
00:07:22 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:07:24 Uh, let’s see here.
00:07:26 Need a hand?
00:07:27 No, I’m good. I just . . .
00:07:32 Oh, no!
00:07:36 What happened, guys?
00:07:40 We got—we got to do something!
00:07:42 Um, disconnect . . .
00:07:44 OK. Yeah, yeah, get it going.
00:07:53 Dead
00:07:54 —I’m pretty sure it’s dead.
00:07:58 I would just say that it stopped working.
00:08:00 Whatever you do, don’t tell Victor what happened.
00:08:14 We just got this set up last month.
00:08:17 Why would it just stop working?
00:08:19 It could happen.
00:08:22 Oh, you can actually smell
00:08:25 the coffee.
00:08:28 I’ll talk to Victor.
00:08:30 Don’t throw yourself under the bus, Man!
00:08:31 We’ll help you get this cleaned up.
00:08:33 No one will have to know.
00:08:34 This is one of the most expensive units in the shop.
00:08:38 If you take the blame,
00:08:39 you’re just making yourself look bad.
00:08:44 No. It’s OK.
00:08:46 It was a mistake.
00:08:48 I’ll explain it.
00:08:50 We need to get this back online.
00:09:18 In the end, I think Victor actually appreciated my honesty.
00:09:25 And he wasn’t the only one.
00:09:28 Mark had some questions,
00:09:31 and we had a great discussion.
00:09:41 This time, instead of his conscience troubling him,
00:09:44 Ben had real peace of mind.
00:09:46 He also gained the trust and respect of others.
00:09:49 How can you have a clean conscience?
00:09:52 By being determined, as Hebrews 13:18 says,
00:09:56 ‘to conduct yourselves honestly in all things,’
00:10:00 whether other humans are aware of your good conduct or not.
00:10:04 Then you can sleep each night with the satisfaction of knowing
00:10:08 that Jehovah is pleased with you.
00:10:11 As they say, ‘There is no pillow so soft as a clean conscience.’
00:10:16 It rewards us with peace of mind and joy.
00:10:20 Besides a clean conscience, what else brings true joy?
00:10:24 Listen as Brother William Malenfant, a helper to the Teaching Committee,
00:10:28 considers the next talk of this symposium,
00:10:31 “What Contributes to Joy? —Meaningful Work.”

What would you do
if you were tempted or pressured

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to commit
some sort of wrongdoing?

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many people
in the world

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would give in
to the temptation or the pressure,

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:15.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if they felt that they
could benefit in some way

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:18.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they thought that no one
would find out about it.

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would doing that
really contribute to a person’s joy?

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the previous talk,
we saw a dramatization

00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a brother named Ben.

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:33.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, he chose to accept a promotion
at work that put him under great stress.

00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:36.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take another look
at him in that position

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how he handles
things when his boss

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:43.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pressures him to be dishonest.

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:52.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben, it looks like you forgot
to sign off on a job order.

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:57.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these failed that quality inspection.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:00:59.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember?

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, by like two tenths of a point.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I already talked to Steve
about replacing the components,

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to get that order adjusted,

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll have a new one for you
on your desk tomorrow afternoon.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no time for that.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a huge account.

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:22.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t sign off on this,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d be hurting the whole company.

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:31.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Victor, I’m-I’m not sure

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m really comfortable

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:38.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bypassing the inspection when . . .

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I’m not asking you to tell some big lie.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:43.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a technicality.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, a good quarter

00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means good bonuses for everyone

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:51.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including you.

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:57.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to do it,

00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:01.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the last thing that Lisa and I needed

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for me to lose my job.

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:12.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t have a choice.

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:16.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you lie, they can’t believe you.

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:20.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they might not . . .

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:23.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept telling myself
that it was no big deal.

00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:26.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All lies are bad, even little ones.

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:31.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One lie leads to another,
and they cause much harm.

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:40.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s simple, right?

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.

00:02:49.993 --> 00:02:52.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear what Ben said?

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I kept telling myself
that it was no big deal.”

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if that were really true,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why was he so uncomfortable
about what he had done?

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is because wrongdoing
does not lead to true joy.

00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:08.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben’s conscience was not clean.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was telling him
that Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the conscience?

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:19.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A young boy was asked
that question, and he said,

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you’re good,
you don’t even know you have it,

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you’re bad,
it hurts.”

00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:29.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another child said that in her head
there was a green light

00:03:29.327 --> 00:03:33.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a red light, and that when she was told
to do something that she knew was wrong,

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the red light would flash.

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:38.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they both
had the right idea.

00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:43.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our conscience is our inner sense
of right and wrong

00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:45.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah instilled in us.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says that it is
like a ‘law written in the human heart.’

00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of people in general,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what Romans 2:15 says,

00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:58.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it explains
the function of the conscience.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 2:15:

00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:06.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are the very ones
who demonstrate the matter of the law

00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be written in their hearts,

00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:12.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while their conscience
is bearing witness with them,

00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:15.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and by their own thoughts
they are being accused

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even excused.”

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:22.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us a conscience
so that we can evaluate

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any situation
that arises in life,

00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:28.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a right choice,
and then judge ourselves afterward

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the choice we made.

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:33.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we allow ourselves
to do what we know is wrong,

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our conscience
will surely strike us.

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:40.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, if we repeatedly
ignore our conscience,

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:42.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will malfunction
and become insensitive

00:04:42.864 --> 00:04:46.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will not recognize
dangers that could damage

00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:49.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:52.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time a person does something
he knows he should not do,

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:56.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his conscience may prick him
and he may feel guilty.

00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:58.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if he does it
again and again,

00:04:58.547 --> 00:05:01.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his conscience
will gradually fail to respond,

00:05:01.717 --> 00:05:05.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he may get involved
in even more serious wrongdoing.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:09.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seemingly small compromises
often lead to larger ones,

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and larger compromises
further distance people

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the happy God,

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:19.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that leads to feelings
of worthlessness and heartache.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whereas a clean conscience
that results from obeying Jehovah

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings us self-respect,

00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:29.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal dignity, and real joy.

00:05:29.622 --> 00:05:32.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we
safeguard our conscience

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:34.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it is always clean?

00:05:34.877 --> 00:05:39.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By studying Bible principles
and meditating on how to apply them,

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when we are faced
with important decisions,

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will know how
to respond in a way

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:48.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will contribute
to our joy.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to sensitize
our conscience

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:55.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning and loving Jehovah’s view
of what is right and what is wrong 

00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:58.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by being convinced
that living in harmony

00:05:58.444 --> 00:06:01.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his standards
is the best way of life.

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:04.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is how
the psalmist David felt.

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:08.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to turn
to Psalm 19:8,

00:06:08.413 --> 00:06:11.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 19:8, he wrote:

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The orders
from Jehovah are righteous,

00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:16.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“causing the heart to rejoice;

00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:19.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the commandment of Jehovah is clean,

00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:23.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the eyes shine.”

00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:27.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So maintaining a clean conscience
in all areas of our daily life

00:06:27.892 --> 00:06:31.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will bring us joy—in our use of alcohol,
in business dealings,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with entertainment choices,

00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:37.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in our dealings
with the opposite sex.

00:06:37.402 --> 00:06:41.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we have a clean conscience,
as Jehovah’s people,

00:06:41.073 --> 00:06:44.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are not ashamed
to give a witness to others.

00:06:44.034 --> 00:06:47.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the apostle Paul wrote
at 2 Corinthians 1:12,

00:06:47.455 --> 00:06:50.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can boast that “our conscience
bears witness

00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have conducted ourselves
in the world . . . with holiness

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and godly sincerity.”

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, it takes
real courage to be honest

00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to face whatever consequences
may come our way.

00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:06.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how Ben benefits
from being honest.

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:16.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Javi.

00:07:16.027 --> 00:07:17.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben.
How are you doing?

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:18.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
How’s the job going?

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, the machine is running great!

00:07:19.823 --> 00:07:21.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I did have a question
on the specs for the Harrison job.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we take a quick look?

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:24.202 --> 00:07:26.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, let’s see here.

00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:27.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Need a hand?

00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:29.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m good.
I just . . .

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:34.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:38.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened, guys?

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got—we got to do something!

00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:44.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, disconnect . . .

00:07:44.224 --> 00:07:45.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
Yeah, yeah, get it going.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dead

00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:56.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I’m pretty sure it’s dead.

00:07:58.948 --> 00:08:00.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would just say that it stopped working.

00:08:00.574 --> 00:08:03.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you do,
don’t tell Victor what happened.

00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just got this set up last month.

00:08:17.885 --> 00:08:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would it just stop working?

00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could happen.

00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you can actually smell

00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the coffee.

00:08:28.145 --> 00:08:30.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to Victor.

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:31.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t throw yourself under the bus, Man!

00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:33.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll help you get this cleaned up.

00:08:33.568 --> 00:08:34.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will have to know.

00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of the most expensive
units in the shop.

00:08:38.073 --> 00:08:39.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you take the blame,

00:08:39.616 --> 00:08:41.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re just making yourself look bad.

00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:46.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
It’s OK.

00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:48.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a mistake.

00:08:48.626 --> 00:08:50.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll explain it.

00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:52.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to get this back online.

00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:22.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I think Victor
actually appreciated my honesty.

00:09:25.623 --> 00:09:27.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wasn’t the only one.

00:09:28.543 --> 00:09:30.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark had some questions,

00:09:31.964 --> 00:09:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a great discussion.

00:09:41.474 --> 00:09:44.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, instead of his conscience
troubling him,

00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:46.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben had real peace of mind.

00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:49.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also gained the trust
and respect of others.

00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you
have a clean conscience?

00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:56.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By being determined,
as Hebrews 13:18 says,

00:09:56.948 --> 00:10:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to conduct yourselves
honestly in all things,’

00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:04.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether other humans are aware
of your good conduct or not.

00:10:04.206 --> 00:10:08.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you can sleep each night
with the satisfaction of knowing

00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:11.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is pleased with you.

00:10:11.172 --> 00:10:16.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they say, ‘There is no pillow
so soft as a clean conscience.’

00:10:16.094 --> 00:10:20.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It rewards us
with peace of mind and joy.

00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:24.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides a clean conscience,
what else brings true joy?

00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:28.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as Brother William Malenfant,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:10:28.774 --> 00:10:31.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
considers the next talk
of this symposium,

00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:35.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Contributes to Joy?
—Meaningful Work.”

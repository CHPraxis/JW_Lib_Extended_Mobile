00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, let’s illustrate the importance
of helping our Bible students

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid bad association,

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll use the example
of a prospector.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a prospector
finds something valuable

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:18.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deep underground,
what does he do?

00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:21.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must make certain
that the way in is secured

00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:23.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that it’s well supported.

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:26.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, the treasure
might be plundered

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the way in could collapse.

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:32.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is similar to what
we must be aware of when it comes

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to helping our Bible students.

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work hard to reach the hearts
of responsive ones, don’t we?

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do, with Jehovah’s help,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:46.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we continue assisting them
to secure and protect their hearts.

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:50.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes protecting
their growing faith in Jehovah.

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:54.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, the Devil
will ruin what has been done

00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:56.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strip them of their faith.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:00.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we are to help our students to progress,

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:05.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must keep in mind why avoiding
bad associations is so important.

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must also have in mind

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:11.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we can help
our students to do this.

00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:15.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s first look at why
this is so important.

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:19.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order for your Bible students
to gain Jehovah’s friendship,

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:23.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will likely need to make some changes
in their choice of association.

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because your student’s progress
is greatly affected

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by his or her choice of friends.

00:01:31.577 --> 00:01:36.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 13:20
explains why this is true.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to that verse,
Proverbs 13:20.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:46.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise,

00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:51.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one who has dealings
with the stupid will fare badly.”

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:55.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does a person’s choice
of associates matter?

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:58.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we cannot change
what the verse says here

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:02.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“The one [who is] walking . . . 
[or] has dealings with the stupid

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will fare badly.”

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:07.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that our friends affect us

00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:10.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in either a good way
or a bad way, don’t they?

00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:14.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hebrew language,
to have “dealings with” someone

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can mean to “keep company” with a person,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, to be friends with a person.

00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a Bible student seeks company
with senseless people,

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she will not progress spiritually.

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it’s so important
to help our Bible students

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid the problems
that come with bad association.

00:02:34.812 --> 00:02:38.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, from Proverbs 13:20,

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:42.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn that “the one walking
with the wise will become wise.”

00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:45.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the idea of walking with someone

00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:49.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves choosing
to spend time with a person.

00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:53.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So help your Bible students
to choose well.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wholesome associates in the truth

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help your students to break free

00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:01.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from worldly thinking and unclean practices.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this in mind, now that we
have considered why we must help them,

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look some more
at how we can do so.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:14.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
note how Neeta helps her Bibles student

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:18.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seek out and select
good associates or friends.

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:23.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:33.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, but what are good associations?

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have wholesome gatherings

00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:38.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brothers and sisters
from the congregation,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we eat and talk.

00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:44.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some like to play musical instruments,
and they’ll do

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:47.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
renditions of original songs.

00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:58.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have a really nice time.

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:00.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t do that.

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:02.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not boring.

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:04.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure it’s not.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do you do?

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you wouldn’t do that.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not exactly wholesome.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you have to have fun, right?

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, and we do.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See for yourself.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m having some people
over this weekend.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:46.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t the club,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was still fun.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:31.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you take note of how Neeta helped
her Bible student to seek good friends?

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:35.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing,
she was empathetic, wasn’t she?

00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:39.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta understood that her Bible student
would need to see

00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:43.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience
some things for herself.

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, she invited her student

00:05:46.434 --> 00:05:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a gathering of brothers and sisters,

00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:53.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the impact
of that positive experience was obvious.

00:05:53.692 --> 00:05:58.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, when it comes
to how we can help our Bible students,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to be empathetic as well.

00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:03.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us naturally desire to have friends.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep that in mind
as you strive to help your students.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be difficult for them
to seek out good associates.

00:06:11.378 --> 00:06:14.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, this is all new for them.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Added to this,

00:06:16.883 --> 00:06:21.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as your students accept
and apply Bible standards in their lives,

00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:24.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of their former friends
will likely reject them.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can prepare them for this

00:06:27.061 --> 00:06:29.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing them what the Bible says,

00:06:29.564 --> 00:06:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example, at 1 Peter 4:4.

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:37.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that verse, we are made aware
that people would be “puzzled”

00:06:37.447 --> 00:06:41.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the changes we make
in order to please Jehovah.

00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:46.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also tells us that people
might “speak abusively” of us

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:49.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reject our changes.

00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:52.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could even include
members of one’s own family,

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:56.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that fact might be difficult
for your students to accept.

00:06:56.635 --> 00:07:00.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you help your students
at a time like that?

00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:03.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By giving them a real choice.

00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:07.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with helping them
to draw close to Jehovah,

00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help your students to replace
bad associations with good ones.

00:07:12.693 --> 00:07:15.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be a friend to your students.

00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:18.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Introduce them
to others in the congregation.

00:07:18.658 --> 00:07:22.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, whenever possible,
when the study is over,

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not stay for a while,
talk with them, spend some time,

00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:29.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really get to know them?

00:07:29.587 --> 00:07:33.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call your student
whenever he or she is sick.

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:35.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show personal interest.

00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sit with them at the meetings,
and invite others

00:07:38.137 --> 00:07:40.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sit in on the study with you.

00:07:40.515 --> 00:07:44.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as illustrated in the video,
like Neeta,

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
include your student
in upbuilding social activities.

00:07:48.524 --> 00:07:52.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One formerly unbelieving husband,
who is now an elder,

00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:54.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recalls how a brother helped him.

00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:57.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that the brother
took a day off from work

00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:00.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to watch a ball game with him,

00:08:00.036 --> 00:08:04.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he thought to himself,
‘He’s normal.’

00:08:04.207 --> 00:08:08.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also important to help
your Bible student understand

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:13.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that bad association
is not limited to morally debased people.

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that “the whole world

00:08:17.054 --> 00:08:20.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[the whole world] is lying

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the power of the wicked one.”

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, kindly help your students to see

00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:28.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must also avoid association

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with those who may appear to be morally clean

00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who lack faith in the true God Jehovah.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of these ways,
we see why we must help

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can help our Bible students

00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:47.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid bad associations
and accept good ones.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we must help them
to secure the way into their heart

00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:54.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and protect their faith.

00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:58.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your students do this
by avoiding bad associations,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will no doubt gain
many lifelong friends, including you.

00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:06.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whether your student is a family member

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or someone you meet in the ministry,

00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:11.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will both have precious memories

00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening song of our convention program

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminded us
that “our reasons for joy are abundant”

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that true joy “is well-founded,

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with roots reaching deep in God’s Word.”

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a tree anchors itself
in the earth’s nourishing soil,

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so true joy is anchored
in the sayings of Jehovah.

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those sayings
promise us joy that will last forever.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:32.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t it also true
that Satan’s world promises to give us joy?

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, any measure of joy
derived from things in Satan’s world

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as pursuing wealth, wrongdoing,

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extreme views of work,
or friendships in the world—

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a false joy that is short-lived.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to our illustration of the tree.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can a tree survive if its roots
have been poisoned with chemicals?

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how long will we experience joy

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we seek it
in this poisonous world of Satan?

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not long at all.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will contrast
what the world teaches about joy

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what God’s Word teaches.

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you listen and watch,
consider these questions:

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do the world’s ways
of finding joy not work?

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And am I pursuing
what truly contributes to joy?

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we’ll discuss how pursuing
a simple life contributes to joy.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world teaches that pursuing wealth
and having money will make you happy.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And an illustration of Jesus
in Luke chapter 12 highlights that point.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there with me, Luke chapter 12.

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the illustration,
the land of a rich man produced well.

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:49.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He planned on building bigger storehouses.

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:54.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, Luke 12:19,
what the man said himself:

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have many good things
stored up for many years;

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:07.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the man thought
that because of having many good things,

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:11.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could enjoy them for many years.

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice what God told him,
according to verse 20:

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unreasonable one, this night
they are demanding your life from you.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who, then, is to have the things
you stored up?”

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in reality, the man’s joy
from pursuing wealth was short-lived.

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To further illustrate this point,
as you watch the following dramatization,

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how a brother
responds to an offer of more money

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how it affects his joy.

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wanted to see me?

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, come on in and go ahead
and close the door, please.

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for coming up.

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, all of your projects have
come in on schedule and under budget.

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re really impressed, and we want
to move you up to the management team.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:14.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll head up
the whole division to start.

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Management team

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I liked the sound of that,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to mention the pay raise and the bonuses.

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did sound like a lot more work,

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Victor was so positive.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There may be a little overtime
here and there,

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wouldn’t worry about it
—not with your skill.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told me I could think
about it before deciding.

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:42.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But come on, this was a no-brainer.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new position was great!

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the money—well,

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wasn’t too bad either.

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was exciting
to work directly with clients,

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the hours

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were crazy.

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said that the easy thing to do

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:12.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the right thing
to do are seldom the same.

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see an example of this
in this week’s Bible reading.

00:04:15.984 --> 00:04:17.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True worship,

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:20.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right thing, was not easy
but required hard work.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Hezekiah demonstrated
his zeal for Jehovah’s worship . . .

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:31.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our question for the audience is,
How could we explain this to someone?

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:33.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ava, please.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most nights, I was wiped out.

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:46.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All around the world,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people wonder if life has any purpose.

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to admit

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even when I wasn’t working, . . .

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:56.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:04:56.608 --> 00:04:58.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you take this door for me?

00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:02.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty minutes.

00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:04.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working.

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:06.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As highlighted in the video,

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why will pursuing money not make us happy?

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:19.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we wouldn’t be
following Jehovah’s advice,

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:23.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would cause us
to fall into “a snare,” or trap,

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned at 1 Timothy 6:9.

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:31.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without our even realizing it,
that snare can consume our time

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:35.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—time that we need to be spending
on spiritual things.

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:38.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was that shown in the video?

00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:41.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the pay raise, bonuses,
new car, and other things

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:45.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have made our brother happy
for a short time.

00:05:45.115 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, did you notice how
pursuing money was a snare for him?

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:53.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most nights he was exhausted
from working long hours.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He arrived late
to the meeting and fell asleep.

00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice what happened
to his participation in the field ministry

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most important work on earth?

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:06.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It suffered, didn’t it?

00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:10.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t prepared, and he experienced
interruptions from his workplace.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:13.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that money is useful.

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:17.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need it to buy food,
shelter, and clothing.

00:06:17.606 --> 00:06:22.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But trading spiritual things for wealth
is always a poor investment.

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
a life focused on serving Jehovah

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a simple life
that brings deep and lasting joy.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:37.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus emphasized this
in his words at Matthew 6:22:

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:41.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, then, your eye is focused,
your whole body will be bright.”

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:47.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basic meaning of the Greek word
for “focused” is “single or simple.”

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:53.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It can convey the idea of singleness
of mind or devotion to one purpose.”

00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:58.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
if we focus our life on material things,

00:06:58.063 --> 00:07:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could take up a lot
of our time and energy,

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:05.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we may not take time
to pray, study, or preach.

00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:11.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much better to follow
Jesus’ instruction and keep our life simple!

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:15.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By focusing on putting
God’s service first in our life,

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have true joy.

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:25.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how our brother gains joy
when he makes a different decision.

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:30.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re really impressed, and we want
to move you up to the management team.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:31.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:33.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll head up
 the whole division to start.

00:07:33.432 --> 00:07:35.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Victor’s offer really took me by surprise.

00:07:39.104 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wow!

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The perks were tempting!

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew there was a lot at stake,

00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:52.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I told him I’d talk to Lisa

00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:54.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get back to him tomorrow.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:03.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was this job going to mean
for our spiritual goals?

00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:11.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would we still be able
to keep our life simple?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were we ready to trade
our time together as a family

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more money?

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:44.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Victor how much
I appreciated the opportunity

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:48.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but felt that it just wasn’t
the right fit for our family.

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:52.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Money was tight, but we were OK.

00:08:52.677 --> 00:08:54.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had what we needed.

00:08:58.392 --> 00:08:59.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying no to that promotion

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:03.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant holding off on a few upgrades,

00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:14.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also meant more time
for meeting preparation, . . .

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:15.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Miller.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go on and look at the—

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:23.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>. . . </i> more time for the ministry,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more time

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each other.

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the happiness
of our brother and his family

00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:44.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he decided to live a simple life?

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:47.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why does a simple life
bring us happiness?

00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:51.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 5:12 highlights one reason.

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:55.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that together
—Ecclesiastes 5:12.

00:09:55.615 --> 00:09:59.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does a simple life bring us happiness?

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:01.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse says:

00:10:01.288 --> 00:10:03.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sweet is the sleep of the one serving,

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether he eats little or much,

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:08.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the plenty belonging to the rich one

00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:11.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not permit him to sleep.”

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:16.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those who possess much
may be anxious about losing their possessions

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:20.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus lose sleep worrying about them.

00:10:20.098 --> 00:10:24.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, those with little materially
have less to worry about,

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:28.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can enjoy,
as the verse says, “sweet . . . sleep.”

00:10:28.565 --> 00:10:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we refuse to allow material things
to interfere with our sacred service,

00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:39.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we gain satisfaction, peace, and joy.

00:10:39.618 --> 00:10:41.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’re presented with an offer

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:44.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the one given
to our brother in the video,

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:46.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should you do?

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:48.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for help to make a decision
that will be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:57.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, ask yourself:
Will this decision complicate my life?

00:10:57.886 --> 00:11:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how will this affect
the time I spend serving Jehovah?

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:04.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions like those
helped our brother in the video

00:11:04.768 --> 00:11:07.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a decision that brought great joy.

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:13.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, any decision you make
that promotes a simple life

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:17.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focused on serving Jehovah
will lead to joy that “is well-founded,

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:21.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with roots reaching deep in God’s Word.”

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:24.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us attain the true joy

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:26.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from living a simple life.

00:11:28.416 --> 00:11:31.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a simple life
is not the only thing that leads to joy.

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

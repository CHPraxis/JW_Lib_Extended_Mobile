Thanks to modern technology,

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people the world over say

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have more “friends” than ever.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they have to do
is add a person’s name

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their list of “friends”
on a social network.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some boast of having hundreds,

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:20.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even thousands, of such “friends.”

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:23.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others don’t have access to the Internet,

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they make friends
the old-fashioned way

00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:30.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at work, at school,
or in the neighborhood.

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having good friends is very important.

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to ask ourselves:

00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is true friendship?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where should I look for true friends?

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:47.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can my choice of friends affect my joy?

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:51.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:55.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about the effect
our brother’s choice of friends

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has on his joy.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, believe me,

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:07.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s not the only dirt I have on Victor.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, we’re listening.

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:13.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last week,
he’s talking in his office, right?

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:16.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has no idea
that I’m standing right there,

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:18.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s bragging
to his buddy . . .

00:01:18.353 --> 00:01:21.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t want to hear this.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:23.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lunch with them seemed harmless,

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:27.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this was anything but upbuilding.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, hey, check out these guys.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the Bible people.

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-oh.

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:39.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t look now!

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think they have someone.

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might try to convert us too!

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the deal with these people?

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:52.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it’s cool

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:54.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you want to believe
in fairy tales and everything,

00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but keep it to yourself,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right?

00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:58.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!
Exactly!

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:00.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, . . .

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:02.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those carts are everywhere now!

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:05.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re all over the city.

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:11.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t finish my lunch.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never noticed
how sarcastic and negative

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:18.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my coworkers could be.

00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had always thought of them as,

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, as friends.

00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:40.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what kind of friends was I making?

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:49.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the brother’s face
at the end of the video?

00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t look very happy.

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:53.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:55.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The association seemed harmless.

00:02:55.998 --> 00:02:59.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Workmates were just taking
their lunch break together,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their conversation
went in a negative direction.

00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:07.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They began talking
about finding dirt on a fellow worker.

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it got personal.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His coworkers started to make fun

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:15.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Witnesses
who were preaching using a cart.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:19.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Proverbs chapter 19.

00:03:19.857 --> 00:03:22.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read three verses here,

00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:27.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these verses reveal
the disappointing reality

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of looking to the world

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a source of true friends.

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:35.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Proverbs chapter 19,
we’ll start with verse 4,

00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:38.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then read verses 6 and 7:

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wealth attracts many friends,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the poor man
will be deserted even by his friend.

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:48.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many seek the favor of a noble,

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:52.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and everyone is a friend
to the man who gives gifts.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the brothers of a poor man hate him;

00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how much more he is shunned by his friends!

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:03.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He pursues them with requests,
but no one responds.”

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:06.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships in the world

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are often based on selfish motives.

00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:12.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As verse 4 says:

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:14.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wealth attracts friends;

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
poverty drives them away.’

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:20.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such friendships can be shallow,

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:23.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can end abruptly.

00:04:23.257 --> 00:04:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One 42-year-old woman

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:29.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had over a thousand “friends”
on her social network.

00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:31.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, not one of those “friends”

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:34.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responded to her plea for help

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:37.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before she took her own life.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships with the world
are not only disappointing

00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they can also damage
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:44.947 --> 00:04:46.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With good reason,

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the footnote to 1 Corinthians 15:33 warns us:

00:04:51.954 --> 00:04:56.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bad associations corrupt good morals.”

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cultivating friendships with people

00:05:00.088 --> 00:05:04.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who do not serve Jehovah
is like trying to mix oil with water.

00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:07.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just doesn’t work.

00:05:07.178 --> 00:05:09.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Scriptures
teach that true friends

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:16.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be found only among Jehovah’s people.

00:05:18.107 --> 00:05:21.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Christian brotherhood is the only place

00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:24.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we can find friends
like the one described

00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:27.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 18:24.

00:05:27.492 --> 00:05:29.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to that scripture,

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the distinction
between a companion

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a true friend.

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:39.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 18:24 reads:

00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:43.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are companions
ready to crush one another,

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:47.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there is a friend
who sticks closer than a brother.”

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Christian brothers and sisters

00:05:51.308 --> 00:05:55.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not simply companions, or acquaintances,

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone we happen to know;

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are loyal friends.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can rely on them.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it because we’re all the same age?

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it because we come from the same national,

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
economic, or social background?

00:06:10.913 --> 00:06:12.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:15.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our friends in the Christian congregation

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stick “closer than a brother”

00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:21.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they share our faith, our values,

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:25.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our love for Jehovah, and our hopes.

00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They work with us
side by side in the ministry.

00:06:29.098 --> 00:06:31.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support us when we’re discouraged

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:33.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when we’re facing a trial.

00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:36.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They rejoice with us when we have good times

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:39.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together in Jehovah’s service.

00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:44.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the true friendships that we enjoy now
in the Christian congregation

00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:47.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to last forever.

00:06:47.576 --> 00:06:51.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the brother
having lunch with his workmates?

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watch his face closely

00:06:56.377 --> 00:07:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice how having
true friends affected his joy.

00:07:11.268 --> 00:07:12.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so glad

00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had taken a day off from work.

00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long had it been since Lisa and I

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:19.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got to spend a whole day together
in midweek service?

00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:32.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lisa started a Bible study.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we got to share our day
with good friends

00:07:39.423 --> 00:07:41.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people like Sam and Chloe.

00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:43.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve really been there for us

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the ups and downs.

00:07:56.107 --> 00:07:57.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at that!

00:07:57.525 --> 00:07:58.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that you?

00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:01.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing over there?

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:06.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you guys know about this?

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know where we’d be

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:20.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if Jehovah hadn’t helped us
to keep our priorities straight

00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:24.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—keeping our life simple,

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a clean conscience,

00:08:32.938 --> 00:08:34.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
staying focused on work

00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:36.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has real meaning,

00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having real friends.

00:08:45.326 --> 00:08:47.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What more can you ask for?

00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:53.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that the way we feel
after we spend time

00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:56.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our true friends in the congregation?

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:59.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it about our brothers and sisters

00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:03.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes those friendships
so special, so precious?

00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:07.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do those friendships
bring us so much joy?

00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:12.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our friendship
is based on a solid foundation.

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:16.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when we meet
a fellow Witness for the first time,

00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:18.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we already know a lot about each other.

00:09:18.694 --> 00:09:21.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about all the things
we share in common:

00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worship the only true God, Jehovah;

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we speak the same pure language of truth;

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:32.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we adhere to Jehovah’s high moral standards;

00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:37.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have the same hope for the future.

00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:40.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These things are the foundation

00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:44.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a relationship
built on confidence and trust

00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:47.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a true friendship.

00:09:47.892 --> 00:09:52.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a contrast to people
who do not know Jehovah!

00:09:52.147 --> 00:09:55.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether their friendships are formed online,

00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at work, at school, or in the neighborhood,

00:09:58.653 --> 00:10:03.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friendships in the world
are often based on shared interest.

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:07.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, true friendships

00:10:07.037 --> 00:10:10.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are based on common values.

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Proverbs 17:17,

00:10:15.505 --> 00:10:19.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the kind
of friendships we will enjoy

00:10:19.384 --> 00:10:23.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they are based on spiritual values.

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:26.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 17:17:

00:10:26.933 --> 00:10:31.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A true friend shows love at all times

00:10:31.104 --> 00:10:36.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is a brother
who is born for times of distress.”

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True friends support one another

00:10:38.988 --> 00:10:43.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our true friendships

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a valuable contribution to our joy.

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:53.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People everywhere want to be happy,

00:10:53.712 --> 00:10:56.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many fail to find true joy

00:10:56.673 --> 00:11:00.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’re looking in the wrong place.

00:11:00.052 --> 00:11:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed in this symposium,

00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:05.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world claims that we can be happy

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:10.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we pursue wealth,
if we engage in sinful conduct,

00:11:10.187 --> 00:11:13.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we adopt extreme views of work,

00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:18.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we cultivate friendships
anywhere we can find them.

00:11:18.154 --> 00:11:22.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such assertions originate
with the ruler of the world,

00:11:22.409 --> 00:11:25.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the father of the lie, Satan the Devil.

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:29.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look for happiness in Satan’s world,

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:32.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to be disappointed.

00:11:32.378 --> 00:11:36.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, this first symposium

00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:38.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our “Always Rejoice”! Convention

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:40.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has identified four factors

00:11:40.803 --> 00:11:43.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that contribute to our lasting joy.

00:11:43.848 --> 00:11:45.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word teaches us

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that joy comes from first,
living a simple life;

00:11:50.438 --> 00:11:53.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, having a clean conscience;

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:56.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
third, doing meaningful work;

00:11:56.445 --> 00:12:00.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fourth, having true friendships.

00:12:00.532 --> 00:12:03.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loving Father, Jehovah,

00:12:03.035 --> 00:12:06.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knows what makes us truly happy.

00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:09.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we
continue to follow his sound advice.

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:12.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, we will find

00:12:12.587 --> 00:12:16.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
abundant joy that lasts forever.

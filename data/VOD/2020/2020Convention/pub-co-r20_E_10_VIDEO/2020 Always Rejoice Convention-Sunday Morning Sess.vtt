00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:04.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take your seats.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We extend a warm welcome to all

00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who accepted an invitation
to join us for this convention.

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many have been
persuaded that happiness

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be found by pursuing material wealth.

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do such riches bring true joy?

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, what does?

00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:28.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take note of the Bible-based answers

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and real-life experiences
presented in the following discourse

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:36.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Enjoy Riches Without Pain—How?”

00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:38.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This talk will be given

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:41.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body.

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Jackson, you have our attention.

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:54.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to be rich?

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:58.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most persons would immediately answer,
“Of course I do,”

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:03.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they think being rich
means that they will enjoy life

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have happiness and contentment.

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:08.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s ask a second question:

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:13.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you willing
to do to become rich?

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a lot harder
to answer, isn’t it?

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:20.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you think about the importance
of that question,

00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:24.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read a very important warning
that the Bible gives us.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to take your Bibles,
please, and we’ll turn together

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the first book of Timothy

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Timothy 6:9, 10.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:42.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the warning:
“But those who are determined to be rich

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“fall into temptation and a snare

00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:48.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and many senseless
and harmful desires

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that plunge men
into destruction and ruin.

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:56.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the love of money is the root
of all sorts of injurious things,

00:01:56.723 --> 00:02:01.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and by reaching out for this love
some have been led astray from the faith

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:06.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have stabbed themselves
all over with many pains.”

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:11.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that certainly is
a very important warning, isn’t it?

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:15.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look at it, we see
that although the Bible acknowledges

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:19.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that money is useful,
it highlights here

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the love of money”
or, in other words,

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:24.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those who are determined to be rich.”

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:27.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice at the end,
there at verse 10,

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:29.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that this can lead to persons

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:33.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being “stabbed . . . all over
with many pains.”

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:36.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, they have gain,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they also have pain along with it.

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s something else

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:47.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can cause problems
for those who have a love for money.

00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:49.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may sacrifice their health.

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:54.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may sacrifice their family life
and even their standards.

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible highlights yet something else
that they need to be careful about.

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:03.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time, if we turn our Bibles
to the book of Proverbs,

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:08.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please turn with me to Proverbs 28:20.

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:13.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Proverbs 28:20:

00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:18.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A faithful man will receive many blessings,

00:03:18.306 --> 00:03:20.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the one hastening to get rich

00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or, in other words, in a hurry
he quickly wants to get rich

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—what does it say?—
well, that person]

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not remain innocent.”

00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:33.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t that true—that many people

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
steal, lie, cheat?

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:39.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even prostitute themselves,

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:44.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others kill other persons
just to get rich.

00:03:44.207 --> 00:03:48.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, truly,
these are important questions

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each one of us to think about.

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why does the Bible
highlight so strongly

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this warning
about trying to get rich?

00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:02.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one of the reasons
is that the Bible highlights

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the deceptive power of riches.”

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:08.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you might be wondering,
‘What does that mean

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:11.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“the deceptive power of riches”?’

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:14.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe we
could illustrate it this way:

00:04:14.447 --> 00:04:18.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine you wake up
in the middle of a dark night.

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wind is blowing strongly.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rain is falling heavily,
and you start to worry about flooding.

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:27.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you see that there is no electricity.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:32.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you start to grope around,
and you find a flashlight.

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:35.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of a sudden,
you feel like you have some help

00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:37.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you can see what’s happening.

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:41.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you try to turn it on,
there’s no light.

00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:46.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then you remember,
‘Ah, I just bought some batteries.’

00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:51.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you grope up around in the drawer,
you find, ‘Here, I’ve got a battery.’

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:54.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you put them in with the hope

00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:56.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this will now give you light,

00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:59.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the batteries are dead.

00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:02.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps there’s a problem with them.

00:05:02.162 --> 00:05:05.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is “the deceptive power.”

00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:10.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You put your reliance on something,
and it doesn’t help you.

00:05:10.712 --> 00:05:12.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:05:12.714 --> 00:05:15.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
money can have that same type
of deceptive power.

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:17.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may look at it.

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:20.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may think, ‘Yes, this will help me.’

00:05:20.347 --> 00:05:23.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happens in times of trouble?

00:05:24.518 --> 00:05:28.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Bible helps us to see
that money doesn’t always give us

00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:31.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that we need
in times of problems.

00:05:31.817 --> 00:05:35.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just think
about three different areas of life.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,
money doesn’t automatically mean

00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:42.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have genuine security.

00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:44.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree.

00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more money we have,
perhaps the more security that we need

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:48.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have to protect it.

00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:53.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we think about this,
the Bible clearly highlights the problem.

00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:58.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time, if you’d like to turn
with me to the book of Proverbs,

00:05:58.094 --> 00:06:01.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to read
Proverbs chapter 18.

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn there

00:06:03.725 --> 00:06:07.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Proverbs 18:11,

00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:12.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice this very interesting word picture
that the Bible uses here:

00:06:12.442 --> 00:06:17.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wealth of the rich
is his fortified city;

00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:22.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is like a protective wall
in his imagination.”

00:06:23.537 --> 00:06:26.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is
very thought-provoking, isn’t it?

00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:29.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we
could illustrate it this way:

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:33.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person might pay
a lot of money every month

00:06:33.338 --> 00:06:38.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a security firm to care
for his home and his family.

00:06:38.343 --> 00:06:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each night
he may sleep very soundly.

00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:46.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if he found out later
that this was a fake company?

00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:48.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were no security guards.

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was just paying money for nothing.

00:06:50.814 --> 00:06:54.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That security would be only security

00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in his imagination,” wouldn’t it?

00:06:56.821 --> 00:07:00.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also highlights
another aspect of this,

00:07:00.032 --> 00:07:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you’ll agree
with these comments.

00:07:02.618 --> 00:07:06.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 23 of the same book
(the book of Proverbs),

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:11.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 23:4, 5

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:15.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starts with this very good warning:

00:07:15.673 --> 00:07:19.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:23.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop and show understanding.

00:07:23.723 --> 00:07:26.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now notice the word picture.]

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:30.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you cast your eyes on it
[that is, on wealth or money],

00:07:30.814 --> 00:07:35.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is not there,
for it will surely sprout wings

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:38.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like an eagle
and fly off into the sky.”

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’m sure you’ve experienced that,
haven’t you?

00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:43.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your paycheck comes.

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:45.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think, ‘Yes, I’ve got some money.’

00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:48.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You turn your back,
and all of a sudden, it’s gone.

00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:50.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s not enough money.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in a bigger sense,
in recent times, we’ve seen how money

00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:59.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be devalued
and how even precious commodities,

00:07:59.593 --> 00:08:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as oil and gold,
can lose their value.

00:08:03.263 --> 00:08:08.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me: A number of years ago,
someone gave me this banknote.

00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:11.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking at it and reading it, it says:

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I promise to pay the bearer on demand

00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:18.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
20 billion dollars.”

00:08:18.904 --> 00:08:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:08:20.948 --> 00:08:24.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On outward appearances,
it looks like I’m quite wealthy.

00:08:24.368 --> 00:08:28.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve probably guessed
that if I were to present this

00:08:28.247 --> 00:08:31.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and demand payment,
I really wouldn’t get much from it

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:35.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this money
has been devalued.

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:37.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a similar way,

00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:40.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like the batteries that don’t work,

00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:42.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
money at times

00:08:42.762 --> 00:08:46.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not give us the security that we want.

00:08:46.307 --> 00:08:48.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a second area

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:52.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which money can’t automatically give
us what we want

00:08:52.105 --> 00:08:56.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is with regard
to happiness and contentment.

00:08:56.276 --> 00:09:01.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, money doesn’t automatically bring
happiness and contentment.

00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:06.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve probably seen accounts of persons
who appear to be very successful.

00:09:06.286 --> 00:09:08.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re famous.
They have money.

00:09:08.497 --> 00:09:13.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet when they’re interviewed,
they talk about how lonely they feel

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:16.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how meaningless
their lives are.

00:09:16.129 --> 00:09:19.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly what
the Bible tells us.

00:09:19.675 --> 00:09:24.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions that someone
who accumulates a lot of money

00:09:24.221 --> 00:09:28.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is never really satisfied
with what they’ve already got.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want more.

00:09:29.977 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:34.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve heard accounts of persons,
one way or another,

00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:38.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have accumulated billions of dollars,

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:40.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they just keep on accumulating money,

00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they couldn’t use all that money

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 10 or 20 lifetimes.

00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:51.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also tells us
that oftentimes a rich person

00:09:51.582 --> 00:09:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stays awake at night
worrying about his money.

00:09:55.878 --> 00:09:58.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, there’s another area

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:02.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is even more important
than those first two areas of life.

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:05.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is that money

00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:10.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot automatically bring God’s blessings.

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an interesting thought.

00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:14.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that?

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look to the words
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are recorded for us
in the book of Matthew.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:26.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn with me
to Matthew chapter 6,

00:10:26.034 --> 00:10:29.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 24.

00:10:29.621 --> 00:10:33.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words of Jesus
were part of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:10:35.293 --> 00:10:37.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jesus says,

00:10:37.796 --> 00:10:41.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 6:24:

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one can slave for two masters;

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for either he will hate the one

00:10:46.805 --> 00:10:48.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and love the other,

00:10:48.807 --> 00:10:53.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or he will stick to the one
and despise the other.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cannot slave
for God and for Riches.”

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:01.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that says it very clearly,
doesn’t it?

00:11:01.737 --> 00:11:04.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
we have to make a choice.

00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:09.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t serve God
and Riches at the same time.

00:11:09.078 --> 00:11:13.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this would affect our service
and our love of God.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:17.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So looking at those
three areas of life,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that money
can be like that dead battery.

00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:24.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t necessarily give
us genuine security,

00:11:24.677 --> 00:11:28.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t necessarily give us
happiness and contentment,

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:33.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can interfere
with our relationship with God.

00:11:33.186 --> 00:11:37.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at a video,
and we’re going to see in this video

00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:40.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how two individuals are affected

00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:43.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by this love
for material things or for money.

00:11:50.954 --> 00:11:53.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought happiness was all about money

00:11:53.832 --> 00:11:56.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting to buy whatever I wanted.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really into fashion.

00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:08.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was always thinking
about what I was going to get next,

00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:11.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t mind
putting in extra overtime to get it.

00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:20.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My day ended with me
taking the last train home, eating,

00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then going to bed
at one or two o’clock in the morning.

00:12:25.072 --> 00:12:28.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this affected me
mentally and physically.

00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:32.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d wake up in the middle
of the night with panic attacks.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so lost and confused.

00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:40.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I’d worked for
was for nothing.

00:12:45.802 --> 00:12:47.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My motto for shopping was,

00:12:47.804 --> 00:12:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When in doubt, buy!”

00:12:52.475 --> 00:12:56.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bought a lot of things:
powerful motorcycles, a house, cars.

00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:03.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was totally absorbed in work
and sometimes worked all night.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I somehow made it to meetings,

00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:11.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but after they ended,
I’d leave right away.

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t show interest in anyone,
not even my wife.

00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:18.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I ever talked about was work,

00:13:18.752 --> 00:13:22.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I showed a real lack
of consideration for my wife.

00:13:22.047 --> 00:13:24.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really blunt with her,

00:13:24.132 --> 00:13:27.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there was a constant
back and forth between us.

00:13:28.887 --> 00:13:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had a strained relationship.

00:13:31.807 --> 00:13:33.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t happy.

00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just felt stress,
stress, and more stress.

00:13:37.187 --> 00:13:39.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything seemed pointless.

00:13:47.281 --> 00:13:49.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we see in that video?

00:13:49.742 --> 00:13:52.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice that both those individuals

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really enjoyed going after money.

00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:58.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to be rich.

00:13:58.251 --> 00:14:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did they receive
happiness and contentment?

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:05.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were problems
that came along with it.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gained some things
but with pain.

00:14:10.263 --> 00:14:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So considering all these factors
we’ve just discussed,

00:14:14.684 --> 00:14:19.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it mean that it’s wrong
for us to want to be rich?

00:14:19.063 --> 00:14:21.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:14:21.107 --> 00:14:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that may sound like a contradiction,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let’s have a look at another scripture
in the book of Proverbs.

00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:31.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time we’ll turn
to Proverbs chapter 10.

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:34.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 10 verse 22,

00:14:34.663 --> 00:14:39.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice it talks about
a different sort of riches.

00:14:39.209 --> 00:14:41.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:44.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read it in Proverbs 10:22:

00:14:44.923 --> 00:14:49.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
that makes one rich,

00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He adds no pain with it.”

00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:56.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what is it

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really brings us true riches?

00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s “the blessing of Jehovah.”

00:15:02.191 --> 00:15:06.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the blessings
that we gain from God

00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:11.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are true riches because (notice what it says
at the end of that verse)

00:15:11.158 --> 00:15:14.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he adds no pain with it.”

00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:17.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s gain without pain.

00:15:18.457 --> 00:15:21.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we think about this,
we might ask,

00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:25.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could we ever accumulate
these types of riches?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our Lord Jesus Christ
answered this in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:15:29.802 --> 00:15:33.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you turn back with me
to the chapter that we already referred to,

00:15:33.598 --> 00:15:37.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 6, you’ll notice here

00:15:37.393 --> 00:15:41.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus describes to us
how we can obtain

00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:44.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these genuine riches

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:48.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:19-21:

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:52.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop storing up for yourselves
treasures on the earth,

00:15:52.742 --> 00:15:57.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where moth and rust consume
and where thieves break in and steal.

00:15:57.747 --> 00:16:02.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, store up for yourselves
treasures in heaven,

00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:05.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where neither moth
nor rust consumes,

00:16:05.672 --> 00:16:08.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and where thieves
do not break in and steal.

00:16:08.508 --> 00:16:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For where your treasure is,
there your heart will be also.”

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:17.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see what Jesus
is telling us here?

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not just to strive after getting
material riches here on the earth,

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:27.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice that he says that we
should “store up . . . treasures in heaven.”

00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:31.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is not talking
about an offshore bank account.

00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it’s talking in a symbolic way

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:37.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how we can build up, as it were,

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:40.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good relationship with God

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of the things that we do.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:47.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, these are true treasures.

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:50.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, when we think
about the life of Jesus Christ,

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he <i>lived </i> by these things
that he preached.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:58.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t try to accumulate
all these material things in his life.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:03.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he focused on serving
his heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:07.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t distracted by greed

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:11.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by some desire
for personal fame and glory.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:16.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he focused on building up
these “treasures in heaven.”

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might remember
that even at one time in His life,

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil tried to tempt Him.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember that one
of those temptations involved this very fact

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:31.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that Jesus resisted the desire
to accumulate material things?

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn our Bibles this time
to the book of Matthew,

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll look at one of the temptations,
as recorded here by Matthew.

00:17:40.102 --> 00:17:45.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Matthew 4:8-10,

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here we’re told:

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Again the Devil took him along
to an unusually high mountain

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and showed him all the kingdoms
of the world and their glory.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he said to him:
‘All these things I will give you

00:18:01.874 --> 00:18:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if you fall down
and do an act of worship to me.’

00:18:05.962 --> 00:18:09.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus said to him:
‘Go away, Satan!

00:18:09.966 --> 00:18:14.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For it is written:
“It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”’”

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus clearly rejected this temptation

00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:26.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept from Satan

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:29.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these riches and glories of the world.

00:18:29.486 --> 00:18:33.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His focus was on serving Jehovah.

00:18:33.156 --> 00:18:35.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the wise thing to do.

00:18:35.784 --> 00:18:37.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you stop and think about it,

00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:41.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, if riches
and the glory of the world

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the very things
that make us happy,

00:18:44.459 --> 00:18:47.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why was Satan
willing to give all that away?

00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:51.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, it hadn’t given him happiness.

00:18:51.008 --> 00:18:53.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted something else, didn’t he?

00:18:53.176 --> 00:18:56.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus selected the right thing

00:18:56.096 --> 00:18:59.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to build up “treasures in heaven.”

00:18:59.558 --> 00:19:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we worship Jehovah and obey him,

00:19:03.604 --> 00:19:07.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can expect to get our lives enriched

00:19:07.024 --> 00:19:11.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by these wonderful things
that Jehovah gives us.

00:19:11.195 --> 00:19:14.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of the symbolic riches,
we could say,

00:19:14.156 --> 00:19:16.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can gain even now?

00:19:16.534 --> 00:19:19.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s think
about five different things.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is in a well-known scripture
in the book of Psalms.

00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn with me to Psalm 83,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 83.

00:19:30.214 --> 00:19:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to read verse 18:

00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:36.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May people know that you,

00:19:36.888 --> 00:19:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whose name is Jehovah, you alone

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the Most High over all the earth.”

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the first

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:49.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these things that can enrich our lives?

00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:52.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s knowing God.

00:19:52.153 --> 00:19:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, many people
like to know the rich and famous,

00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:59.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just think of it, we have
the privilege of coming to know

00:19:59.995 --> 00:20:02.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Sovereign of the universe.

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:06.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, by learning about him
and getting to know him,

00:20:06.501 --> 00:20:09.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our lives truly become rich.

00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:12.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in addition to that,

00:20:12.007 --> 00:20:14.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become worshippers of Jehovah.

00:20:14.718 --> 00:20:18.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that includes us
in a worldwide brotherhood

00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a brotherhood that comes
from all sorts of nations

00:20:23.185 --> 00:20:25.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and racial backgrounds and languages.

00:20:25.354 --> 00:20:28.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, this global brotherhood

00:20:28.774 --> 00:20:33.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is united in love
—the love of serving Jehovah God.

00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:37.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s something
that enriches our lives as well.

00:20:37.366 --> 00:20:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third point is that even though
we’re living in difficult times,

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:46.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we follow the advice
and direction given to us by Jehovah

00:20:46.626 --> 00:20:51.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his Word, the Bible, then we
can attain a measure of happiness right now.

00:20:51.631 --> 00:20:55.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the Bible
gives us advice

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:58.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to be good fathers
and mothers and children.

00:20:58.971 --> 00:21:03.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can add to happiness,
love, and unity in the family.

00:21:03.977 --> 00:21:06.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else that’s important

00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enriches our lives:
We have hope.

00:21:10.733 --> 00:21:12.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope for the future.

00:21:12.944 --> 00:21:17.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we’re living in a world
that’s dominated by wicked people,

00:21:17.282 --> 00:21:21.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us about what’s going
to happen in the future.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
back to the book of Psalms.

00:21:24.664 --> 00:21:26.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time we’re going to read

00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:22.

00:21:30.754 --> 00:21:33.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the promise that’s given here:

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those blessed by Him
[that is Jehovah]

00:21:39.513 --> 00:21:41.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will possess the earth,

00:21:41.807 --> 00:21:46.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those cursed by Him
will be done away with.”

00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Bible promises us that in the future

00:21:50.065 --> 00:21:52.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’ll be a big change here on earth.

00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only those who love God
“will possess the earth.”

00:21:57.531 --> 00:21:59.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful hope!

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fifth point
is the wonderful promise

00:22:03.871 --> 00:22:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible gives us that those
whom we love who have already died

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have the opportunity
of being resurrected

00:22:11.545 --> 00:22:14.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, in other words,
being brought back to life.

00:22:14.173 --> 00:22:16.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the promise of Jesus.

00:22:16.551 --> 00:22:20.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s recorded in John chapter 5.

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:22.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please turn with me

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to John 5:28, 29.

00:22:28.938 --> 00:22:33.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jesus’ promise:
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the hour is coming in which
all those in the memorial tombs

00:22:38.073 --> 00:22:43.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will hear his voice and come out,
those who did good things

00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:47.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to a resurrection of life,
and those who practice vile things

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:54.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What beautiful hopes these are

00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:59.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a hope for a change in the world
and a hope for those who have died

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:02.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come back
and live again in a paradise!

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the things
that can enrich our lives right now.

00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:12.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s think back
to those two individuals in the video.

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:14.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could they change their lives

00:23:14.902 --> 00:23:19.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that instead of trying to pursue
after material riches,

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:21.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could achieve these true riches?

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch and see.

00:23:30.543 --> 00:23:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I hadn’t been caring

00:23:32.962 --> 00:23:35.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for myself on the inside,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided
to read the Bible all over again.

00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:42.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was especially moved

00:23:42.764 --> 00:23:46.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by how Jehovah repeatedly tried 
to help the Israelites

00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite all their failures.

00:23:49.312 --> 00:23:52.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminded me
that Jehovah had been expressing

00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:55.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his love for me all along.

00:23:58.196 --> 00:24:01.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t hold back my tears.

00:24:01.324 --> 00:24:06.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided that I’d live
the rest of my life for him.

00:24:09.749 --> 00:24:14.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I adjusted my work and made
the ministry the focal point in my life.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I get to share a Bible scripture

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:20.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone and see it
make an impact on them,

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel truly happy.

00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:33.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw some brothers
from the congregation

00:24:33.065 --> 00:24:36.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
playing soccer with a young boy
who had just lost his father.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were trying to comfort him
by spending time with him.

00:24:43.993 --> 00:24:46.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw them
showing personal interest in someone

00:24:46.745 --> 00:24:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and considering others’ feelings,

00:24:48.998 --> 00:24:52.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really impressed me and I thought,

00:24:52.001 --> 00:24:55.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want to use my time like that as well.’

00:24:55.212 --> 00:24:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture in the Bible says:

00:24:58.174 --> 00:25:01.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:25:01.636 --> 00:25:04.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I practiced it,
the happier I became.

00:25:04.138 --> 00:25:07.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became convinced
that this really is the truth.

00:25:08.935 --> 00:25:11.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when my wife and I
spend time together,

00:25:11.688 --> 00:25:14.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m better able to really understand her,

00:25:14.941 --> 00:25:17.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve come to realize
how much she means to me.

00:25:17.777 --> 00:25:21.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so thankful that Jehovah
has taught me the truth.

00:25:28.538 --> 00:25:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did these two individuals
gain true riches?

00:25:33.543 --> 00:25:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By focusing on serving Jehovah God,

00:25:36.922 --> 00:25:40.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling others the good news
about what’s in the Bible,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by sharing
good things with others.

00:25:43.762 --> 00:25:47.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we’ve started in a life course

00:25:47.474 --> 00:25:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that involves just looking
for material riches,

00:25:50.894 --> 00:25:54.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too can change
and follow their example.

00:25:54.773 --> 00:25:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the future?

00:25:57.401 --> 00:26:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What true riches
are ahead of us in the future

00:26:00.904 --> 00:26:05.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continue to have
a good relationship with Jehovah God?

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:07.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to turn your attention

00:26:07.578 --> 00:26:11.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a beautiful prophecy
in the book of Revelation.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take your Bibles,
and turn to this book, Revelation.

00:26:16.045 --> 00:26:18.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to look at chapter 21

00:26:18.881 --> 00:26:21.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 3 through 5.

00:26:21.884 --> 00:26:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read these words,
imagine, if you would, please,

00:26:26.722 --> 00:26:30.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a beautiful place
the world will be

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:33.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah God
makes it into a paradise!

00:26:33.813 --> 00:26:37.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Revelation 21:3-5:

00:26:39.068 --> 00:26:42.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice
from the throne say: ‘Look!

00:26:42.947 --> 00:26:47.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The tent of God is with mankind,
and he will reside with them,

00:26:47.202 --> 00:26:49.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will be his people.

00:26:49.496 --> 00:26:52.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And God himself will be with them.

00:26:52.249 --> 00:26:55.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And he will wipe out
every tear from their eyes,

00:26:55.961 --> 00:27:00.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and death will be no more,
neither will mourning nor outcry

00:27:00.132 --> 00:27:02.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘nor pain be anymore.

00:27:02.384 --> 00:27:05.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The former things have passed away.’

00:27:05.512 --> 00:27:08.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the One seated
on the throne said: ‘Look!

00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:11.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m making all things new.’

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:13.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also he says: ‘Write,

00:27:13.604 --> 00:27:17.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these words are faithful and true.’”

00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:20.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful promise this is!

00:27:20.361 --> 00:27:23.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, in the future

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this earth will be turned into a paradise.

00:27:25.699 --> 00:27:30.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice it says ‘no more tears
and no more mourning or outcry.’

00:27:30.663 --> 00:27:34.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also notice that it says
“no more . . . pain.”

00:27:34.959 --> 00:27:39.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the blessings
that come from Jehovah God.

00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will people feel
at that particular time?

00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:47.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn our Bibles to our final scripture
in the book of Isaiah

00:27:47.847 --> 00:27:51.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 65.

00:27:51.017 --> 00:27:54.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to start reading at verse 17.

00:27:55.897 --> 00:28:00.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning of verse 17, it mentions
about the “new heavens” and “new earth”

00:28:00.902 --> 00:28:04.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is planning to bring about.

00:28:04.155 --> 00:28:08.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice the last part of verse 17:

00:28:08.076 --> 00:28:12.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the former things
will not be called to mind,

00:28:12.914 --> 00:28:15.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will they come up into the heart.”

00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:18.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful blessing that is!

00:28:18.253 --> 00:28:20.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something that money can’t buy.

00:28:20.547 --> 00:28:25.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, no matter what
traumatic experiences we’ve had in this life

00:28:25.552 --> 00:28:28.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter what pain
we’ve experienced—

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:33.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those things will be healed,
no more pain at all.

00:28:33.435 --> 00:28:38.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful promise
from our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah!

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, if we look down
to verses 21 through 23,

00:28:42.653 --> 00:28:46.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the activities
that people will be engaged in:

00:28:46.365 --> 00:28:49.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will build houses
and live in them,

00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:55.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:28:55.583 --> 00:28:58.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor will they plant
for others to eat.

00:28:58.294 --> 00:29:02.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:29:02.882 --> 00:29:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:29:08.638 --> 00:29:13.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not toil for nothing,
nor will they bear children for distress,

00:29:13.643 --> 00:29:18.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are the offspring
made up of those blessed by Jehovah,

00:29:18.648 --> 00:29:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their descendants with them.”

00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:25.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful time that will be!

00:29:25.947 --> 00:29:30.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can be part
of the riches that you can attain.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, what should be
the determination of each one of us?

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:38.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to strive
after fake riches

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:42.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—riches that just give
us gain with pain.

00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, let us strengthen our relationship
with our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:29:46.843 --> 00:29:51.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this way, we truly will
reach out for the real riches

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those that we gain without pain!

00:29:57.479 --> 00:30:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and its Author, Jehovah God.

00:30:41.608 --> 00:30:46.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging session
of Bible-based instruction this has been!

We look forward to the thrilling finale
in the next session.

00:30:49.824 --> 00:30:54.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we invite you to stand, if possible,

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and join in singing song number 84,

00:30:57.958 --> 00:31:01.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Reaching Out.”

00:31:01.419 --> 00:31:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This song reminds us of the joy
that comes from helping others

00:31:05.215 --> 00:31:07.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw close to God.

00:31:07.592 --> 00:31:11.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 84.

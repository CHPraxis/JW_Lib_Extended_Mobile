This symposium has helped us
to appreciate even more 

00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love
for families.

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate this gift,
the Bible,

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:15.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which serves
as a blueprint for families

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:19.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a loving,
warm, safe environment.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:23.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You young ones
play a vital role

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in contributing
to the joy in your family life.

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:31.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mother and your father
love you very much,

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want to have a close,
personal, loving relationship with you.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s
their heartfelt desire

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:42.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have a close,
personal, loving relationship

00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:45.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want you
to be happy now

00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:51.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the rest of your life
—everlasting life.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the previous talk,
we understood how Jehovah wants

00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:59.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
parents to train
their children.

00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:01.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with what purpose?

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:05.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Proverbs 22:6

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:09.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives as instructions
for parents.

00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:11.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in verse 6, it reads:

00:01:11.887 --> 00:01:16.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Train a boy 
[or the footnote says, “child; youth”]

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:20.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the way he should go;
even when he grows old

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will not depart from it.”

00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Jehovah
asking of your parents?

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:31.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To train you
—to train you in such a way

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:34.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will always serve
Jehovah from your youth

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:37.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the way
to your adulthood

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, really,
for the rest of your life.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah doesn’t spell out
every single detail

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for parents on how they should instruct
you and how they should train you.

00:01:48.384 --> 00:01:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s left up to them.

00:01:50.386 --> 00:01:55.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they need to prayerfully think
about what would be best for your family

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for you
as a child personally.

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that they
will make house rules.

00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:05.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you’ll get chores,
maybe curfews.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will get reminders,
correction, and discipline.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:14.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they love you
and because they’re doing their best

00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:17.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen and obey Jehovah,

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:19.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his instructions
are to train you

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:23.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discipline you so that you
can serve Jehovah forever.

00:02:23.963 --> 00:02:26.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not an easy assignment.

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:30.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need all the help
that they can get from Jehovah

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as from you,
especially when they make rules

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you may not like:
what you can and cannot wear,

00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:40.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you can
and cannot listen to or watch,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or who you pick
as close friends.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are decisions
that are left to your parents.

00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:51.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, will your parents always make
the perfect decision, the perfect rule?

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:55.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Breaking news:

00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:59.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not news to you
that they will make mistakes.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re imperfect,
but they love you,

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:04.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re doing the best
they can to give you

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best training possible

00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:10.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can love Jehovah
and serve him forever.

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you
love and appreciate

00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:17.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that your parents do for you,
but let’s be real.

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:21.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you don’t understand
the reason for the rule

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:24.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you simply don’t agree with it.

00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:27.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do?
Well, you get frustrated.

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s OK.
We’ve been there.

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were your age
at one time,

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:35.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we completely understand
that it could be frustrating.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know
that this will pass

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:41.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’ll understand
why they’re doing this.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:43.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s out of love.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:46.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you
don’t see eye to eye,

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what are you supposed to do?

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes you need
to change your view.

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:56.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much has to do with how
you view your parents.

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:59.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How you view
your mother and your father

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:02.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will affect how much
or how little

00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:07.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you respect them,
listen to them, and obey them.

00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:11.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s a question
we’d like to pose to you children:

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:14.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you sometimes
view your parents

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:18.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as prison guards
or lifeguards?

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting question.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:25.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prison guards are trained
to keep a close watch over prisoners

00:04:25.423 --> 00:04:27.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they
don’t really trust them.

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:31.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They keep them confined
with many restrictions.

00:04:31.388 --> 00:04:34.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tell them what to do
and when to do it

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when to get up
and when to go to sleep,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they will eat
and when they will eat,

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they will wear,
and all kinds of other rules.

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:47.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They keep all these restrictions
because they don’t trust them.

00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view your parents
as prison guards at times?

00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might,
especially if you want

00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:57.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more freedom
—more independence.

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if it seems like they
don’t really trust you

00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:03.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re watching every single move
that you make),

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:06.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might feel confined

00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:09.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of all the rules
and restrictions.

00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:11.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about lifeguards?

00:05:11.263 --> 00:05:14.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, lifeguards also watch people;
they watch swimmers,

00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:17.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for a very different reason.

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want
to keep them safe.

00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to make sure
that they do not swim into danger.

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from their lifeguard tower, they keep
a close watch over all the swimmers.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they will use
their whistle to warn you of danger

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to keep away from riptides
or maybe sharks,

00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:37.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that you’re not aware of.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view
your parents as lifeguards?

00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:43.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope so
because they are.

00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:46.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said
that you could spend years

00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:48.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wishing your parents
would get off your back

00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:50.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to realize

00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:54.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re the only ones
who ever really had your back.

00:05:54.892 --> 00:05:57.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, your parents,
like lifeguards,

00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:00.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are looking out
for your best interest.

00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:03.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve always had your back,
and they always will.

00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:09.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to make sure that you will avoid
being drawn into the dangerous currents

00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:14.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this wicked world
—dangers that you may not be aware of.

00:06:14.705 --> 00:06:17.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to be happier?

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to have
more trust from your parents?

00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:23.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more freedom?
more independence?

00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:27.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you might have to change
your view of your parents.

00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:31.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t view them in a negative way
(like they’re prison guards),

00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:33.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but view them like lifeguards,

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:37.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
safeguarding your life.

00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:39.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your parents
love you very much,

00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:43.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their training
will pay off if you listen.

00:06:43.818 --> 00:06:46.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Jehovah
is asking you to do.

00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:48.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While your parents
are training you,

00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:51.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to do your part
—and that is to listen.

00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:55.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what our scripture
at Proverbs chapter 23

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has as an assignment for you.

00:06:58.542 --> 00:07:03.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s chapter 23
of Proverbs in verse 22.

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:06.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there, verse 22
says to you children:

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:10.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Listen to your father
who caused your birth,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and do not despise
[or dislike]

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your mother
just because she has grown old.”

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So although it’s not easy at times,

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is Jehovah asking of you?

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:28.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your parents are training you,
please listen to them.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:31.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean to listen?

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:34.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listening is more
than just hearing words.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hearing
with a view to obeying.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listening to your mother
and your father

00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:45.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means giving them
your full attention

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:47.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—undivided attention.

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:50.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means turning off your music,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking out your earbuds,

00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting away your phone,

00:07:54.768 --> 00:07:59.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoiding rolling your eyes
when they’re speaking to you.

00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:03.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, you may get frustrated;
you may get upset.

00:08:03.777 --> 00:08:05.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s understandable.

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all do,
but how you control your emotions

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will affect
the outcome in the future.

00:08:13.162 --> 00:08:16.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By listening
and obeying your parents,

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:19.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are building
a record of trust

00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help
you in the future

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:25.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you need to communicate with them,
maybe about rules.

00:08:25.383 --> 00:08:29.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
trust is something that you earn;

00:08:29.262 --> 00:08:34.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not something that you demand
or that’s automatic.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:38.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the best way for you
to speak to your parents

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about rules that you don’t understand
or maybe that you don’t agree with?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to communicate

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:48.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good, open communication.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Communication
doesn’t mean complaining,

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:56.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shouting, whining,
maybe replying with sarcasm.

00:08:56.833 --> 00:09:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means calmly telling
your parents how you feel.

00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:04.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell them what’s on your mind.

00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:08.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following Bible verse
helps if we can apply it.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 29:11 says:

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:14.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A stupid person
gives vent to all his feelings

00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:18.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[It’s out of control—no control.],
but the wise one

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calmly keeps them in check
[in control].”

00:09:23.486 --> 00:09:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we want
to try to follow.

00:09:26.155 --> 00:09:30.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A young woman named Devan tried to do this,
and this is what she advises.

00:09:30.618 --> 00:09:34.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says,
“I found that when I stayed calm

00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:36.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and presented
my thoughts clearly,

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:38.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could count on
my parents to listen

00:09:38.835 --> 00:09:41.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and either to reason
with me on their decision

00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:45.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to come up
with another solution.”

00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:49.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents appreciate having
a real conversation with their children

00:09:49.596 --> 00:09:54.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than screaming matches
that end up with slamming doors.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open communication
is what’s needed.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you young ones,
what have we learned?

00:10:01.442 --> 00:10:04.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have learned
how to view our parents correctly,

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:08.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as a prison guard,
but as a lifeguard

00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:12.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really wants to save your life
—your everlasting life.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have your back,
and they always will.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:20.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listening and obeying strengthens
your relationship with your parents

00:10:20.128 --> 00:10:22.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as your heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:10:22.673 --> 00:10:26.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brings you joy
and brings joy to your parents.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you apply the training
that your parents are giving to you,

00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:34.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will gain wisdom
that will help you now

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make wise decisions
so that you can have

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:41.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the real life,
yes, everlasting life.

00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:45.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the concluding video
of this symposium,

00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:50.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please notice how these children
find joy in their parents.

00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:55.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man, I’m so happy today because
that fire drill interrupted our math test.

00:10:55.707 --> 00:10:57.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to do it tomorrow,

00:10:57.209 --> 00:10:58.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’m going to be
studying again all night.

00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:00.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, Dad!
I’ve got to shower before our study.

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:07.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No discussion, no excuses.
Now!

00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:08.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did all of this come from?

00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:16.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be here all night.

00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:27.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did give us time to think.

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:37.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are such good examples.

00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:49.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom never stops working.

00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:55.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our home
is always, always beautiful.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:02.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They give us so much of their time

00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:07.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and themselves.

00:12:08.742 --> 00:12:11.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a bit cheesy sometimes,

00:12:11.203 --> 00:12:14.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but overall, they’re pretty great.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night, they didn’t lecture us.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just reminded us of one thing.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was pretty deep.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our lives include everything

00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:36.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our time, our resources, our home,

00:12:36.396 --> 00:12:37.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our kitchen.

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:39.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our kitchen.

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:43.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we care for those things,
it reflects on him

00:12:43.695 --> 00:12:46.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on us as your parents.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of sank in.

00:12:48.742 --> 00:12:50.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do better.

00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:54.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Mom.
We got this.

00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:58.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um.
We got this?

00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah.
We got this.

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:15.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the daughters
showed respect for their parents?

00:13:15.979 --> 00:13:20.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did this by listening
and obeying their instructions.

00:13:20.192 --> 00:13:22.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the key?

00:13:22.194 --> 00:13:24.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how they viewed
their parents.

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:27.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They reflected
on their parents’ fine example

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry and at home,
where they would take the time

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the patience to help them,
to listen to them.

00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they saw the joy
on their mother’s face

00:13:37.877 --> 00:13:41.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as she kept the home
clean and tidy.

00:13:41.214 --> 00:13:43.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a good example!

00:13:43.258 --> 00:13:45.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They listened
to their parents’ advice,

00:13:45.427 --> 00:13:49.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they
made personal application.

00:13:49.014 --> 00:13:51.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They learned
that showing respect in the family

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:54.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant helping out with chores,

00:13:54.394 --> 00:13:57.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when it meant
doing the dishes.

00:13:57.314 --> 00:14:01.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made their parents happy
and the daughters happy as well.

00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:05.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium, we considered
how husbands and wives,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mothers and fathers,
and children can all add

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:13.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute to the success
of the joy within the family.

00:14:13.915 --> 00:14:16.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do this
by working together in unity,

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:20.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focusing on the positive things
in others

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having respect
for one another.

00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:25.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each in the family,

00:14:25.135 --> 00:14:29.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they apply Bible principles
—use Jehovah’s blueprint—

00:14:29.473 --> 00:14:33.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they know that they can have
a successful and happy family.

00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:36.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of all,
we can make Jehovah happy

00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:39.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—give him honor
as the Designer,

00:14:39.483 --> 00:14:43.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Architect,
and the Creator of all families.

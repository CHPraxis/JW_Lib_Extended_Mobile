00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was an old man,
a very successful one.

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d made a lot of money in his time.

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s not envy him,

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:20.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because for much of his life
he was under a lot of pressure.

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:23.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His first marriage was a troubled one;

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wife was cold and critical.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He raised a large family in the truth,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of his sons
didn’t turn out so well.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few of his friends weren’t there
for him when he needed them most.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lost a child in death.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have guessed
that we’re talking about David,

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the writer of the 37th Psalm.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:58.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was once young,”
he said, but “now I am old.”

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here is an old man
taking stock of his life

00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:06.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sharing a secret with us.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:09.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that helped him to cope

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:12.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when everything around him was going wrong?

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out.

00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:17.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Psalm 37:4.

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:21.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the theme text for our discussion,
so I’ll give you a moment to find that

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:26.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 37:4.

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:29.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And David writes:

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:34.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:39.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:42.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to focus on the first part
of the verse at this point:

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:47.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah.”

00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:52.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exquisite delight,”
or maybe you say exquisite.

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:55.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether you say exquisite or exquisite,

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t use that expression very much,
do we?

00:01:57.806 --> 00:01:59.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But look down at the footnote;

00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Find your greatest joy.”

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:05.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So David is saying,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Find your greatest joy in Jehovah,

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:13.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will give you
the desire of your heart.’

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:17.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was David’s secret.

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:20.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t always count on his family life.

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:24.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he never knew
when a trusted friend would turn against him.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did know his God.

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:32.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that Jehovah
would never disappoint him.

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:35.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a good reminder for us,
isn’t it?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans may disappoint,

00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:41.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, never.

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is our North Star.

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:47.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when we get lost
or when we get confused,

00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:50.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we feel we’ve lost our way,
we really need to look heavenward.

00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look to Jehovah,
and let Jehovah

00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:57.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be our “greatest joy.”

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:01.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To know Jehovah is to love him.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do you do when you
want to get close to someone,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you want to develop
a friendship with someone?

00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:11.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you find ways
to spend time with that person.

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:13.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want that person as a friend.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so you go about finding ways
to spend time with that person.

00:03:18.012 --> 00:03:20.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the same with Jehovah God.

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:23.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want him as our Friend.

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:25.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we do?

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:27.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look for ways to spend time with him—

00:03:27.772 --> 00:03:31.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reading his Word, meditating on his Word,

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:34.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
letting it sink deeply into our heart.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the more we get to know Jehovah,

00:03:37.198 --> 00:03:39.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we love him

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the more at ease
we’ll be in his presence.

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:45.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where prayer comes in.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can develop a friendship with Jehovah

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is so close, so intimate,

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:53.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can confide in Jehovah
things that we would never,

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:57.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever tell another human on earth.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good news?

00:03:59.554 --> 00:04:02.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news is that Jehovah wants

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:06.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
us to get just that close to him.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:10.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we had big plans
for this summer, didn’t we?

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Special conventions,

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regional conventions
in all parts of the earth,

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:18.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happy times, warm fellowship

00:04:18.698 --> 00:04:22.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then the coronavirus.

00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:24.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, at the end of March,

00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:27.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body realized
that we were going to have to make

00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:30.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some important adjustments
as far as the conventions were concerned.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:33.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what to do?

00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the outlines had been prepared
—48 of them.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Teaching Committee
came up with an idea.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have the Governing Body
and many of the helpers

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deliver all of the convention talks
on the program.

00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:50.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll record them,
and then the brothers

00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:52.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all parts of the earth

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:55.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be able to enjoy
the program in safety.

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:58.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this was going to be
a tremendous job

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a number of Bethel departments.

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:05.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sixty members of the Broadcasting Department
here at headquarters

00:05:05.496 --> 00:05:08.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked tirelessly over a three-week period

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to schedule and record the program.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the branches,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of energetic volunteers
in our translation departments

00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:20.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produced the program in 400 languages

00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:24.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—probably more than 400 languages
when it’s all done.

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:28.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, 44 broadcasting departments

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the branches also had a share.

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to all of those who had a share
in making this program possible,

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:41.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all those who were involved in scheduling
and recording and translating,

00:05:41.365 --> 00:05:43.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to say: “Thank you.

00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so very much
for all you’ve done for us.”

00:05:48.164 --> 00:05:51.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking of broadcasting,

00:05:51.626 --> 00:05:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think Jehovah has been preparing us

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for something like this pandemic?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about this:

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:01.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years ago, the decision was made

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:05.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set up something called JW Broadcasting®.

00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:09.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the time, who knew
how practical an arrangement

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:11.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going to turn out to be?

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:16.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who knows what uses JWB
will be put to in the future?

00:06:16.317 --> 00:06:18.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah looks ahead.

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we don’t know ourselves
why certain decisions are made

00:06:23.074 --> 00:06:27.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or why we are making certain decisions,
but Jehovah knows.

00:06:27.203 --> 00:06:30.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is our “greatest joy.”

00:06:30.748 --> 00:06:33.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s another thing:

00:06:33.334 --> 00:06:36.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the theme
for this convention was being chosen,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no coronavirus on the horizon.

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:44.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, can you think of a better theme
for a convention than this one?

00:06:44.262 --> 00:06:48.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy—what an appropriate theme
for a convention!

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of you have lost your jobs,

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others have been very sick
during the past few months,

00:06:56.566 --> 00:07:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few of you
have lost loved ones in death.

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no way you can be happy
about those circumstances.

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:08.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can rejoice
in your knowledge of Jehovah.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can rejoice in your knowledge

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Jehovah God
has in store for us in the future.

00:07:14.543 --> 00:07:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People outside don’t have that.

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:18.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice in Jehovah.

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice
how well our convention program

00:07:24.428 --> 00:07:29.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
matched up with the theme
for this year’s yeartext?

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:32.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”

00:07:32.144 --> 00:07:37.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had so much information
on how to improve on our teaching skills.

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think that is?

00:07:39.484 --> 00:07:43.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be that there’s
a lot more work to do in that respect?

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:47.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know
when the great tribulation is going to come,

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:51.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are determined
to keep busy until the end does come.

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:55.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wasn’t it a good idea
to have us follow the progress

00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:59.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Bible student, Jade, as Neeta

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:02.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcame one challenge after another?

00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:04.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was realistic, wasn’t it?

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a transformation!

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:10.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade isn’t “jaded” anymore.

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:14.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was
a subtle message in those videos:

00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should never,
ever trust first impressions.

00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:22.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First impressions can be wrong.

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:26.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whether you’re conducting
a study right now or not,

00:08:26.657 --> 00:08:28.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you can hardly wait
to get back to the field

00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to apply some of those suggestions.

00:08:31.454 --> 00:08:35.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful part
of the program that was!

00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:38.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about
other parts of the program?

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember
some of these highlights?

00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:42.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:48.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses
around the world,

00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:53.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each finding a way

00:08:53.893 --> 00:08:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be joyful.

00:08:58.022 --> 00:09:00.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the trials we face,

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:02.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can find joy

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:05.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the choices we’re making, 

00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:11.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the families we’re raising, 

00:09:13.413 --> 00:09:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the creation we’re observing, 

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:25.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the peace we’re promoting.

00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:28.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy is found

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the message we’re preaching.

00:09:35.268 --> 00:09:38.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises us joy despite 

00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:40.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the trials we’re enduring

00:09:40.774 --> 00:09:43.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and persecution we’re facing.

00:09:43.318 --> 00:09:45.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promises us joy

00:09:45.278 --> 00:09:47.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the stand we’re taking.

00:09:49.032 --> 00:09:51.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through anything in life,

00:09:51.117 --> 00:09:53.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can find joy in Jehovah.

00:09:54.371 --> 00:09:56.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants you to be happy.

00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:00.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His joy can be yours

00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:01.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and forever!

00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:07.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will you accept it?

00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:13.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has the right to expect
that we’ll love him

00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:17.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more than we love
our husband, our wife,

00:10:17.144 --> 00:10:20.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our son or daughter, or our parents.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also has the right to expect

00:10:22.316 --> 00:10:24.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll love him
more than we love our job,

00:10:24.568 --> 00:10:26.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a favorite hobby,

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe a sport
that we’re passionate about.

00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:34.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has to come first.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has your desire to put Jehovah first

00:10:38.957 --> 00:10:41.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
been tested during this pandemic?

00:10:41.168 --> 00:10:43.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You lost your job,

00:10:43.337 --> 00:10:47.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you searched desperately
for another one.

00:10:47.216 --> 00:10:51.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, after a long search,
you found one,

00:10:51.595 --> 00:10:53.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was a job that would require you

00:10:53.847 --> 00:10:57.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to miss all your meetings
and opportunities for field service.

00:10:57.726 --> 00:11:01.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a temptation to take that job!

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:03.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been out of work for months.

00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:06.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You felt helpless, because a family member

00:11:06.277 --> 00:11:09.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is supposed to provide for his family.

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would take a lot of faith
for you to refuse that job,

00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray to Jehovah, and then wait,

00:11:17.872 --> 00:11:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold on a little longer

00:11:19.915 --> 00:11:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what Jehovah
would work out for you,

00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing that Jehovah has to come first,

00:11:27.548 --> 00:11:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when it comes
to providing for our family.

00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the example of the Jews

00:11:32.553 --> 00:11:36.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, captivity in Babylon
wasn’t as harsh as slavery in Egypt.

00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jews in Babylon could build a house,

00:11:46.317 --> 00:11:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
run a business, plant a vineyard,
get comfortable in life.

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them even got rich.

00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:56.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scholars believe that it was in Babylon

00:11:56.828 --> 00:11:58.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Jews learned about the art

00:11:58.913 --> 00:12:01.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of buying and selling, trade, and commerce.

00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:05.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would take real faith on their part

00:12:05.837 --> 00:12:10.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave their house, their business,

00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:15.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close friends and relatives
who wanted to remain in Babylon

00:12:15.472 --> 00:12:20.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go to Jerusalem
—a city with none of the glitz of Babylon,

00:12:20.477 --> 00:12:24.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city that most of them had never seen.

00:12:24.564 --> 00:12:28.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would take real faith.

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:32.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the returning Jews
got off to a great start.

00:12:32.364 --> 00:12:36.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They constructed
the foundation of the temple,

00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:39.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then they ran into problems.

00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:41.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was danger.

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:44.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how would they show that Jehovah

00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:46.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes first in the face of danger?

00:12:46.837 --> 00:12:50.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they keep on building the temple
in spite of the danger.

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:53.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do they do?

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they got scared,
and they talked themselves

00:12:57.931 --> 00:13:00.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into believing that it mustn’t be
Jehovah’s will

00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:02.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for them to build the temple.

00:13:02.853 --> 00:13:04.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:13:04.855 --> 00:13:06.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it was hard.

00:13:06.857 --> 00:13:10.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they started
looking after themselves,

00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:13.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking after their own interests.

00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:16.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now remember, Jerusalem was in ruins.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t going to be easy
to start a business,

00:13:20.162 --> 00:13:24.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plant crops, and build a house
in a ruined city.

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:27.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they didn’t say,
“Oh, this is hard;

00:13:27.795 --> 00:13:29.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so it mustn’t be Jehovah’s will

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to feed my family.”

00:13:31.966 --> 00:13:34.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They found a way to feed their family.

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:37.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they should’ve had
the same determination

00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:39.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it came to Jehovah’s worship

00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:43.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah has to come first.

00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:46.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these were good people.

00:13:46.397 --> 00:13:48.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had had enough faith to leave Babylon

00:13:48.983 --> 00:13:51.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and return to Jerusalem in the first place.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that first love had cooled off.

00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:57.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s see how Jehovah felt about that.

00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Haggai chapter 1,

00:14:00.703 --> 00:14:03.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read
a few verses at Haggai,

00:14:03.247 --> 00:14:05.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so keep your Bibles open there, please.

00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:07.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to turn to Haggai chapter 1.

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:11.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And first of all,
we’re going to read verses 2 through 6

00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah felt

00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:16.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about this choice
that the Jews had made,

00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:21.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting themselves ahead
of his worship in spite of danger.

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:26.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“These people say,
‘The time has not yet come

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:33.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the house of Jehovah to be built.’”’

00:14:33.486 --> 00:14:36.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the word of Jehovah again
came through Haggai the prophet,

00:14:36.823 --> 00:14:39.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying: ‘Is it the time

00:14:39.409 --> 00:14:42.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you to dwell in your paneled houses,

00:14:42.328 --> 00:14:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while this house lies in ruins?’

00:14:45.748 --> 00:14:49.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now this is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set your heart on your ways.

00:14:51.838 --> 00:14:55.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You have sown much seed,
but you harvest little.

00:14:55.842 --> 00:14:59.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You eat, but it is not to satisfaction.

00:14:59.137 --> 00:15:02.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You drink, but you do not drink your fill.

00:15:02.307 --> 00:15:06.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:15:06.144 --> 00:15:09.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The one who hires himself out

00:15:09.314 --> 00:15:13.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
puts his wages in a bag full of holes.’”

00:15:13.526 --> 00:15:16.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, do you think Jehovah
didn’t want them

00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:19.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build a house or feed their family?

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:25.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah’s worship has to come first.

00:15:25.622 --> 00:15:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what exclusive devotion
is all about.

00:15:29.418 --> 00:15:32.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what else
do we learn from these verses?

00:15:32.295 --> 00:15:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s Jehovah telling the people?

00:15:34.297 --> 00:15:35.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s saying: ‘Look at you.

00:15:35.882 --> 00:15:38.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You work and work and work.

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:40.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’re not getting anywhere.

00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:45.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re aren’t getting rich,
and you aren’t even making ends meet.’

00:15:45.183 --> 00:15:47.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:50.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have the blessing of Jehovah.

00:15:50.564 --> 00:15:54.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
 that makes one rich.”

00:15:55.736 --> 00:15:59.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one of the scenes
from our dramatic Bible reading

00:15:59.156 --> 00:16:01.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrates this point very well.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s remind ourselves.

00:16:03.035 --> 00:16:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have a look.

00:16:05.621 --> 00:16:08.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah compares the results
of the Jews’ self-centered efforts

00:16:08.582 --> 00:16:11.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those of a hired worker who puts

00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:13.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wages into a moth-eaten sack.

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:17.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Jews
are neglecting the house of Jehovah,

00:16:17.925 --> 00:16:20.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he holds back his blessing.

00:16:20.302 --> 00:16:23.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the Jews’ labor are limited,

00:16:23.097 --> 00:16:25.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their lives lack joy.

00:16:25.766 --> 00:16:29.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidently, some try to fill that void

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:32.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by beautifying their own homes.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But <i>material</i> things
cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we see the warning here for us?

00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:42.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not wrong to enjoy nice things.

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:44.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But material things

00:16:44.827 --> 00:16:48.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot bring us true and lasting joy,

00:16:48.372 --> 00:16:53.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if we neglect
Jehovah’s work to obtain them.

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:58.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s nothing wrong
with buying new things.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think many of us
still have a black-and-white TV.

00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:05.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is, Jehovah must come first.

00:17:05.556 --> 00:17:09.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the Jews
were facing stiff opposition.

00:17:09.352 --> 00:17:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was danger.

00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:15.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I want you to notice a little detail
as we read Haggai 1:7, 8.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told you to keep your Bibles open.

00:17:18.027 --> 00:17:22.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t, but I’ve got it again
—Haggai 1:7, 8.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice, the Jews are in danger.

00:17:26.452 --> 00:17:31.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are opposers,
but we’re looking for a little detail

00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:36.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that should have reassured
the Jews in verses 7 and 8:

00:17:37.255 --> 00:17:42.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set your heart on your ways.

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:47.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber.

00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And build the house,
so that I may take pleasure in it

00:17:52.354 --> 00:17:56.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I may be a glorified,’ Jehovah says.”

00:17:56.232 --> 00:18:00.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see it—“Jehovah of armies”?

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:03.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that expression
is repeated over and over again

00:18:03.823 --> 00:18:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Haggai,
and it should have reassured the Jews

00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:10.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their enemies were nothing

00:18:10.247 --> 00:18:14.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in comparison with Jehovah
and his armies.

00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jehovah telling the Jews:
‘Go ahead.

00:18:18.463 --> 00:18:21.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build the temple. I have your back.’

00:18:24.094 --> 00:18:28.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find your “greatest joy” in Jehovah.

00:18:28.682 --> 00:18:31.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s really the theme
that we’re talking about today.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about it.

00:18:34.187 --> 00:18:38.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s talk about some aspects
of this very important theme.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, we’ll talk
about our relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s so important.

00:18:43.572 --> 00:18:46.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction to this talk,
we mentioned David.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a lot of problems,
maybe more than most of us.

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:53.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he never lost his joy.

00:18:53.957 --> 00:18:58.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He found joy
in his relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:58.253 --> 00:19:03.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, his physical living conditions
weren’t always the best.

00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When King Saul was alive,
David was on the run most of the time.

00:19:07.596 --> 00:19:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did he sleep?

00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:13.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a cave,
in a place “difficult to approach,”

00:19:13.644 --> 00:19:15.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just anywhere that was safe.

00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:19.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then at times David
and his men ran low on food.

00:19:19.817 --> 00:19:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they ran out of food.

00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:24.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know the feeling?

00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:27.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been low on food
during this pandemic?

00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:31.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David couldn’t even enjoy
a normal married life

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:33.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’d married the daughter of Saul,

00:19:33.956 --> 00:19:37.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then Saul had given her to another man.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what got him through all that?

00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:42.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:42.507 --> 00:19:46.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was the constant in his life.

00:19:46.177 --> 00:19:48.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you could just feel
the unbreakable bond

00:19:48.763 --> 00:19:53.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah and David
when you read the 16th Psalm.

00:19:53.351 --> 00:19:55.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s something
very interesting about this Psalm.

00:19:55.728 --> 00:19:57.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there.

00:19:59.107 --> 00:20:03.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And first of all, we’re just going
to look at verse 1 briefly.

00:20:05.238 --> 00:20:07.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 16,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice in verse 1
the situation that David is in.

00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:17.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is in need of protection.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:22.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some unstated way,
David is in danger.

00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:25.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what’s interesting
about this Psalm?

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:28.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the rest of it,
he doesn’t dwell on his problems.

00:20:28.303 --> 00:20:32.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He dwells on the way
Jehovah is helping him with his problems.

00:20:32.724 --> 00:20:37.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 8, David says:

00:20:37.062 --> 00:20:41.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I keep Jehovah before me constantly.

00:20:41.691 --> 00:20:46.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he is at my right hand,
I will never be shaken.”

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:49.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with his eyes of faith,

00:20:49.866 --> 00:20:54.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David could see
Jehovah beside him, protecting him.

00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:57.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we can have that vision,
we’re not going to be afraid

00:20:57.332 --> 00:21:00.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of anything or anyone, are we?

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, find your “greatest joy” in Jehovah?

00:21:04.047 --> 00:21:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a man who is in need of protection.

00:21:06.174 --> 00:21:08.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a man who feels he’s in danger.

00:21:08.176 --> 00:21:10.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 9:

00:21:10.178 --> 00:21:15.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So my heart rejoices,
my whole being is joyful.

00:21:15.183 --> 00:21:18.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I reside in security.”

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s in danger in some way,
and yet he feels safe.

00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He feels secure.

00:21:23.484 --> 00:21:25.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then notice verse 10.

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:29.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually we apply verse 10
to the resurrection of Jesus.

00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:31.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think of it from David’s perspective:

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For you will not leave me in the Grave.”

00:21:35.788 --> 00:21:40.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David knew that even if somehow
he were to die,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would not leave him in the Grave.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would resurrect him.

00:21:44.713 --> 00:21:47.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of verse 11,
a beautiful expression:

00:21:47.841 --> 00:21:52.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In your presence is abundant joy.”

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you notice the expressions

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:00.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my heart rejoices,”
“my whole being is joyful,”

00:22:00.563 --> 00:22:04.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in your presence is abundant joy”?

00:22:04.817 --> 00:22:07.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s life wasn’t always easy,

00:22:07.987 --> 00:22:11.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but feeling that he was
in the presence of Jehovah

00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:14.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feeling the support of Jehovah—

00:22:14.035 --> 00:22:19.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped him to get through it
and to get through it with joy.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your life isn’t always easy.

00:22:22.209 --> 00:22:24.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ve had many

00:22:24.337 --> 00:22:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anxious moments during this pandemic.

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, you turned away from your problems,

00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you focused on Jehovah God, and you reset.

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:39.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your joy returned.

00:22:39.352 --> 00:22:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many reasons for joy can you think of?

00:22:43.773 --> 00:22:46.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song says they’re “abundant.”

00:22:46.192 --> 00:22:48.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think of a few.

00:22:48.361 --> 00:22:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one: Jesus said:

00:22:51.155 --> 00:22:56.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No man [no man] can come to me

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless the Father . . . draws him.”

00:22:59.289 --> 00:23:01.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think what that means.

00:23:01.291 --> 00:23:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw something in you that he loves.

00:23:05.628 --> 00:23:08.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looked down, and he said:

00:23:08.006 --> 00:23:12.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want that person in the new world.”

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t try to argue with Jehovah.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t say: “You made a mistake.

00:23:17.807 --> 00:23:19.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You don’t mean me.

00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:20.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must mean the fellow next to me.

00:23:20.727 --> 00:23:23.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But me?
I’m not worth it.”

00:23:23.313 --> 00:23:28.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah drew <i>you</i> to the truth.

00:23:28.318 --> 00:23:30.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept it.

00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:33.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept it.

00:23:33.073 --> 00:23:36.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God loves you.

00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:39.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that is a reason for joy.

00:23:39.955 --> 00:23:44.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another reason for joy
is that Jehovah answers our prayers.

00:23:44.251 --> 00:23:47.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always available,
always ready to listen.

00:23:47.796 --> 00:23:51.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can pray
in any language at any time.

00:23:51.091 --> 00:23:54.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah won’t always do
what we ask him to do,

00:23:54.177 --> 00:23:57.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will always listen.

00:23:57.681 --> 00:24:01.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find joy in Jehovah’s service
because he’s reasonable

00:24:01.685 --> 00:24:03.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what he expects of us.

00:24:03.812 --> 00:24:06.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You come home after a long day’s work;

00:24:06.565 --> 00:24:10.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re exhausted, worn out, stressed out.

00:24:10.652 --> 00:24:15.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You come home from field service
or from the meeting; you’re refreshed.

00:24:15.657 --> 00:24:18.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is reasonable.

00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re also confident that Jehovah

00:24:20.996 --> 00:24:23.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will provide our food and clothing

00:24:23.248 --> 00:24:25.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how dire the situation gets.

00:24:25.709 --> 00:24:29.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what he provides
might not always be fancy,

00:24:29.129 --> 00:24:31.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’ll always be enough.

00:24:31.298 --> 00:24:34.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll always be adequate to get us through.

00:24:34.343 --> 00:24:37.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we should always be grateful
for anything Jehovah provides,

00:24:37.972 --> 00:24:41.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how simple it might be.

00:24:41.183 --> 00:24:44.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A researcher once drew a distinction

00:24:44.103 --> 00:24:47.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah’s Witnesses
and some others

00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:50.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were in concentration camps
in Nazi Germany.

00:24:50.693 --> 00:24:54.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A non-Witness might say:
“Where are the gods?

00:24:54.947 --> 00:24:58.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I have to eat
is this miserable piece of bread.”

00:24:58.868 --> 00:25:02.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Witness in the same camp

00:25:02.246 --> 00:25:06.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might say: “Oh, Jehovah, thank you.

00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:08.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have a piece of bread to eat.

00:25:08.794 --> 00:25:12.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can eat and regain my strength

00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and live just a little longer to serve you.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:19.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe I’ll be able to share
some of my bread with someone else.”

00:25:19.555 --> 00:25:24.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conclusion of the researcher:
Both received the piece of bread.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was all in the point of view.

00:25:27.313 --> 00:25:30.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Witness had a spiritual point of view,

00:25:30.358 --> 00:25:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Witness was grateful

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:38.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for even a simple provision
that Jehovah had made.

00:25:38.032 --> 00:25:40.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, during this pandemic,

00:25:40.034 --> 00:25:43.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could be that your menu
has been greatly simplified.

00:25:43.162 --> 00:25:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you haven’t been able to eat
the way you would normally eat.

00:25:47.083 --> 00:25:50.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had just pasta or rice to eat,

00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:52.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you didn’t say: “Look at this.

00:25:52.964 --> 00:25:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I have to eat is pasta.
All I have to eat is rice.”

00:25:57.093 --> 00:26:01.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You thanked Jehovah
for the rice or for the pasta.

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:03.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were grateful for the provisions.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you realized
that no matter how simple,

00:26:06.728 --> 00:26:10.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these provisions came from Jehovah.

00:26:10.941 --> 00:26:15.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has also given us
a loving spiritual family.

00:26:15.403 --> 00:26:18.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think many of us
have come to the conclusion

00:26:18.573 --> 00:26:21.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we never really understood

00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a loving spiritual family we have
until this pandemic.

00:26:26.415 --> 00:26:29.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A young married couple were both afflicted

00:26:29.835 --> 00:26:32.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the coronavirus—both of them.

00:26:32.921 --> 00:26:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how would they eat?

00:26:34.297 --> 00:26:37.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t go out shopping,
and they couldn’t see anyone.

00:26:37.843 --> 00:26:40.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother said,

00:26:40.012 --> 00:26:43.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We had groceries at the door constantly.”

00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:47.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wife says,
“I felt I had Jehovah’s

00:26:47.477 --> 00:26:52.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone else’s arms
wrapped around me.”

00:26:52.483 --> 00:26:57.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Social distancing
doesn’t apply to Jehovah.

00:26:57.488 --> 00:27:01.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can wrap his arms around anyone.

00:27:01.366 --> 00:27:04.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers have been reconnecting

00:27:04.036 --> 00:27:07.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with long-lost return visits
and unbelieving family members

00:27:07.706 --> 00:27:10.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starting Bible studies with them.

00:27:10.084 --> 00:27:14.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you probably know,
meeting attendance has increased,

00:27:14.004 --> 00:27:16.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inactive and disfellowshipped persons

00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:19.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also trying to draw close to Jehovah.

00:27:19.343 --> 00:27:21.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One disfellowshipped person said,

00:27:21.428 --> 00:27:23.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I view this

00:27:23.514 --> 00:27:27.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one last warning from Jehovah.”

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:32.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just a word to any
who may be listening

00:27:32.398 --> 00:27:35.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are no longer serving Jehovah.

00:27:35.818 --> 00:27:38.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:27:38.362 --> 00:27:40.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God loves you.

00:27:40.614 --> 00:27:42.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God wants you to return.

00:27:42.908 --> 00:27:46.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to put his arms
around you once more.

00:27:46.495 --> 00:27:51.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please, take advantage
of the invitation, and come back.

00:27:51.459 --> 00:27:54.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please, don’t give in to the idea,

00:27:54.378 --> 00:27:57.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I’ve done nothing up to now,
and now there’s been a pandemic,

00:27:57.673 --> 00:27:59.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and if I come back to the truth,

00:27:59.675 --> 00:28:02.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, Jehovah is not going to accept me.’

00:28:02.053 --> 00:28:04.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read your Bible.

00:28:04.138 --> 00:28:06.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find that in many cases,

00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:09.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a disaster of some sort
that caused people

00:28:09.894 --> 00:28:12.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to their senses
and return to Jehovah,

00:28:12.563 --> 00:28:15.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah lovingly accepted them.

00:28:15.733 --> 00:28:19.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of Manasseh as an example.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have commented
that they’ve actually drawn closer

00:28:23.324 --> 00:28:26.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their brothers and sisters
during this pandemic.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many, many say,

00:28:28.496 --> 00:28:32.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I feel more cared for than ever.”

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find joy in our relationship

00:28:36.337 --> 00:28:39.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah
and with our brothers.

00:28:39.758 --> 00:28:42.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we were talking about David.

00:28:42.594 --> 00:28:44.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in Psalm 16

00:28:44.804 --> 00:28:48.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there “is abundant joy” in Jehovah.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was his joy based on?

00:28:50.727 --> 00:28:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t based on his privileges

00:28:53.229 --> 00:28:56.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—David didn’t become king for years—

00:28:56.483 --> 00:28:59.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was on his relationship with Jehovah.

00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:02.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a good example for us.

00:29:02.322 --> 00:29:05.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that there is a privilege

00:29:05.242 --> 00:29:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve been expecting
that seems a long time coming.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do in the meantime?

00:29:09.663 --> 00:29:12.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep working
on your relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:14.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep strengthening that relationship.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be the best investment
you’ve ever made.

00:29:19.006 --> 00:29:23.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget
the greatest privilege any of us can have

00:29:23.552 --> 00:29:26.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to bear the name of Jehovah,

00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be called one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:29:29.766 --> 00:29:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re part of a family
of brothers and sisters

00:29:33.854 --> 00:29:38.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who love us and who would
even risk their lives for us.

00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:41.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve discussed finding joy

00:29:41.612 --> 00:29:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:44.615 --> 00:29:46.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a second aspect,

00:29:46.617 --> 00:29:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is finding joy in the Bible,

00:29:50.746 --> 00:29:55.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finding joy in God’s written Word.

00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:57.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get to know Jehovah best

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:01.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reading his Word and meditating on it.

00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:04.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in recent times,
the congregation Bible reading

00:30:04.635 --> 00:30:07.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been shortened,
and there’s a good reason for that.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not so we can get
our Bible reading over with

00:30:10.933 --> 00:30:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get on to other things.

00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:16.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so that we will take our time,
slow down,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditate on what we’re reading.

00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:21.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chew it up; digest it thoroughly.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jehovah talking to you and to me,
sharing his thoughts with us.

00:30:26.365 --> 00:30:30.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is amazing,
and we need to appreciate it.

00:30:30.077 --> 00:30:34.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one way
that we can enjoy our Bible reading

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to make the connection
between what we’re reading now

00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:41.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we’ve read in the past
and see how they match up.

00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:44.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example—just a short one.

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:49.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Numbers chapter 12

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:54.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Numbers 12:1, 2.

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:58.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the setting
is pretty self-explanatory.

00:30:58.564 --> 00:31:03.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Numbers 12:1, 2:

00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:08.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Miriam and Aaron
began to speak against Moses

00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:11.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the Cushite wife he had married,

00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:14.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he had taken a Cushite wife.

00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:19.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were saying: ‘Is it only by Moses
that Jehovah has spoken?

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:22.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has he not also spoken through us?’”

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was their argument?

00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:30.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, in plain English,
their argument was that Moses

00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:35.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was hogging the limelight,
that he wanted to be the center of attention.

00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:37.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is that true?

00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:41.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the previous chapter
—chapter 11—

00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:43.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we read?

00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:47.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses willingly shares his authority

00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:52.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 70 of the men of the elders of Israel.

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:54.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there was no serious question

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Moses wanting to have the limelight.

00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:01.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was a humble man.

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:05.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, this is Numbers chapter 12.

00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:07.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Aaron

00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:11.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
questioning Moses’ authority.

00:32:11.013 --> 00:32:14.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can learn a little bit more about this

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:16.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from something that is tucked far away

00:32:16.727 --> 00:32:18.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Deuteronomy.

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:22.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Deuteronomy chapter 9,

00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:24.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to see
if we can learn something

00:32:24.485 --> 00:32:28.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Aaron and why Aaron’s attitude

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was so shocking

00:32:30.199 --> 00:32:35.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Deuteronomy 9:20.

00:32:35.204 --> 00:32:39.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a revelation.

00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:43.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Moses
in the very last month of his life,

00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:45.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking to the Israelites,
and he says:

00:32:45.673 --> 00:32:50.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was so angry with Aaron

00:32:50.052 --> 00:32:53.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he was ready to annihilate him,

00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:57.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I made supplication for Aaron.”

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:01.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron owed his life to Moses.

00:33:01.439 --> 00:33:06.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he dares
to question Moses’ leadership

00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the nation of Israel.

00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is really shocking.

00:33:10.948 --> 00:33:14.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what does this teach you about Moses?

00:33:14.035 --> 00:33:16.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is a very humble man,

00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:19.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s not quick to take credit for things.

00:33:19.749 --> 00:33:22.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do we say that?

00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Moses wrote the book of Exodus
and the story of the golden calf,

00:33:27.006 --> 00:33:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never mentioned that Jehovah
wanted to annihilate Aaron

00:33:31.302 --> 00:33:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his part in the golden-calf incident.

00:33:34.555 --> 00:33:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron was still alive,

00:33:36.724 --> 00:33:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Moses spared Aaron that indignity.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s only after Aaron’s death

00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the very last month
of Moses’ life that we learn about it.

00:33:49.862 --> 00:33:54.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that tell you something
about how kind and humble Moses was?

00:33:54.868 --> 00:33:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is just to illustrate the fact

00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:03.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we try to take one point
that we’ve learned in the past

00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:05.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and connect it up
with what we’re reading now,

00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:08.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will often help
the Bible reading to come alive.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider some of the things

00:34:10.884 --> 00:34:13.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s Word has done for us.

00:34:13.845 --> 00:34:17.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what it was like
before you came into the truth?

00:34:17.682 --> 00:34:21.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A favorite relative of yours
who was happily married

00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:24.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lost her husband in death.

00:34:24.648 --> 00:34:28.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the funeral, a priest told her

00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:30.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that her husband was in purgatory.

00:34:30.529 --> 00:34:32.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And unless the widow paid up,

00:34:32.531 --> 00:34:35.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was going to stay there for a long time.

00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:37.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d just lost her husband.

00:34:37.828 --> 00:34:40.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting was that?

00:34:40.163 --> 00:34:43.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then you started studying the Bible.

00:34:43.834 --> 00:34:48.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You came to Romans 6:7:

00:34:48.797 --> 00:34:53.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who has died
has been acquitted from his sin.”

00:34:53.802 --> 00:34:56.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Acquitted from his sin”

00:34:56.388 --> 00:34:59.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and your Bible teacher
explained what that means.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that when you die,
the debt is paid.

00:35:03.854 --> 00:35:06.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t go on paying after death.

00:35:06.899 --> 00:35:11.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t suffer in hell,
and you don’t suffer in purgatory.

00:35:11.528 --> 00:35:15.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That one Bible verse
could completely change your view

00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what happens at death.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
maybe you grew up in a family

00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:25.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where evolution was the order of the day

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:29.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so no hope, no hope for the future.

00:35:29.713 --> 00:35:32.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This life is all there is.

00:35:32.758 --> 00:35:35.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you came to learn

00:35:35.302 --> 00:35:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have a heavenly Father
who loves you very much

00:35:38.514 --> 00:35:41.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who wants to give you
a future and a hope.

00:35:41.559 --> 00:35:45.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it was to discover Jehovah!

00:35:45.771 --> 00:35:47.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us grew up in a family

00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:50.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the parents didn’t get along so well.

00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:52.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t point to them and say,

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now that is how
a man should treat his wife,”

00:35:55.406 --> 00:35:58.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “That is how a woman
should treat her husband.”

00:35:58.909 --> 00:36:01.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just didn’t get along.

00:36:01.454 --> 00:36:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed Jehovah; we needed the Bible;

00:36:03.706 --> 00:36:05.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we needed Jehovah’s organization

00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:09.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach us how to have a happy family life.

00:36:09.629 --> 00:36:12.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s more.

00:36:12.048 --> 00:36:15.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently a clergyman
was asked by a journalist

00:36:15.134 --> 00:36:19.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why pandemics like the coronavirus occur.

00:36:19.097 --> 00:36:21.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the clergyman answered,

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, suffering is part of life.”

00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:27.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That didn’t answer the question.

00:36:27.522 --> 00:36:30.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journalist wasn’t asking, ‘Do we suffer?’

00:36:30.984 --> 00:36:33.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journalist knew that we suffer.

00:36:33.152 --> 00:36:36.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journalist wanted to know why we suffer.

00:36:36.698 --> 00:36:38.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t get an answer.

00:36:38.992 --> 00:36:41.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A professor of New Testament theology

00:36:41.369 --> 00:36:45.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was asked the same question,
Why do we suffer?

00:36:45.123 --> 00:36:47.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what he said?

00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:49.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everybody suffers.

00:36:49.502 --> 00:36:51.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God suffers.”

00:36:51.504 --> 00:36:54.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of an answer is that?

00:36:54.257 --> 00:36:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy we are to have the answers

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those questions from the Bible.

00:37:00.055 --> 00:37:03.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking about God’s written Word,

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:08.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since 1966, Jehovah’s organization
has made the Bible come alive

00:37:08.855 --> 00:37:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the most outstanding way
through the Bible dramas.

00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:16.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really has made the Bible come alive,
hasn’t it?

00:37:16.238 --> 00:37:19.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s helped us to visualize
what life was like in Bible times,

00:37:19.407 --> 00:37:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve come to realize
that people living in Bible times

00:37:22.744 --> 00:37:26.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weren’t really so very different
from people who are living today.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s review a few scenes
and see what lessons we can glean.

00:37:31.545 --> 00:37:33.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a look.

00:37:40.846 --> 00:37:42.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham!

00:37:43.307 --> 00:37:45.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a visitor last night.

00:37:47.269 --> 00:37:49.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was your wife,

00:37:52.191 --> 00:37:54.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or should I say your former wife.

00:37:55.611 --> 00:37:56.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:37:56.779 --> 00:37:59.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you care how you’ve hurt your innocent mate?

00:37:59.782 --> 00:38:01.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:38:01.784 --> 00:38:04.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look! Moses said if you find something

00:38:04.203 --> 00:38:06.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indecent with your wife, a man must write

00:38:06.455 --> 00:38:08.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a certificate of divorce, hand it to her,

00:38:08.374 --> 00:38:09.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dismiss her.

00:38:09.792 --> 00:38:13.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If giving me no children isn’t indecent, then what is?

00:38:13.712 --> 00:38:15.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m tired of living with her.

00:38:15.881 --> 00:38:17.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m marrying Gizla today.

00:38:17.508 --> 00:38:19.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gizla?

00:38:19.134 --> 00:38:21.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Moabite girl?

00:38:22.513 --> 00:38:25.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse

00:38:25.015 --> 00:38:26.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to take a wife from the nations!

00:38:26.934 --> 00:38:29.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Law says: “They will turn your sons away

00:38:29.478 --> 00:38:31.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from following me to serve other gods;

00:38:31.772 --> 00:38:34.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you”!

00:38:34.692 --> 00:38:36.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are you to counsel me?

00:38:36.861 --> 00:38:38.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every man must find his own joy,

00:38:38.904 --> 00:38:41.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I intend to find mine.

00:38:41.365 --> 00:38:45.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really think you can give

00:38:47.246 --> 00:38:48.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yourself more joy than he can?

00:38:56.464 --> 00:38:58.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:38:58.674 --> 00:39:03.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our “greatest joy” comes
when we obey Jehovah.

00:39:03.554 --> 00:39:06.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look again.

00:39:10.144 --> 00:39:11.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come along.

00:39:11.521 --> 00:39:14.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Ana la mitbayen.</i>

00:39:14.148 --> 00:39:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here!

00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:17.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to listen to me. I’m your father!

00:39:17.944 --> 00:39:19.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with your children?

00:39:20.947 --> 00:39:23.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t like coming to the temple.

00:39:23.366 --> 00:39:27.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sweetie, why don’t you like it?

00:39:27.328 --> 00:39:28.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Shvok Y-ati!</i>

00:39:29.956 --> 00:39:31.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here now!

00:39:35.253 --> 00:39:37.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, my lord.

00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:39.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:39:40.633 --> 00:39:43.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:39:43.428 --> 00:39:44.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:39:44.888 --> 00:39:46.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:39:47.724 --> 00:39:49.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not?

00:39:49.392 --> 00:39:50.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! Yes!

00:39:50.477 --> 00:39:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah

00:39:52.354 --> 00:39:54.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your own oath?

00:39:54.481 --> 00:39:55.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me go!

00:39:55.607 --> 00:39:58.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder your children don’t love Jehovah.

00:39:58.318 --> 00:39:59.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aah!

00:39:59.444 --> 00:40:01.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you imagine that you could succeed

00:40:01.154 --> 00:40:02.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without Jehovah’s blessing?

00:40:02.906 --> 00:40:04.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for Jehovah’s blessing!

00:40:04.449 --> 00:40:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you?

00:40:05.408 --> 00:40:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you didn’t obey him.

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:10.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, how can Jehovah bless something

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is against his will?

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the lesson here?

00:40:19.214 --> 00:40:21.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t answer prayers

00:40:21.383 --> 00:40:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not in harmony with his will.

00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:26.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again—

00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:34.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that all about?

00:40:35.898 --> 00:40:37.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham refuses to move into Jerusalem,

00:40:41.987 --> 00:40:43.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to support him.

00:40:43.989 --> 00:40:45.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you say?

00:40:47.284 --> 00:40:50.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him Nehemiah is doing Jehovah’s will.

00:40:51.997 --> 00:40:53.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham doesn’t understand how happy

00:40:53.999 --> 00:40:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be if-if he would just follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:41:00.548 --> 00:41:03.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we will move if we are selected?

00:41:05.386 --> 00:41:06.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:41:08.764 --> 00:41:13.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d rather be like Nehemiah than like Raham.

00:41:13.227 --> 00:41:14.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You agree?

00:41:14.687 --> 00:41:16.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:41:16.147 --> 00:41:18.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:41:20.818 --> 00:41:22.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson?

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy families follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:41:27.283 --> 00:41:32.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are a lot more lessons
to be learned from this drama.

00:41:32.288 --> 00:41:36.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can discover them
as you review it at home.

00:41:36.083 --> 00:41:41.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You guessed it,
we’re releasing the drama today.

00:41:41.088 --> 00:41:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can access it following this talk.

00:41:44.258 --> 00:41:48.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairman will show you how.

00:41:48.096 --> 00:41:53.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may applaud.

00:41:53.101 --> 00:41:57.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we find joy
in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:41:57.814 --> 00:42:00.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find joy in studying his Word

00:42:00.483 --> 00:42:03.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discovering beautiful things in his Word.

00:42:03.444 --> 00:42:06.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about Jehovah’s name?

00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:10.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we find joy in Jehovah’s name as well?

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly in the last few years,

00:42:13.872 --> 00:42:17.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of emphasis has been placed
on Jehovah’s name.

00:42:17.208 --> 00:42:19.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Warwick, in the museum,

00:42:19.794 --> 00:42:23.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we even have an exhibit
about the divine name.

00:42:23.882 --> 00:42:25.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do you suppose that is?

00:42:25.925 --> 00:42:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think there’s
so much emphasis on God’s name?

00:42:29.804 --> 00:42:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah loves his name,

00:42:33.016 --> 00:42:36.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he loves those who love his name.

00:42:36.811 --> 00:42:41.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something we discover
when we read Malachi chapter 3

00:42:43.652 --> 00:42:47.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Malachi chapter 3,

00:42:47.072 --> 00:42:50.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 16.

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:54.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:42:54.913 --> 00:42:59.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi 3:16:

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time those who fear Jehovah
spoke with one another,

00:43:06.925 --> 00:43:09.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one with his companion,

00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:13.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Jehovah
kept paying attention and listening.

00:43:13.098 --> 00:43:15.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And a book of remembrance was written

00:43:15.684 --> 00:43:18.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before him for those fearing Jehovah

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:22.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and notice this] and for those

00:43:22.524 --> 00:43:25.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditating on his name.”

00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:28.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, in chapter 4 and verse 2,

00:43:28.614 --> 00:43:33.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah praises those “who honor [His] name.”

00:43:33.202 --> 00:43:35.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go back to this expression

00:43:35.537 --> 00:43:38.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those meditating on his name.”

00:43:38.499 --> 00:43:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think that means?

00:43:40.668 --> 00:43:44.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely it means more than
just accepting that God has a name.

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that.

00:43:47.132 --> 00:43:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Jews in Malachi’s day,

00:43:49.385 --> 00:43:52.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the unfaithful ones, knew that.

00:43:52.388 --> 00:43:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But surely it means meditating
on the meaning of God’s name

00:43:57.393 --> 00:43:59.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on the role

00:43:59.645 --> 00:44:03.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can have in vindicating his name.

00:44:03.858 --> 00:44:08.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know, many scholars
believe that Jehovah’s name

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:11.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “He Causes to Become.”

00:44:11.616 --> 00:44:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can become
whatever he needs to become,

00:44:15.703 --> 00:44:20.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can make you become
whatever he needs you to be.

00:44:20.458 --> 00:44:24.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days of Israel,
what did Jehovah need?

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often he needed prophets.

00:44:26.506 --> 00:44:28.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did he get them?

00:44:28.633 --> 00:44:30.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From ordinary people.

00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took a very shy young man named Jeremiah

00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:36.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turned him
into a bold and courageous prophet.

00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did the same with a farmer named Amos.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t tell Jehovah what you can and can’t do.

00:44:46.025 --> 00:44:50.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be surprised
about what you can do

00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:53.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just put yourself in Jehovah’s hands.

00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:57.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many in this audience once said:

00:44:57.579 --> 00:45:01.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never preach from door to door,”

00:45:01.082 --> 00:45:06.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never pioneer,”
“I could never be a missionary,”

00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:10.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never serve
where the need is great”?

00:45:10.216 --> 00:45:13.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah knew better.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:18.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can trust Jehovah
and what he promises to do.

00:45:18.308 --> 00:45:20.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will always keep his promises.

00:45:20.644 --> 00:45:22.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you
go through the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:45:22.646 --> 00:45:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you find certain expressions
over and over again.

00:45:25.982 --> 00:45:28.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Jews rebel against Jehovah.

00:45:28.151 --> 00:45:31.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do terrible things,
sometimes disgusting things.

00:45:31.446 --> 00:45:34.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you, the reader, are saying:

00:45:34.407 --> 00:45:37.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah, you really
ought to annihilate these people.

00:45:37.536 --> 00:45:39.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s terrible what they’re doing.’

00:45:39.746 --> 00:45:43.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then Jehovah reconsiders.

00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:45.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:45:45.419 --> 00:45:49.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For the sake of my promise
that I made to Abraham,’

00:45:49.339 --> 00:45:53.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for the sake of the covenant
that [I] made with [my servant] David,’

00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:56.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘for the sake of my name’”

00:45:56.763 --> 00:46:01.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to Jehovah, a promise is a promise.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promised Abraham and David

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he wouldn’t forsake their offspring.

00:46:07.816 --> 00:46:09.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he meant what he said.

00:46:09.818 --> 00:46:12.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think what that means.

00:46:12.154 --> 00:46:16.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing will make
Jehovah go back on his word.

00:46:16.283 --> 00:46:18.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah promises
that he’s going to take this earth

00:46:18.952 --> 00:46:22.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn it into a paradise,
you can take that to the bank.

00:46:22.539 --> 00:46:26.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will keep his promise.

00:46:26.585 --> 00:46:30.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how has Jehovah shown
that a promise is a promise

00:46:30.172 --> 00:46:32.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this convention?

00:46:32.174 --> 00:46:34.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he promise?

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My servants will eat.”

00:46:37.805 --> 00:46:41.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Governing Body
had to find a way to serve the food.

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:43.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided the food.

00:46:43.853 --> 00:46:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He provided it in abundance.

00:46:46.022 --> 00:46:48.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank him for it.

00:46:48.149 --> 00:46:53.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All praise goes to Jehovah
for this convention program.

00:46:53.154 --> 00:46:56.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we first discovered
that God has a name,

00:46:56.741 --> 00:46:59.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a turning point for many of us.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A circuit overseer was going
from door to door one morning,

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at one door,
a teenage boy answered.

00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:09.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He announced
that his parents were not at home,

00:47:09.128 --> 00:47:11.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the circuit overseer said,

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, just before I leave
I’d like to show you something.”

00:47:14.842 --> 00:47:18.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he showed the boy Jehovah’s name

00:47:18.137 --> 00:47:21.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible—Psalm 83:18.

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:25.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boy took the Bible to have a closer look,

00:47:25.186 --> 00:47:28.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turned around, went into the house,

00:47:28.356 --> 00:47:33.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shut the door
—with the circuit overseer’s Bible.

00:47:33.361 --> 00:47:38.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circuit overseer waited and waited,

00:47:38.241 --> 00:47:40.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he thought he’d lost his Bible.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:44.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then the boy’s mother
came to the door,

00:47:44.456 --> 00:47:47.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she apologized for pretending
that she wasn’t home.

00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:50.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she said she had been astonished

00:47:50.211 --> 00:47:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn that God has a name.

00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:56.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led to a good witness.

00:47:56.259 --> 00:47:59.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what else
do we know about God’s name?

00:47:59.929 --> 00:48:04.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that “the name
of Jehovah is a strong tower.”

00:48:04.935 --> 00:48:08.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to be able
to count on Jehovah

00:48:08.772 --> 00:48:12.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the attack of Gog of Magog.

00:48:12.234 --> 00:48:17.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Gog attacks,
Jehovah is going to vindicate himself

00:48:17.239 --> 00:48:22.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—He is going to protect His people
for the sake of His name.

00:48:22.202 --> 00:48:26.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s another reason
for us to love Jehovah’s name

00:48:26.123 --> 00:48:28.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to rejoice in his name.

00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:33.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because his name is involved,
Jehovah is going to protect his people.

00:48:33.338 --> 00:48:36.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we talk
about the attack of Gog and Magog,

00:48:36.925 --> 00:48:38.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it make you kind of nervous?

00:48:38.927 --> 00:48:41.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are a couple of things to think about.

00:48:41.638 --> 00:48:43.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose idea is it
for Gog to attack when he does?

00:48:47.936 --> 00:48:49.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out.

00:48:49.938 --> 00:48:52.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel chapter 38

00:48:57.863 --> 00:49:00.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we’re going to start with verse 4),

00:49:00.908 --> 00:49:04.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 38 beginning with verse 4.

00:49:04.203 --> 00:49:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is Jehovah talking

00:49:06.747 --> 00:49:09.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to that coalition of nations

00:49:09.416 --> 00:49:12.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known collectively as Gog.

00:49:12.586 --> 00:49:15.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want you to pay particular attention

00:49:15.297 --> 00:49:18.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the first part of the verse,
that’s verse 4.

00:49:18.759 --> 00:49:21.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says to Gog:

00:49:21.345 --> 00:49:25.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will turn you around

00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:29.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and put hooks in your jaws

00:49:29.937 --> 00:49:34.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring you out with all your army.”

00:49:34.942 --> 00:49:37.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about that.

00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:40.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will turn you around.”

00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:44.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like Gog
was headed in the opposite direction,

00:49:44.493 --> 00:49:46.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then Jehovah turns him around,

00:49:46.704 --> 00:49:49.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He draws him out to attack.

00:49:49.749 --> 00:49:51.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does that tell you?

00:49:51.876 --> 00:49:56.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The timing of the attack is Jehovah’s.

00:49:56.005 --> 00:49:58.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that doesn’t mean that Gog of Magog

00:49:58.674 --> 00:50:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had no intention of attacking God’s people.

00:50:00.843 --> 00:50:04.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was planning to attack at some point.

00:50:04.097 --> 00:50:07.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s the timing
of the attack that’s Jehovah’s.

00:50:07.892 --> 00:50:11.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Pure Worship</i> book
explains it this way—it says:

00:50:11.062 --> 00:50:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As if putting hooks
in Gog’s jaws and leading him along . . .

00:50:16.025 --> 00:50:19.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At some point following the destruction
of Babylon the Great,

00:50:19.821 --> 00:50:23.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah may in some way lure the nations

00:50:23.366 --> 00:50:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into carrying out
what is already in their hearts.

00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:31.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will thus set the stage

00:50:31.166 --> 00:50:34.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the attack that leads to Armageddon.”

00:50:34.085 --> 00:50:37.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are we worried about?

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:41.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is happening
according to Jehovah’s purpose.

00:50:41.635 --> 00:50:45.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we read verses 10-12,

00:50:45.513 --> 00:50:49.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see what Gog has in mind.

00:50:49.017 --> 00:50:53.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 38:10-12,

00:50:53.438 --> 00:50:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then leave your Bibles open,
because we’ll read one more verse.

00:50:57.818 --> 00:51:00.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 10 to 12, it says:

00:51:00.445 --> 00:51:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is what
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:51:03.532 --> 00:51:08.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“In that day thoughts
will come into your heart

00:51:08.036 --> 00:51:10.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“[I wonder who put them there?],

00:51:10.664 --> 00:51:13.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“and you will devise an evil plan.

00:51:13.875 --> 00:51:18.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You I will say: ‘I will invade the land
of unprotected settlements.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“‘I will come against
those living in security,

00:51:21.216 --> 00:51:24.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“‘without disturbance,
all of them living in settlements

00:51:24.344 --> 00:51:28.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.’

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:32.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be to take much spoil and plunder.”’”

00:51:32.561 --> 00:51:35.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will it all work out?

00:51:35.647 --> 00:51:38.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 23:

00:51:38.025 --> 00:51:41.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I [that is, Jehovah, I]

00:51:41.236 --> 00:51:45.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will certainly magnify myself
and sanctify myself

00:51:45.824 --> 00:51:49.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and make myself known
before the eyes of many nations

00:51:49.662 --> 00:51:54.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will have to know
that I am Jehovah.”

00:51:54.541 --> 00:51:56.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we learn?

00:51:56.585 --> 00:52:00.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is under control.

00:52:00.214 --> 00:52:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no need to panic.

00:52:02.258 --> 00:52:05.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is going according to schedule

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s schedule.

00:52:08.889 --> 00:52:11.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first thing.

00:52:11.475 --> 00:52:13.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is another thing.

00:52:13.561 --> 00:52:16.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What precedes the attack of Gog and Magog?

00:52:16.814 --> 00:52:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we read in the <i>Pure Worship</i> book?

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:23.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The destruction of Babylon the Great.

00:52:23.112 --> 00:52:25.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, have you ever considered

00:52:25.197 --> 00:52:28.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how that destruction
is going to fortify your faith

00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—is going to strengthen you—

00:52:30.786 --> 00:52:34.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you’re able
to endure the attack of Gog of Magog?

00:52:34.373 --> 00:52:36.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it this way:

00:52:36.584 --> 00:52:40.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What other religious organization

00:52:40.046 --> 00:52:45.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foretells the destruction
of a world empire of false religion?

00:52:45.051 --> 00:52:47.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re the only ones,

00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:49.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the others
are all part of Babylon the Great.

00:52:49.514 --> 00:52:53.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not going to foretell
their destruction in the future.

00:52:53.101 --> 00:52:55.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the destruction is going to be a surprise

00:52:55.937 --> 00:52:58.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everyone but Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it occurs,
there’ll be no doubt in your mind

00:53:02.735 --> 00:53:06.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re on the winning side
—that you’re on Jehovah’s side.

00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:11.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some brothers get all upset
over some detail

00:53:11.161 --> 00:53:14.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t think the organization
has the right take on.

00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:17.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be the pronunciation of God’s name

00:53:17.208 --> 00:53:19.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the meaning of that name

00:53:19.419 --> 00:53:21.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the meaning
of a single verse in the Scriptures.

00:53:21.963 --> 00:53:23.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get all upset.

00:53:23.465 --> 00:53:25.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get obsessed over one detail,

00:53:25.884 --> 00:53:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it interferes with their worship.

00:53:29.804 --> 00:53:32.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Babylon the Great goes down,

00:53:32.724 --> 00:53:36.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will there be any doubt as to which channel

00:53:36.353 --> 00:53:40.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God has been using
all this time to do his will?

00:53:40.065 --> 00:53:44.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be so glad
that you’re on the winning side.

00:53:44.986 --> 00:53:48.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it is sobering to think

00:53:48.532 --> 00:53:52.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the final attack
of Gog of Magog on God’s people.

00:53:52.994 --> 00:53:55.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it shouldn’t take away our joy.

00:53:55.539 --> 00:53:59.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah 8:10, it says:

00:53:59.626 --> 00:54:04.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:54:04.172 --> 00:54:08.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy is actually a protection for us.

00:54:08.552 --> 00:54:11.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Nehemiah need a stronghold?

00:54:11.972 --> 00:54:14.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the answer to that.

00:54:14.141 --> 00:54:17.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His life was being threatened.

00:54:17.144 --> 00:54:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pagan inhabitants of the land
wanted to kill him,

00:54:21.064 --> 00:54:23.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then there were problems
in the congregation.

00:54:23.984 --> 00:54:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the elders weren’t respecting
Jehovah’s law on marriage,

00:54:27.696 --> 00:54:29.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Sabbath wasn’t being observed.

00:54:29.948 --> 00:54:31.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was one of the reasons

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why the Jews went into captivity
in the first place.

00:54:34.411 --> 00:54:36.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were problems.

00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:41.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Nehemiah didn’t allow
those problems to rob him of his joy.

00:54:41.126 --> 00:54:43.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can be joyful

00:54:43.838 --> 00:54:46.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when we’re under a lot of pressure.

00:54:46.757 --> 00:54:51.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our joy doesn’t depend on our circumstances.

00:54:51.762 --> 00:54:56.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy helped Jesus to endure a torture stake.

00:54:56.642 --> 00:55:00.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy motivated the apostles to keep preaching

00:55:00.396 --> 00:55:02.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even after they’d been beaten.

00:55:02.857 --> 00:55:05.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “joy of Jehovah” can help you

00:55:05.609 --> 00:55:08.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep preaching in spite of indifference,

00:55:08.446 --> 00:55:12.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution, or any other obstacle.

00:55:12.116 --> 00:55:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe you feel:
‘Well, that’s what I need.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:18.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need more joy.’

00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:22.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, joy is an aspect
of the fruitage of the spirit.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you need more joy,
what do you do?

00:55:25.254 --> 00:55:28.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you get more of Jehovah’s spirit?

00:55:28.508 --> 00:55:33.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You ask for it: “Father, give me more joy.

00:55:33.054 --> 00:55:35.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to be joyful in my service.

00:55:35.682 --> 00:55:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to rejoice in you.”

00:55:40.436 --> 00:55:45.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning of this talk,
we read Psalm 37:4,

00:55:45.024 --> 00:55:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we focused particularly
on the first part of the verse,

00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:53.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rejoicing in Jehovah.

00:55:53.533 --> 00:55:56.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to the second part
of the verse now,

00:55:56.202 --> 00:55:59.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:4,

00:55:59.164 --> 00:56:04.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus on that part for just a moment.

00:56:04.169 --> 00:56:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Psalm 37:4, the first part says:

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then] and he will grant you

00:56:14.846 --> 00:56:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the desires of your heart.”

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:22.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does your heart desire?

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:26.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you
looking forward to in the new world?

00:56:26.024 --> 00:56:28.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it owning your own home?

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:32.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some countries,
it may be just having enough food to eat.

00:56:32.864 --> 00:56:36.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you looking forward to doing work
that you really enjoy?

00:56:36.785 --> 00:56:39.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or learning how to do something really well?

00:56:39.913 --> 00:56:42.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re older now,

00:56:42.249 --> 00:56:46.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re looking forward
to waking up every morning without pain

00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:50.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and without wondering,
‘I wonder what this pain means;

00:56:50.257 --> 00:56:52.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wonder if I have something serious’

00:56:52.843 --> 00:56:57.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never, ever having to think
about death again.

00:56:57.848 --> 00:57:01.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you looking forward
to conducting a Bible study

00:57:01.018 --> 00:57:03.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an unbelieving relative who returns

00:57:03.729 --> 00:57:07.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe with some historical figure?

00:57:07.733 --> 00:57:11.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This weekend we learned
that even faithful men of old

00:57:11.612 --> 00:57:14.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to have to adapt
to a different way of life

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn how to worship Jehovah in a way

00:57:17.242 --> 00:57:21.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be acceptable to him then.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, Abraham,

00:57:23.832 --> 00:57:28.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that child does not need to be circumcised.”

00:57:28.671 --> 00:57:32.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“David, you’re not a king anymore.

00:57:32.424 --> 00:57:37.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want a glass of water,
you’ll have to get up and get it yourself.”

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:42.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Samuel, I know you’re grateful
to be resurrected,

00:57:42.351 --> 00:57:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we don’t
offer animal sacrifices anymore.

00:57:45.855 --> 00:57:48.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So please, put that knife down

00:57:48.816 --> 00:57:52.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leave that bull alone.”

00:57:52.236 --> 00:57:56.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are going to be adjustments
that have to be made.

00:57:56.866 --> 00:57:58.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about living conditions?

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would you prefer
to live in the new world?

00:58:01.704 --> 00:58:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you love the country,

00:58:03.706 --> 00:58:06.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you’re assigned
to live in the country, you’d be very happy.

00:58:06.626 --> 00:58:10.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But suppose you love the country,
but you’re assigned to live in a city?

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:12.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can learn to love the city.

00:58:12.965 --> 00:58:15.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can help you to become

00:58:15.676 --> 00:58:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever you need to become.

00:58:19.055 --> 00:58:23.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you’re given to do
in the new world is going to be a blessing.

00:58:23.017 --> 00:58:26.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives ‘good gifts

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perfect presents’ to his servants.

00:58:29.274 --> 00:58:32.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jehovah is going to make arrangements

00:58:32.151 --> 00:58:36.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are going to be
for the ultimate good of all mankind.

00:58:36.239 --> 00:58:38.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t know
what arrangements will be made

00:58:38.241 --> 00:58:41.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to clean up the earth
just after the great tribulation,

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:43.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we do know there’ll be work to do.

00:58:43.413 --> 00:58:48.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may have the privilege
of sharing in that.

00:58:48.418 --> 00:58:51.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think how you’ll feel

00:58:51.046 --> 00:58:54.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you begin to move closer to perfection

00:58:54.382 --> 00:58:57.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both in mind and in body.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:01.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, David’s words
recorded at Psalm 139:14

00:59:01.806 --> 00:59:03.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to take on greater meaning.

00:59:03.808 --> 00:59:06.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the last verse
we’re going to read during this convention.

00:59:06.561 --> 00:59:08.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to follow along

00:59:08.563 --> 00:59:11.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 139,

00:59:11.733 --> 00:59:14.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 14.

00:59:14.986 --> 00:59:19.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this is imperfect David writing.

00:59:19.866 --> 00:59:22.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 139:14:

00:59:22.577 --> 00:59:27.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way

00:59:27.582 --> 00:59:30.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am wonderfully made.

00:59:30.002 --> 00:59:32.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your works are wonderful,

00:59:32.546 --> 00:59:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know this very well.”

00:59:35.591 --> 00:59:38.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was impressed

00:59:38.844 --> 00:59:42.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the way his imperfect body functioned.

00:59:42.222 --> 00:59:45.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how he’ll feel
when he’s perfect?

00:59:45.225 --> 00:59:49.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll probably write another song.

00:59:49.104 --> 00:59:54.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we
sum up this heart-stirring convention?

00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:57.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best way I can think of is for you

00:59:57.571 --> 01:00:00.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy one final video

01:00:00.532 --> 01:00:04.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlighting the reasons
for joy now and for the future.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, enjoy the video,

01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:10.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but pay attention to the music
because we’re going to be singing

01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:13.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that original song
at the end of this program.

01:00:13.045 --> 01:00:15.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want everyone to sing.

01:00:15.548 --> 01:00:18.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone must sing

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:22.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no just moving the lips, no faking.

01:00:22.054 --> 01:00:25.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sing, but enjoy the video as well.

01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:47.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars that fill the summer night
Look down from above.

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beauty of the day and night
You fashioned with love.

01:00:54.170 --> 01:01:01.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your hands prepared the land and sea,
And ev’rything that came to be

01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:05.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brought joy to your heart.

01:01:07.725 --> 01:01:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:01:15.024 --> 01:01:21.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:01:21.781 --> 01:01:28.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:01:28.788 --> 01:01:41.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:01:57.192 --> 01:02:04.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, we have all we need
To bring us delight—

01:02:04.908 --> 01:02:11.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things we hear and touch and see
And feel deep inside.

01:02:11.456 --> 01:02:18.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You gave us such a perfect start,
Eternity in ev’ry heart,

01:02:18.547 --> 01:02:23.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And joy in our lives.

01:02:25.053 --> 01:02:32.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:02:39.026 --> 01:02:46.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:57.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This joy could not be ours
Without the gift of your Son.

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:25.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His sacrifice has paid the price
So joy could be ours for all time.

01:03:25.364 --> 01:03:31.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:03:31.787 --> 01:03:38.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:03:38.294 --> 01:03:45.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:03:45.802 --> 01:03:59.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:06.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:04:06.406 --> 01:04:12.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:04:12.704 --> 01:04:19.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:04:19.919 --> 01:04:32.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:04:39.648 --> 01:04:44.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that touching video,
what more is there to say?

01:04:44.111 --> 01:04:47.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find your greatest joy” in Jehovah.

01:04:47.656 --> 01:04:49.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rejoice!

01:04:49.658 --> 01:04:52.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our deliverance is near.

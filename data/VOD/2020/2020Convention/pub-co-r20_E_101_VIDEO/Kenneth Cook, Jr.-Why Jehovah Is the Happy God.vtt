Welcome to the 2020 “Always Rejoice”!

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regional Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the start, we wish to convey to you

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greetings from the Governing Body
and the entire Bethel family.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:23.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want you to know that we love you,
and we keep you in our prayers.

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, whether you are watching
this from home or from some other location,

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is our convention for 2020.

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what an encouraging theme,
“Always Rejoice”!

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to discuss this subject

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now more than ever before, don’t we?

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to rejoice
as the world crumbles around us?

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who love Jehovah
can always find reasons to rejoice.

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout this convention,
we will discuss

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four things
that will help us to rejoice.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they?

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) We will consider
the reasons we have for rejoicing,

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:09.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we will examine
how we can cultivate godly joy,

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) we will look at how we
can maintain joy despite trials,

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (4) we will discuss
how to express joy,

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, the joy we receive
from serving Jehovah.

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s lay the foundation
for all of this

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by first answering the question:

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is true joy?

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is commonly called joy

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an emotion that is stirred
by a feeling of well-being,

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a sense of success,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or because of expecting
something good.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for this reason,
joy may seem to come and go

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depending on what
is happening around us.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might call it circumstantial joy.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not the case with true joy.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because true joy
—godly joy—

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an aspect of the fruitage
of God’s holy spirit.

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True joy is a quality of the heart

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is not dependent on external things
happening around us.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:15.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This godly quality comes
from knowing that you have the truth,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are doing what pleases God,

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that your Kingdom hope
is certain to be fulfilled.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, we see
there’s a big difference

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between having circumstantial joy

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having “joy of holy spirit.”

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is illustrated for us in the Scriptures

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the example
of the Christians in Thessalonica.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul and others
helped them to prepare ahead of time

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face persecution with joy,

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare they did.

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:50.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became strong in faith.

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read
about what this did for them

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 1:6.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read the verse, ask yourself,

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where did their deep-seated joy come from?’

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse reads:

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you became imitators of us,
and of the Lord,

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:13.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“seeing that you accepted
the word under much tribulation

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with joy of holy spirit.”

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:19.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did their joy come from?

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:23.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things are mentioned:
They imitated good examples,

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:28.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had the joy that comes
from having God’s holy spirit on them.

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can acquire
“joy of holy spirit,” as mentioned here,

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:36.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by applying what we learn

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:39.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeking Jehovah’s blessing,
his spirit.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is not a mere personality trait

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:45.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are born with then, is it?

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it doesn’t come to us
simply because of pleasant circumstances.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Joy of holy spirit”
is found deep within us.

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it should not be confused
with simply being cheerful or exuberant.

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is not superficial.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not found
in constantly smiling or laughing.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To show the difference,
think of a comedian

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:13.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who seems to be able
to find what is funny

00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just about any situation in life.

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:21.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, deep down inside,
he may be very unhappy.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:25.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, like the Christians
in Thessalonica,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can have “joy of holy spirit”

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:30.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when we
are under tribulation.

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:33.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not smile
through a bad time,

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:38.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our deep inner joy
in serving Jehovah is immovable.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of “the new personality”

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that true Christians put on
in order to be like Christ.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:49.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with this basic understanding
of godly joy in mind,

00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:52.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s give our attention
to Brother Stephen Lett,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
as he welcomes us

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this “Always Rejoice”! convention.

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:04.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please listen carefully
as he explains why godly joy

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is such a special quality.

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the “Always Rejoice”!

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:20.465 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re so happy
that you were able to arrange

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:22.718 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attend all three days

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:24.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of this convention.

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:27.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were the apostle Paul’s words

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:4 chosen

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, over the past four years,

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:40.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
has used conventions

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:43.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to highlight qualities

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:46.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that endear us to Jehovah

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us to be victorious

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:54.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our struggle
against Satan and his world.

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had convention themes
that focused on the need

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:01.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for loyalty,

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endurance,

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:07.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
courage,

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:10.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love.

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:11.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year,

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:15.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the convention theme highlights
the need for joy.

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Nehemiah 8:10,

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:20.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told:

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:25.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the near future,

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:32.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith will be tested
as never before.

00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:37.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we acquire true joy
with the help of God’s holy spirit,

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:39.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to stand firm

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:44.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weather all the storms
that come our way.

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:50.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is a deep-seated quality
of the heart.

00:06:50.472 --> 00:06:54.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a state of happiness that remains

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether the conditions
around us are pleasant or not.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:03.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, a person
can be disturbed about something

00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:07.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still have joy in his heart.

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:12.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the apostles were flogged

00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:14.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for speaking about the Christ.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:17.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, “they went out
from before the Sanhedrin,

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:21.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rejoicing because they
had been counted worthy

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:25.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be dishonored in behalf of his name.”

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:31.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, they weren’t rejoicing
over the flogging they had received.

00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:33.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as servants of God,

00:07:33.807 --> 00:07:36.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found true joy

00:07:36.018 --> 00:07:40.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping their integrity to him.

00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:45.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, is it possible for a Christian

00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:48.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always to be rejoicing?

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:53.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because true joy is an aspect

00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:56.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.

00:07:56.913 --> 00:07:58.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an inward quality,

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:02.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joy is not dependent on external things,

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even on our brothers.

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:09.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does depend on God’s spirit.

00:08:09.885 --> 00:08:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as already noted,

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:16.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy comes
from that deep inner satisfaction

00:08:16.683 --> 00:08:19.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of knowing that we have the truth,

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:22.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re doing what pleases Jehovah,

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:27.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that our Kingdom hope is sure.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So godly joy is not the transient joy

00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people experience 
because they’ve secured a well-paying job,

00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gone on an exotic vacation,

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attained fame and prestige,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or acquired some
coveted material item

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:49.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or large sum of money.

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:54.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, true joy has to be cultivated

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:56.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of holy spirit.

00:08:56.515 --> 00:09:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To obtain Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:05.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to draw close to him
and give him exclusive devotion.

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:07.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 5:32,

00:09:07.401 --> 00:09:11.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told that God gives holy spirit

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:15.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those obeying him as ruler.”

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:19.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these three days,
the convention program

00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to deepen
our appreciation

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for godly joy.

00:09:25.627 --> 00:09:29.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn what true joy is,

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:31.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to cultivate it,

00:09:31.508 --> 00:09:35.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to maintain it during difficult times,

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:37.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to display it

00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:40.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it wells up in our hearts.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:44.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such joy will clearly identify us

00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:46.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as disciples of Jesus,

00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:50.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will enable us to serve

00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:53.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as beacons of light in this dark world

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:58.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw others to our “happy God.”

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:02.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll note
that nearly the entire second day

00:10:02.372 --> 00:10:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been devoted
to the joy of disciple-making.

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy will help us

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:13.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face challenges to our integrity.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that it was
“the joy that was set before him”

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:19.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped Jesus to face

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:22.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an excruciating death on a torture stake.

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:28.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please pay rapt attention
to the talks and videos.

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look up the scriptures,
and read them along with the speakers,

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus allowing God’s Word

00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:40.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to exert its powerful force
on your heart.

00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:44.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this convention
become a milestone

00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:46.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your development

00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:51.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a joyful imitator of our happy God.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we are
that he made us “in his image,”

00:10:57.344 --> 00:10:59.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving us the capacity

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:03.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel and express godly joy!

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:08.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how thankful we are
that he also gives us his holy spirit

00:11:08.772 --> 00:11:12.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us cultivate that kind of joy!

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:16.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much,

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:19.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray that each one of you

00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:22.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will forever respond to the words

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:26.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the psalmist at Psalm 100:2:

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:30.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:35.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come into his presence
with joyful shouting.”

00:11:38.385 --> 00:11:42.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wish to thank Brother Lett
for building up our anticipation

00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:45.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this “Always Rejoice”! convention.

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:47.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Lett highlighted,

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:51.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
godly joy is indeed a very special quality.

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:54.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such true joy
comes from Jehovah himself.

00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:58.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Bible
says that he always

00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:02.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has reasons to rejoice
—so much so

00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:06.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that being happy
describes his personality.

00:12:06.454 --> 00:12:08.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see this for ourselves

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:12.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read 1 Timothy 1:11.

00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:15.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The context in verses 8 through 10

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lists many of the bad qualities and actions

00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people of this world display.

00:12:21.177 --> 00:12:23.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they can change if they listen

00:12:23.847 --> 00:12:26.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our joyful God, Jehovah.

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that in mind,
note the apostle Paul’s inspired words

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:34.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 11,
as he goes on to say

00:12:34.316 --> 00:12:38.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the glorious good news
of the happy God,

00:12:38.778 --> 00:12:41.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with which I was entrusted.”

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:44.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can Jehovah be called happy

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:48.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite seeing all of the problems
and suffering on the earth?

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, among the many things
that make him happy are the following four.

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:56.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Jehovah is the Creator.

00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:59.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he does is perfect.

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:03.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:4 says:

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:05.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Perfect is his activity.”

00:13:05.513 --> 00:13:10.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, Jehovah
can rightly rejoice in his creation.

00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:13.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That fact is undeniable,
and it’s clearly stated

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:17.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Psalm 104:31.

00:13:17.317 --> 00:13:19.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read it together,

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:24.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how determined
Jehovah is to keep his joy.

00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:27.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 31 says:

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:30.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:13:30.622 --> 00:13:35.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:
Jehovah will not be denied, will he?

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:43.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will find joy
in what he has accomplished.

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:45.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can take that from him.

00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the happy God whose purpose for man

00:13:48.765 --> 00:13:51.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the earth will be realized.

00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:55.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adding to his happiness is reason (2)

00:13:55.313 --> 00:13:57.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is generous.

00:13:57.482 --> 00:14:01.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know what the Bible
says about those who give.

00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:05.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And aren’t we grateful
for all that Jehovah is providing

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us and support us
now through a very difficult time?

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) Jehovah’s heart is made glad

00:14:13.415 --> 00:14:16.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the faithfulness of his servants.

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:19.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never forgets all that we have done.

00:14:19.504 --> 00:14:22.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 23:15, he says:

00:14:22.924 --> 00:14:25.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If your heart becomes wise,

00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:28.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then my own heart will rejoice.”

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we remain faithful to Jehovah,

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:36.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy that we
can bring to him will last forever.

00:14:36.604 --> 00:14:41.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(4) Because Jehovah is perfect,

00:14:41.025 --> 00:14:43.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he always does what is right.

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:48.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will never do anything
to spoil his own happiness.

00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:51.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now that we have looked
at what makes Jehovah the happy God,

00:14:51.995 --> 00:14:54.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to know what makes us happy,

00:14:54.914 --> 00:14:57.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, what makes us truly happy

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:00.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—deep-down-inside happy.

00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:05.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, it’s not difficult
to find superficial happiness.

00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, when you’re near
someone with a funny laugh,

00:15:09.012 --> 00:15:12.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you often find yourself
laughing as well?

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:14.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It happens, right?

00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:17.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not even know
what you’re laughing about, true?

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is this:
It’s not all that difficult

00:15:21.483 --> 00:15:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to experience superficial happiness.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to find lasting joy takes effort,

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:32.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it takes appreciation
for what we have.

00:15:32.243 --> 00:15:36.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will now look at some
of the things that bring us real joy,

00:15:36.998 --> 00:15:41.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as you might expect,
it begins with Jehovah.

00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:44.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our relationship with Jehovah

00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:47.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our foremost reason for joy,

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:50.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not just any relationship;

00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:52.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take note of what is needed

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read Psalm 16:11.

00:15:57.602 --> 00:16:02.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we do so, first,
notice what Jehovah does.

00:16:02.106 --> 00:16:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, see what type of relationship
we can have with him.

00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:10.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, make the connection to having joy.

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:14.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 16:11 reads:

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You make known to me the path of life.

00:16:17.747 --> 00:16:22.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your presence is abundant joy.”

00:16:23.586 --> 00:16:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again, first, what does Jehovah do?

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kindly makes
“the path of life” known to us.

00:16:30.301 --> 00:16:34.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, what type of relationship
can we have with him?

00:16:34.681 --> 00:16:39.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A very close one, it says,
as if “in [his very] presence.”

00:16:39.644 --> 00:16:43.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we read that “in [his] presence,”
there is what?

00:16:43.648 --> 00:16:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abundant joy.”

00:16:46.442 --> 00:16:51.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, along with having
a close relationship with Jehovah,

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:55.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned there,
what else brings us joy?

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s holy spirit does.

00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His holy spirit generates joy
in those who receive it.

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:07.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, we should pray
to receive his holy spirit every day.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else promotes true joy within us?

00:17:10.008 --> 00:17:12.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our marvelous hope.

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:15.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we have
an abundance of spiritual food,

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under difficult circumstances.

00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That joyful blessing
was foretold in God’s Word.

00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:24.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see it, please go

00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:29.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Isaiah 65:13, 14.

00:17:29.611 --> 00:17:34.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in these verses,
Jehovah draws a contrast

00:17:34.115 --> 00:17:36.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between good people
and bad people

00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:39.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he says this,
starting in verse 13:

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore this is what
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Look!

00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:50.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will eat,
but you will go hungry.

00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:51.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will drink,
but you will go thirsty.

00:17:55.178 --> 00:17:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:17:56.804 --> 00:18:00.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will rejoice,
but you will suffer shame.

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:02.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:18:02.143 --> 00:18:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will shout joyfully
because of the good condition of the heart,

00:18:06.981 --> 00:18:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will cry out
because of the pain of heart.’”

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see yourself
on Jehovah’s side of this contrast?

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve been keeping up
with God’s organization,

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should feel well-fed spiritually.

00:18:24.123 --> 00:18:26.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bad conditions of this world

00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:29.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must not be permitted
to take away from our joy.

00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah said:
“[We] shout joyfully.”

00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:33.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:36.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of the good condition
of the heart.”

00:18:36.427 --> 00:18:39.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are more ready than ever before

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the realization of our hope.

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:46.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
the world around us is suffering

00:18:46.354 --> 00:18:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they lack clear direction

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:51.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are without real hope.

00:18:51.943 --> 00:18:56.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout our lives,
and especially at times like this,

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should take note
of Jehovah’s help.

00:18:59.742 --> 00:19:04.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see that Jehovah is helping us,
we know that he is with us.

00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:09.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just know it
—and this too brings us immense joy!

00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:14.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we find joy in hearing
the expressions of faith

00:19:14.257 --> 00:19:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come from our dear brothers
and sisters, don’t we?

00:19:18.052 --> 00:19:22.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is true whether we
meet together for worship in person

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whether we meet
by means of video.

00:19:25.393 --> 00:19:30.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, with so much
to add to our inner joy,

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:34.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can come to have a joy
so strong and so deep within us

00:19:34.527 --> 00:19:36.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nothing can shake it.

00:19:36.696 --> 00:19:38.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even persecution,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though not enjoyable in itself,
can lead to joy.

00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:44.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:19:44.537 --> 00:19:48.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said at Matthew 5:11, 12:

00:19:48.332 --> 00:19:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people reproach you

00:19:51.794 --> 00:19:54.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and persecute you and lyingly say

00:19:54.547 --> 00:19:57.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every sort of wicked thing
against you for my sake.

00:19:57.925 --> 00:20:00.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice and be overjoyed,

00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since your reward is great.”

00:20:03.139 --> 00:20:06.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we be joyful

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we are persecuted?

00:20:08.936 --> 00:20:12.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because when we endure persecution

00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:14.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with joy and keep our integrity,

00:20:14.942 --> 00:20:18.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we gain a victory and Jehovah’s approval.

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:21.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Rejoice and be overjoyed,

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:24.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since your reward is great.”

00:20:24.911 --> 00:20:28.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, so far, we have defined true joy,

00:20:28.164 --> 00:20:32.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have examined why Jehovah
is called “the happy God,”

00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:36.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have reviewed
a number of things that bring us godly joy.

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:39.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at this point, you may be wondering,

00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:43.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can I really be happy if I am suffering?’

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:45.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very good question.

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:48.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s look some more at how

00:20:48.184 --> 00:20:51.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in what sense we can “always rejoice.”

00:20:51.896 --> 00:20:56.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that at times all of us
may be saddened by injustice,

00:20:56.901 --> 00:21:00.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
poor health, unemployment, grief,

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other causes of anxiety

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as mankind has experienced
with this global pandemic.

00:21:08.037 --> 00:21:10.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of our brothers and sisters

00:21:10.581 --> 00:21:13.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been affected
by such things, haven’t they?

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:15.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since that is the case,

00:21:15.336 --> 00:21:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look at how we can apply
the words of our convention theme,

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:23.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:4.

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:28.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we read verse 4
—Philippians 4:4—

00:21:28.683 --> 00:21:31.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine the apostle Paul writing this

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:35.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while he was in prison bonds, or chains.

00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:37.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, full of faith,

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said this with God’s spirit on him:

00:21:40.653 --> 00:21:43.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always rejoice in the Lord.

00:21:43.447 --> 00:21:47.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again I will say, Rejoice!”

00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why could Paul say this so emphatically?

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the apostle Paul was a man

00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:57.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had true godly joy.

00:21:57.128 --> 00:22:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had true joy that was not dependent
on what was happening around him

00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:03.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what was happening to him.

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:07.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From a heart filled with faith,
he said that he had joy

00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:10.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was focused in,
or on, the Lord.

00:22:10.683 --> 00:22:13.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why Paul was joyful

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any injustice
or anxiety that he experienced.

00:22:17.899 --> 00:22:22.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always rejoice,”
he said, “again . . . rejoice.”

00:22:22.862 --> 00:22:26.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help us to apply
these inspired words?

00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Paul, we too can always rejoice,
despite unpleasant circumstances,

00:22:31.454 --> 00:22:35.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we grow in faith and seek true joy.

00:22:35.499 --> 00:22:39.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too seek joy that’s not merely
the result of what happens

00:22:39.503 --> 00:22:42.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around us or what happens to us.

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:46.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray earnestly for God’s spirit,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helps us to succeed

00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:53.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep our deep inner joy
no matter what trial we may face.

00:22:53.392 --> 00:22:55.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more than this,

00:22:55.728 --> 00:22:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have Jehovah’s example to imitate.

00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:03.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has maintained his joy
despite much heartache.

00:23:03.986 --> 00:23:06.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has he endured?

00:23:06.614 --> 00:23:10.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, over a period of about 4,000 years,

00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:15.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw a number of angels
rebel against his sovereignty.

00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:17.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw Adam and Eve rebel.

00:23:17.917 --> 00:23:20.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He watched wickedness
spread across the earth.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw false worship spread,

00:23:23.923 --> 00:23:27.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this included
what his chosen people, the Israelites,

00:23:27.218 --> 00:23:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did as they reverted again

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and again to apostasy.

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:36.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, Jehovah saw his enemies

00:23:36.727 --> 00:23:38.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put his Son to death.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through it all,
though unimaginably painful for Him,

00:23:42.858 --> 00:23:46.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never lost his deep-seated joy.

00:23:46.654 --> 00:23:49.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, imagine his joy

00:23:49.782 --> 00:23:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched the vast majority
of the angels keep their integrity.

00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:56.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine his joy

00:23:56.998 --> 00:24:00.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched
faithful Israelites keep their integrity

00:24:00.876 --> 00:24:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when faced with death.

00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:07.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And imagine Jehovah’s joy
as he saw thousands turn

00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:11.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to following his Son
and become true Christians

00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:16.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a number that today
reaches into the millions.

00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:18.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always been able

00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:22.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the light beyond the storm.

00:24:22.148 --> 00:24:27.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we imitate the happy God
and count our blessings every day,

00:24:27.194 --> 00:24:30.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even during the most difficult times.

00:24:30.823 --> 00:24:35.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us to do this, we have
an entire convention now to enjoy

00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:40.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of it centered
on the thought of always rejoicing.

00:24:40.124 --> 00:24:44.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention includes talks,
symposiums, interviews,

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:47.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Bible drama, and many videos

00:24:47.298 --> 00:24:50.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will teach us how to cultivate

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:53.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and display “joy of holy spirit.”

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:58.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please look at the convention program,
and let’s see what’s in store for us.

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:00.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Scriptural theme for the first day

00:25:00.978 --> 00:25:05.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also our convention theme scripture,
Philippians 4:4,

00:25:05.941 --> 00:25:09.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which again says:
“Always rejoice in the Lord.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again I will say, Rejoice!”

00:25:13.074 --> 00:25:16.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have so much to look forward to

00:25:16.243 --> 00:25:19.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the first day of this program.

00:25:19.121 --> 00:25:22.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
the opening symposium will show

00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:25.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s Jehovah’s advice,
not the world’s wisdom,

00:25:25.961 --> 00:25:28.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings true joy
when we follow it.

00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the dramatic Bible reading
will help us to visualize

00:25:32.802 --> 00:25:36.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the events recorded
in the book of Ezra.

00:25:36.097 --> 00:25:39.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, we will enjoy
a faith-strengthening review

00:25:39.683 --> 00:25:43.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how in the past
Jehovah saved his people

00:25:43.687 --> 00:25:47.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a group and as individuals.

00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:50.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this critical time,

00:25:50.736 --> 00:25:53.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important for us to take to heart

00:25:53.072 --> 00:25:56.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we will hear in that talk, entitled

00:25:56.283 --> 00:26:01.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in Jehovah’s Acts 
of Salvation.”

00:26:01.247 --> 00:26:05.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon session,
the second symposium of the day

00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:09.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will explain how the joy
in a family is enhanced

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:14.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when each member appreciates
and cherishes the others.

00:26:14.051 --> 00:26:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last symposium of the day

00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:19.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show how creation
provides convincing proof

00:26:19.807 --> 00:26:22.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:26:22.977 --> 00:26:26.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will be followed
by a talk that will discuss

00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:29.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we can find more peace and more joy

00:26:29.692 --> 00:26:33.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by avoiding jealousy and competition.

00:26:33.195 --> 00:26:36.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the first day concludes
with a talk that will show us

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:40.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how those who truly know
Jehovah are optimistic.

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:43.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are generous and patient.

00:26:43.581 --> 00:26:46.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As with each part of this convention,

00:26:46.292 --> 00:26:49.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listen carefully to this talk, entitled

00:26:49.879 --> 00:26:54.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close Friendship With Jehovah
Brings the Greatest Joy!”

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now look ahead to the second day
of our convention program.

00:26:59.388 --> 00:27:03.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptural theme
is based on Psalm 105:3,

00:27:03.976 --> 00:27:08.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there in verse 3, we are encouraged
to “boast about his holy name.

00:27:08.939 --> 00:27:13.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts of those
seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:17.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One important way
to “boast about [Jehovah’s] holy name”

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by means of our disciple-making work.

00:27:21.368 --> 00:27:24.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tying that in with our convention theme,

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first symposium of the day
will leave no doubt

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our joy increases as our skills

00:27:31.712 --> 00:27:34.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the disciple-making work improve.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following this, the second symposium

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show how we can find joy
in the ministry when we rely

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the help that God
gives us for this work.

00:27:44.725 --> 00:27:47.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The baptism talk

00:27:47.186 --> 00:27:50.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help those soon-to-get-baptized
to keep in mind

00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:53.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they need to do in order to be happy

00:27:53.984 --> 00:27:56.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and forever.

00:27:56.695 --> 00:27:59.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon portion
of the second day’s program,

00:27:59.698 --> 00:28:04.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will hear experiences during a series
of videos that will make you proud

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be part of our international brotherhood

00:28:07.498 --> 00:28:10.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of disciple-makers.

00:28:10.042 --> 00:28:12.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last symposium of day two

00:28:12.836 --> 00:28:15.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will focus on ways you can help
your Bible students

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:17.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome their fears

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:21.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience Jehovah’s help
and his blessings.

00:28:21.387 --> 00:28:24.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will be followed
by a convention highlight

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Part I of the Bible drama

00:28:27.184 --> 00:28:31.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.”</i>

00:28:31.397 --> 00:28:34.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that faith-strengthening drama,

00:28:34.191 --> 00:28:38.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will enjoy the final talk
of the second day, entitled

00:28:38.571 --> 00:28:43.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Making Disciples Now Prepares Us
for New World Disciple-Making.”

00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:47.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This talk will help
to increase our enthusiasm

00:28:47.621 --> 00:28:50.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for the disciple-making
work of today

00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for that yet to come.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we go to the final day
of our program.

00:28:58.007 --> 00:29:02.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a Scriptural theme
taken from Psalm 37:4,

00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final day focuses our attention

00:29:05.014 --> 00:29:09.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what lies at the heart of true joy.

00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:11.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:4 says:

00:29:11.353 --> 00:29:14.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:18.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:29:18.736 --> 00:29:21.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah as our focus,

00:29:21.697 --> 00:29:25.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we start the day
with a seven-part symposium

00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:29.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will highlight how we
can endure trials with joy.

00:29:29.663 --> 00:29:33.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward,
during the public Bible discourse,

00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:37.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the speaker will explain
what riches God promises

00:29:37.463 --> 00:29:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they can be obtained.

00:29:40.924 --> 00:29:44.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the concluding session of our convention,

00:29:44.303 --> 00:29:48.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be delighted to watch
the thrilling climax of the Bible drama

00:29:48.724 --> 00:29:52.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.”</i>

00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the convention program
will conclude with the talk

00:29:56.732 --> 00:30:00.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find Exquisite Delight in Jehovah!”

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will all benefit

00:30:02.738 --> 00:30:05.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the speaker reviews
what helps us now

00:30:05.824 --> 00:30:10.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we have
to look forward to in the future.

00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:13.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see a preview

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the many videos
we will enjoy at this convention?

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:19.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought so.
Let’s watch.

00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:25.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to look for work,
but I was unsuccessful.

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:30:29.098 --> 00:30:31.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the specialist gave us the diagnosis

00:30:31.141 --> 00:30:34.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a very aggressive brain tumor.

00:30:34.395 --> 00:30:36.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My negative disposition

00:30:36.772 --> 00:30:41.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a very impatient, sarcastic,
and demanding person.

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:45.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I was not appointed
as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:30:45.656 --> 00:30:48.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:51.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling all his promises.

00:30:51.286 --> 00:30:54.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I’m happy to endure.

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:57.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when everything
around you is chaotic,

00:30:57.835 --> 00:31:01.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:31:03.006 --> 00:31:07.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regaining joy is a work in progress.

00:31:07.177 --> 00:31:11.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always admired
the beauty and power of the sea.

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:15.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of the One
who created the sea.

00:31:15.102 --> 00:31:17.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not hard for him to care

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:19.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for just one small human like me.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful preview!

00:31:26.613 --> 00:31:28.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have so many blessings

00:31:28.615 --> 00:31:31.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate
and to draw strength from.

00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, enjoy the blessings

00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:37.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cultivating “joy of holy spirit.”

00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:39.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From this opening discussion,

00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:43.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s clear that godly joy
does not come from random events;

00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor does it come from this world.

00:31:46.008 --> 00:31:49.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, godly joy
—true joy—

00:31:49.344 --> 00:31:53.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an aspect of the fruitage
of God’s holy spirit.

00:31:53.682 --> 00:31:57.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will be one of the many blessings
that we will experience

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continue to rejoice?

00:31:59.563 --> 00:32:02.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer,
which this convention will highlight,

00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:06.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at 2 Corinthians 13:11.

00:32:06.987 --> 00:32:09.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read it along with me

00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:13.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 13:11.

00:32:13.327 --> 00:32:18.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Finally, brothers,
continue to rejoice,

00:32:18.332 --> 00:32:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be readjusted, to be comforted,
to think in agreement,

00:32:23.045 --> 00:32:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to live peaceably;

00:32:25.214 --> 00:32:29.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the God of love and of peace
will be with you.”

00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:32.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you continue to rejoice

00:32:32.805 --> 00:32:35.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in serving Jehovah,
what is the promise?

00:32:35.682 --> 00:32:40.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The promise is that “the God of love
and of peace will be with you.”

00:32:40.687 --> 00:32:42.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that in mind,

00:32:42.689 --> 00:32:46.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s be determined
to “always rejoice.”

00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:48.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, Jehovah,

00:32:48.153 --> 00:32:51.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the happy God,”
will always be with us.

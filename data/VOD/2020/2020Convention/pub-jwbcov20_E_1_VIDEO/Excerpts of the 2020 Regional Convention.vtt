I tried to look for work,
but I was unsuccessful.

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the specialist gave us the diagnosis

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a very aggressive brain tumor.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My negative disposition

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a very impatient, sarcastic,
and demanding person.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I was not appointed
as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling all his promises.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I’m happy to endure.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when everything
around you is chaotic,

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regaining joy is a work in progress.

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:52.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always admired
the beauty and power of the sea.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of the One
who created the sea.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not hard for him to care

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for just one small human like me.

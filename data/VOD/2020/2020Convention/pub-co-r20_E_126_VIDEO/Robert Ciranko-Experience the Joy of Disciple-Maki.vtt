What would you say?

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:07.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important is the disciple-making work?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it is so important
that Jehovah God is directly involved in it.

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn in your Bibles, please,
to 1 Corinthians 3:9

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:21.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 3:9.

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:25.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “For we are God’s fellow workers.

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:29.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are God’s field under cultivation,
God’s building.”

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think what a privilege we have to share

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the almighty Creator of the universe

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the work that he considers
so important here on earth.

00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:42.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allows us to experience the joy

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:46.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of helping to build people
into disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:51.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know from the verses
that come just before verse 9,

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:54.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that while we plant
and water seeds of Kingdom truth

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the hearts of interested ones,

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the one
who makes those seeds grow.

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:03.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, knowing this
should not minimize in our minds

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the importance of our part
in the disciple-making work.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we do and how we do it has an impact

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:13.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how those seeds of truth will grow.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:18.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows that the more skilled
we become at making disciples,

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:21.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more effective
we will be as his fellow workers,

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:25.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the more enjoyable
the work will be for us.

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To that end, Jehovah equips
us to teach as effectively as possible.

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:32.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we have to do is accept his help.

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:35.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what this symposium is all about:

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning to benefit
from the research tools Jehovah has given us,

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that is available
from our brothers, and the power of prayer.

00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:48.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each talk in this symposium
will consider two questions.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, what help has Jehovah given us?

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, how can we use that help

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to increase our joy in the ministry?

00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:02.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by talking about research tools.

00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:05.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What help has Jehovah given us?

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:10.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has given us the right tools
—the best tools—for our work.

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:13.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Foremost of all,
he has dignified us by allowing us

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:16.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use his written Word, the Bible,

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:19.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is our most important tool
for the ministry.

00:02:20.418 --> 00:02:25.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to 2 Timothy 3:16, 17

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Timothy 3:16, 17.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:32.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All Scripture is inspired of God

00:02:32.556 --> 00:02:36.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:02:36.644 --> 00:02:40.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for setting things straight,
for disciplining in righteousness,

00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that the man of God
[or woman of God] may be fully competent,

00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:48.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:54.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should want to do all
we can to keep honing our skills

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:58.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and using the Bible to teach the truth
about God, Christ, and the Kingdom.

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:02.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the beauty of using
the Bible is that the message

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:07.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contained in it can literally change people.

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Religious falsehoods and erroneous ideas

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have become “strongly entrenched”
in the minds of sincere people.

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible, when used effectively,

00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can overturn those wrong beliefs.

00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:22.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, the Bible
can even help a person understand

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own deepest thoughts and feelings.

00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:29.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible translation
renders that 16th verse by saying:

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:34.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Bible is useful for resetting
the direction of a man’s life.”

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through our own study of the Bible,

00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:42.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can become skilled
at using the Scriptures in the ministry.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to help us succeed in this, Jehovah
has given us a variety of research tools

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:50.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use in personal study and family worship.

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:53.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These include the <i>Watchtower Library</i>,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>JW Library</i>® app,

00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:00.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i>™<i>,</i>
and the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to be skillful
in using the tools he has provided

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:09.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the proverb
will come true for us that says:

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 “Have you seen a man skillful at his work?

00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:15.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will stand before kings.”

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:19.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what comes up on Neeta’s Bible study
that challenges her as a teacher,

00:04:24.424 --> 00:04:28.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how she realizes she needs help
to teach effectively,

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:31.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what research tool she uses

00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:34.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for her study with Jade.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . making a friend with God.

00:04:39.273 --> 00:04:41.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t know how to do that.

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:43.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a friend?

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve done fine with me.

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:49.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can see you—but God, a Friend?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seriously?

00:04:50.452 --> 00:04:52.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about what you can see?

00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does creation teach us about him?

00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:56.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, not much

00:04:56.625 --> 00:05:00.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe evolve or your species dies.

00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:02.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t really help.

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:06.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not talking about evolution.

00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:10.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m talking about the things
that God has created.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t suppose he’s got
a little workshop up there building things

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one at a time, do you?

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:18.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the real world, things evolve.

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:20.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all random.

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:22.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what that
tells me about him.

00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:25.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t ready for this.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evolution isn’t my strong suit.

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help.

00:05:41.047 --> 00:05:43.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be good:

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many who believe evolution. . . 

00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:51.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ancient tidal pool . . . 
chemicals spontaneously assembled . . .”

00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:54.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s too deep.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:58.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!
Maybe: “What does the evidence reveal? . . .

00:05:58.523 --> 00:06:01.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a cell to survive, . . . DNA . . .

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“RNA . . . inanimate chemicals. . .

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:06.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probability . . .”

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure this is what she needs.

00:06:10.327 --> 00:06:12.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her real issue

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was getting to know
someone that she can’t see.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s the best place to begin.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One widespread false teaching . . .

00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:31.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“robs people of hope . . . implies

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that human life has no purpose . . .”

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:37.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be it; establish the positive:

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:40.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What creation really says about Jehovah

00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:43.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
versus what evolution obscures.

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:46.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you got me thinking, . . .

00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:47.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I did some research, . . .

00:06:49.202 --> 00:06:50.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Yeah.

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I think
you’ll really like what I found.

00:06:52.664 --> 00:06:53.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:55.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, come, sit down.

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:56.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, let’s do this.

00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:15.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see where Neeta turned for help?

00:07:15.438 --> 00:07:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a little bit of searching
and persistence,

00:07:19.984 --> 00:07:22.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she found what she needed.

00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:24.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She got excited about the information

00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and passed that excitement on to her student.

00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:32.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you use
our research tools effectively?

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:37.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can use them to help you
to explain and teach the Scriptures.

00:07:37.044 --> 00:07:39.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, as with Jade,

00:07:39.213 --> 00:07:43.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your students may be struggling
to understand a Scriptural teaching.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may have a student
who is trying to overcome a personal problem.

00:07:47.013 --> 00:07:51.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use the tools that Jehovah
has given us to search for an explanation

00:07:51.893 --> 00:07:55.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an illustration that will help the person.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may not even have to do
all the work yourself.

00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:01.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you can show
your students how to use our tools

00:08:01.862 --> 00:08:05.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to find
the Bible’s answers to their questions.

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your best, though,
to learn how to use our research tools.

00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:16.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, you already use
<i>JW Library</i> for personal study

00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and family worship and to prepare
for congregation meetings.

00:08:20.048 --> 00:08:24.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you keep up-to-date
with new features in the <i>JW Library</i> app,

00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can also use it
to good advantage in your ministry.

00:08:29.558 --> 00:08:33.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are even features
built into the app that make it possible 

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to save the research
that you have done

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:39.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can use it again in the future.

00:08:39.109 --> 00:08:41.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are those features?

00:08:41.403 --> 00:08:44.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notes and tags

00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:46.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—notes and tags.

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you learned how to use them?

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:50.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now you can.

00:08:50.622 --> 00:08:53.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have <i>JW Library</i> with you on a device,

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:57.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open the Bible to 1 Timothy chapter 2

00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:59.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Timothy chapter 2—

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:03.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow along with this tutorial video.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you making full use of <i>JW Library®?</i>

00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:11.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s learn how some are using it,

00:09:11.393 --> 00:09:13.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then practice together.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:16.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I create notes in my Bible
for many different reasons.

00:09:16.858 --> 00:09:19.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a good point from a talk,

00:09:19.068 --> 00:09:23.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an illustration to help me
to explain something to a Bible student,

00:09:23.156 --> 00:09:26.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something for my own meditation.

00:09:26.117 --> 00:09:29.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I highlight the key phrase
and create a note.

00:09:29.621 --> 00:09:32.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:09:32.082 --> 00:09:34.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have <i>JW Library,</i>

00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:37.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find 1 Timothy 2:6 in the Bible.

00:09:39.173 --> 00:09:42.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now highlight the word “ransom,”

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:46.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tap the “Add a note” button.

00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:51.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then type your comment.

00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:57.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tapping the note marker in the margin

00:09:57.692 --> 00:10:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings your comment into view.

00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:02.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve created a lot of notes.

00:10:02.614 --> 00:10:05.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I use tags to help me find them again.

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:09.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, whenever I hear a point
that I want to use in the ministry,

00:10:09.747 --> 00:10:12.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I create a note and add a tag

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like “prayer,” “ransom,” or “last days.”

00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:20.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when I’m in the ministry,
I can quickly find my note.

00:10:20.758 --> 00:10:23.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:10:23.553 --> 00:10:26.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the note you just created,

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:28.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tap the three dots

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then “Edit.”

00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:35.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now tap the button “Add a tag,”

00:10:38.193 --> 00:10:40.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter a tag name.

00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:43.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case, type “ransom.”

00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:50.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can add as many tags as you like.

00:10:53.543 --> 00:10:55.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find your notes again,

00:10:55.712 --> 00:10:59.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to the Personal Study tab.

00:10:59.174 --> 00:11:02.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can type in the Search box,

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you can just tap the tag.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I read the Bible chapters
for the midweek meeting,

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:10.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often come across verses
that I want to understand better.

00:11:10.894 --> 00:11:12.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I check the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:16.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I use the points
I find in a comment at the meeting.

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:19.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you still at 1 Timothy chapter 2?

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:26.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tap on the number for verse 6,

00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:32.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then tap the <i>Research Guide</i> button
on the menu.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you can read information
that explains this verse.

00:11:38.757 --> 00:11:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can even copy a portion
of the research and paste it into your note.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are like me, you will probably
have to watch that video a few more times.

00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:54.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you find it challenging
to learn how to use

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:57.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the features of our tools,
here are two things you can do.

00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, ask someone
in your congregation to assist you,

00:12:02.157 --> 00:12:05.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often the young people can help the most.

00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:08.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, go to jw.org®,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scroll to the bottom of any page,

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:13.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
click on <i>JW Library,</i>

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:18.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there you will find
more tutorial videos that you can watch.

00:12:20.426 --> 00:12:23.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As announced at the 2018 annual meeting,

00:12:23.638 --> 00:12:28.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our research tools are being redesigned
to be unified and more user-friendly.

00:12:28.643 --> 00:12:32.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be sure to learn the new features
as they are released.

00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:35.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may you joyfully work with Jehovah

00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:40.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using the research tools
he has provided for making disciples.

00:12:41.907 --> 00:12:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium:

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:53.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Accept Jehovah’s Help—Our Brothers.”

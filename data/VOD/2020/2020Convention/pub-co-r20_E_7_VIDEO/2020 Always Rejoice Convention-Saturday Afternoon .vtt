Good day, brothers and sisters!

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:08.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you’ve been enjoying
the music-video presentations

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been prepared for this convention.

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:14.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s time to enjoy the next one.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:18.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch it, notice the joy that comes

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:21.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a life spent in Jehovah’s service.

00:09:37.062 --> 00:09:40.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us now stand and sing a song

00:09:40.027 --> 00:09:44.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reflects the joy we find
when we preach and teach with zeal.

00:09:44.497 --> 00:09:48.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please stand and sing song number 76,

00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:51.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “How Does It Make You Feel?”

00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:54.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s song number 76.

00:12:56.134 --> 00:12:58.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated. 

00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:03.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people
are preaching the good news earth wide,

00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:07.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we rejoice
to see many responding favorably.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:12.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn from the efforts
of our brothers around the world?

00:13:12.507 --> 00:13:16.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help honesthearted ones
to make progress?

00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:19.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following video features experiences

00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:22.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from six different regions.

00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:27.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Noumair, a helper
to the Teaching Committee, will be our host.

00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:31.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now join Brother Noumair and learn

00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How Our Brothers
Are Experiencing Disciple-Making Joy.”

00:13:42.873 --> 00:13:45.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were asked to think of two men

00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:49.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the first century
who were zealous disciple-makers,

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:51.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who would come to your mind?

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:54.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You may be thinking of Paul and Barnabas.

00:13:54.026 --> 00:13:56.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Together, they traveled extensively,

00:13:56.824 --> 00:13:59.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching the good news
and helping many

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn the wonderful truth
about Jehovah.

00:14:02.463 --> 00:14:07.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work brought joy
not only to them but others too.

00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:09.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 15:3 states:

00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:11.652 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“So after being escorted

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.950 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“partway by the congregation,

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“these men continued on

00:14:15.787 --> 00:14:18.586 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“through both Phoenicia and Samaria,

00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:21.259 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“relating in detail the conversion

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:23.181 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“of people of the nations

00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:26.397 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and bringing great joy to all the brothers.”

00:14:26.898 --> 00:14:28.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their shared experiences

00:14:28.986 --> 00:14:31.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were a great source of joy
to the brotherhood.

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all felt encouraged

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and united as one spiritual family.

00:14:37.967 --> 00:14:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, too, today, we have many
like Paul and Barnabas,

00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:46.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are actively working
to find honesthearted ones.

00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:48.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s quickly review the numbers

00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:52.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what
our spiritual family’s united efforts

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have accomplished
during the 2019 service year.

00:14:56.471 --> 00:15:00.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news was preached in 240 lands.

00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The average number of publishers

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each month reached over 8.4 million!

00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:08.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than two billion hours

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were spent in the field.

00:15:10.505 --> 00:15:13.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you’ll be pleased to know

00:15:13.638 --> 00:15:15.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the number baptized

00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:17.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surpassed 300,000

00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:21.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first time in 20 years!

00:15:21.031 --> 00:15:26.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s, on average, 5,843 people

00:15:26.043 --> 00:15:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symbolizing their dedication

00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:30.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah every weekend.

00:15:30.178 --> 00:15:32.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s great potential

00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:35.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for millions more to embrace the truth.

00:15:35.149 --> 00:15:38.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On average, 9.6 million Bible studies

00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:40.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were conducted each month,

00:15:40.871 --> 00:15:44.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and almost 21 million attended the Memorial.

00:15:44.714 --> 00:15:47.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We praise Jehovah for this growth

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:51.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thank you for your share
in this great increase.

00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:54.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body received

00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some beautiful experiences
and reports this past service year,

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:03.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they wanted to share
that joy with all of you now.

00:16:03.134 --> 00:16:06.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to hear
some of these reports

00:16:06.016 --> 00:16:09.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meet some
of our hardworking brothers and sisters?

00:16:09.608 --> 00:16:12.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, then, let’s go!

00:16:12.073 --> 00:16:15.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet publishers
from six regions of the earth

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear in their own words the effect

00:16:18.213 --> 00:16:21.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the disciple-making work
has on them.

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:23.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a quick peek.

00:16:25.147 --> 00:16:27.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see some
of their unique challenges.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it rains,

00:16:30.618 --> 00:16:32.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is so much mud everywhere

00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:35.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to remove our shoes
and hold them in our hands.

00:16:37.594 --> 00:16:41.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet ones
who made personal sacrifices.

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:43.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I turned 60 and retired,

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:47.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I decided
to serve where the need is greater.

00:16:48.412 --> 00:16:51.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brother can see,
but he cannot walk,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and me, I can walk but cannot see.

00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:59.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see the impact
the truth can have on new ones.

00:17:00.316 --> 00:17:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me happy.

00:17:02.363 --> 00:17:05.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:08.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was actually sort of in shock,

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:11.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really put a spotlight
on who I really was.

00:17:13.808 --> 00:17:16.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What bad habits did some have at first?

00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What pressures did they face?

00:17:21.577 --> 00:17:24.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did they overcome them?

00:17:25.963 --> 00:17:29.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day she asked her to choose

00:17:29.095 --> 00:17:31.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between family and Jehovah.

00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:36.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hopefully that whets your appetite
for what’s to come.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we take you around the world,

00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:43.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoy the stories
of your brothers and sisters

00:17:43.923 --> 00:17:47.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch for clues
to what contributed to their joy.

00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:50.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s begin with Africa.

00:17:52.653 --> 00:17:55.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stretches from the Mediterranean

00:17:55.577 --> 00:17:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
past the golden Sahara

00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:00.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through mountains and savannas

00:18:00.464 --> 00:18:02.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:18:02.511 --> 00:18:06.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This continent is known
for the enormous diversity

00:18:06.312 --> 00:18:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and richness of its wildlife.

00:18:09.611 --> 00:18:14.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Africa’s population,
about 1.3 billion people,

00:18:14.624 --> 00:18:17.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is growing faster
than any other part of the world.

00:18:18.884 --> 00:18:22.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 1,500 languages
are spoken here.

00:18:24.774 --> 00:18:27.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first Christian from Africa,

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:30.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ethiopian eunuch
mentioned in Acts chapter 8,

00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely brought the good news back with him

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:35.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Ethiopia when he returned home.

00:18:36.636 --> 00:18:41.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, over 1.7 million publishers

00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:44.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are making disciples
throughout this vast continent.

00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:49.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit our brothers and sisters
in Africa’s most populous country:

00:18:49.292 --> 00:18:51.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nigeria.

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:54.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 360,000 publishers

00:18:54.973 --> 00:18:59.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sharing the good news
with Nigeria’s over 200 million people.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The territory is highly diverse

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than 500 languages
and 250 ethnic groups.

00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:13.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so encouraging to see
the response to the good news!

00:19:13.017 --> 00:19:16.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some 870,000 Bible studies

00:19:16.818 --> 00:19:19.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being conducted and, on average,

00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:23.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
273 are baptized each week.

00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Utonkon Congregation
in Benue state.

00:19:29.098 --> 00:19:33.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, 51 publishers
and 4 regular pioneers

00:19:33.734 --> 00:19:38.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are having good results
despite a challenging territory.

00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:41.879 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Preaching in the Utonkon territory

00:19:41.879 --> 00:19:43.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is enjoyable.

00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:45.472 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is just that it is accompanied

00:19:45.472 --> 00:19:46.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by some problems.

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is that the territories
are very far apart,

00:19:51.988 --> 00:19:54.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and two, the roads are not good.

00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:58.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes us three hours
to get to some territories.

00:19:58.253 --> 00:20:02.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it rains,
there is so much mud everywhere

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to remove our shoes
and hold them in our hands.

00:20:06.607 --> 00:20:09.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether householders
are church-goers, Muslims,

00:20:09.614 --> 00:20:12.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or traditional healers, they listen.

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many even accept our invitation
to attend the meetings

00:20:15.545 --> 00:20:18.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the travel challenges.

00:20:18.636 --> 00:20:22.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it makes us very happy to see

00:20:22.396 --> 00:20:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in spite of far territories
and bad roads,

00:20:25.862 --> 00:20:27.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see good results.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.877 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I am enjoying my life now,

00:20:31.877 --> 00:20:33.882 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but when I lost my sight,

00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:35.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was all over.

00:20:35.887 --> 00:20:38.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a carpenter,
I wondered how I would be able

00:20:38.936 --> 00:20:40.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do my carpentry.

00:20:40.398 --> 00:20:42.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought of it worried me so much.

00:20:43.948 --> 00:20:46.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I began to learn about Jehovah
from the Bible,

00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:49.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize that there was hope.

00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:52.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That negative thinking
(that my life was over)

00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:54.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disappeared from my mind.

00:20:54.349 --> 00:20:55.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I am very happy now.

00:20:55.686 --> 00:20:57.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am joyful.

00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:00.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a brother named Joseph.

00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:03.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brother can see, but he cannot walk,

00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and me, I can walk but cannot see.

00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:08.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hold his wheelchair

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and push while he directs it.

00:21:10.723 --> 00:21:14.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has helped us to meet
many of our Bible students.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:17.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before now, we were few
that went out in the field as pioneers,

00:21:18.826 --> 00:21:21.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now we are many.

00:21:21.123 --> 00:21:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This shows that the example
has helped other people,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when they see someone
who cannot walk

00:21:27.388 --> 00:21:30.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and someone who cannot see are pioneering,

00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they conclude that they can pioneer too.

00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:37.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the experience
of one of my relatives.

00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:40.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name is Cletus.

00:21:40.963 --> 00:21:42.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very kind to me.

00:21:44.347 --> 00:21:48.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would hold my hand and assist me
to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.

00:21:48.189 --> 00:21:51.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he got to the Kingdom Hall,
he would leave for his church.

00:21:51.615 --> 00:21:56.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as he noticed how I preached
and attended meetings,

00:21:56.251 --> 00:21:58.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy I radiated,

00:21:58.506 --> 00:22:00.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way we treated other people,

00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our knowledge of the Scriptures,

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:05.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was impressed

00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:08.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and began asking many questions.

00:22:09.826 --> 00:22:13.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answers he got were quite different
from what he had learned,

00:22:13.335 --> 00:22:15.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they told him in church.

00:22:17.511 --> 00:22:20.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They continued telling him
to “get out of there”

00:22:20.268 --> 00:22:22.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he should not talk to me again.

00:22:27.118 --> 00:22:31.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He studied the Bible,
concluded his study, and got baptized.

00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:34.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he serves as a ministerial servant. 

00:22:35.723 --> 00:22:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they used to assign talks to both 

00:22:38.354 --> 00:22:40.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of us to handle as a symposium,

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:43.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this made me see Cletus
as a spiritual brother

00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:46.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the organization and the congregation.

00:22:48.755 --> 00:22:52.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives me joy and makes me very happy.

00:22:53.892 --> 00:22:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people notice our activities,

00:22:56.566 --> 00:22:59.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they usually praise Jehovah and encourage us

00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:02.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do more since they know
that the work we do

00:23:02.622 --> 00:23:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not by our power,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is Jehovah who empowers us.

00:23:07.718 --> 00:23:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is true that I am blind,

00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:12.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can see Jehovah.

00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:17.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am helping other people
see Jehovah’s hand in our lives.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even people who are disabled

00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:22.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can bring praise to Jehovah.

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:27.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have nothing to do other than to be joyful

00:23:27.976 --> 00:23:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise Jehovah for my life.

00:23:32.487 --> 00:23:35.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We share your joy, Brother Igbo!

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t it touch our hearts
to see Gabriel and Joseph

00:23:39.755 --> 00:23:42.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping each other in the pioneer work?

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:46.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their example
encourages others to ask,

00:23:46.187 --> 00:23:48.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What prevents me from pioneering?’

00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:52.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we’re moved
to ask that question too.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice
what spurred Cletus to action?

00:23:56.128 --> 00:23:58.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed the conduct of Gabriel

00:23:58.718 --> 00:24:00.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other Witnesses
in the congregation.

00:24:00.932 --> 00:24:03.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we learn?

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That our Christian conduct
often speaks louder

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:09.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than even the most eloquent words.

00:24:10.748 --> 00:24:15.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we go to the largest continent
in the world: Asia.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Asia is home to three fifths
of the world’s people,

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:24.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including some 760,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:24:24.866 --> 00:24:27.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The geography of Asia ranges

00:24:27.957 --> 00:24:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from tundra

00:24:30.212 --> 00:24:33.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to coral reefs

00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:36.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from Earth’s tallest peak, Mt. Everest,

00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:39.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to its lowest land surface, the Dead Sea.

00:24:41.114 --> 00:24:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Asia’s cultural diversity
is greater than any other continent.

00:24:44.038 --> 00:24:47.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two most populated countries
in the world

00:24:47.881 --> 00:24:50.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—China and India—

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:52.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are here in Asia.

00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit our brothers in India.

00:24:56.652 --> 00:25:00.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a growing population
of about 1.3 billion people,

00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:05.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
India is on track to become
the world’s most populous country

00:25:05.465 --> 00:25:07.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within a decade.

00:25:07.554 --> 00:25:11.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the potential for growth in India!

00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:14.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With 90 percent of the population

00:25:14.153 --> 00:25:16.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having not yet received a witness,

00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our 50,000 brothers and sisters
have plenty of work to do.

00:25:21.881 --> 00:25:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news is being preached

00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in territory that includes
mountain ranges, plains and plateaus,

00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:31.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
villages, and some
of the world’s largest cities.

00:25:33.492 --> 00:25:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hyderabad is in south-central India.

00:25:36.959 --> 00:25:41.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Hyderabad
RTC Cross Roads Congregation

00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the heart of the city.

00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:46.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, 94 publishers,

00:25:46.566 --> 00:25:48.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including 17 regular pioneers,

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:52.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducting 95 Bible studies.

00:25:52.873 --> 00:25:57.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were delighted
to have 252 attend last year’s Memorial.

00:25:58.846 --> 00:26:02.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s meet Sangram.

00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:06.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His story actually begins
in another part of India,

00:26:06.156 --> 00:26:10.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he learned the truth
with the help of Alex and Anne Das.

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I serve
in the Pandharpur Sign-Language Group.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Currently, there are only three publishers

00:26:22.112 --> 00:26:24.117 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—me, my wife,

00:26:24.117 --> 00:26:26.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and another brother who is deaf.

00:26:26.957 --> 00:26:31.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have contact
with around 100 deaf ones in our territory.

00:26:33.264 --> 00:26:37.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each week, 50 to 60 deaf ones
attend the meetings.

00:26:37.901 --> 00:26:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they come,
they bring their deaf friends with them.

00:26:41.284 --> 00:26:43.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also bring their relatives.

00:26:43.957 --> 00:26:48.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy to see them
come regularly for the meetings

00:26:48.134 --> 00:26:50.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of the opposition
from their families

00:26:50.891 --> 00:26:54.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes even severe opposition.

00:26:56.195 --> 00:26:59.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are progressing well spiritually.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are really happy
to see their spiritual advancement.

00:27:05.969 --> 00:27:08.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I turned 60 and retired,

00:27:08.768 --> 00:27:12.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I decided to serve
where the need is greater.

00:27:13.195 --> 00:27:16.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To our surprise, we were asked
to support the sign-language field.

00:27:16.996 --> 00:27:18.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,

00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:22.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did not have any experience
in sign language.

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:24.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then our circuit overseer asked us

00:27:24.682 --> 00:27:27.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were ready to move
to where the need is greater.

00:27:27.815 --> 00:27:30.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked if we would move to Latur,

00:27:30.739 --> 00:27:34.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city that was 521 miles
(838 km) from our home.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we reached the city,

00:27:37.505 --> 00:27:40.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were overjoyed to see
the interest of the deaf ones.

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:44.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we decided to stay there.

00:27:46.318 --> 00:27:49.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not long after we arrived there,

00:27:49.033 --> 00:27:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we met a priest whose name is Sangram.

00:27:52.375 --> 00:27:55.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the leader of a deaf association,

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:58.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was short-tempered.

00:27:59.935 --> 00:28:02.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we wanted to meet him often,

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:06.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we invited him to our home
to discuss the daily text.

00:28:06.744 --> 00:28:11.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came regularly at seven o’clock
for daily text discussions.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:16.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we moved here,
we did not know how to sign very well;

00:28:16.183 --> 00:28:19.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both my wife and I knew almost nothing.

00:28:19.024 --> 00:28:21.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after we met Sangram

00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:25.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to teach him the Bible,
we, in turn,

00:28:25.247 --> 00:28:27.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to learn sign language from him.

00:28:27.378 --> 00:28:29.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very happy.

00:28:29.382 --> 00:28:32.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really very happy.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we started studying
the Bible with Sangram,

00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:41.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made changes in his life
in line with the Bible principles.

00:28:41.078 --> 00:28:43.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He changed his hairstyle.

00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:47.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He left the deaf association
of which he was the leader.

00:28:48.304 --> 00:28:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even his personality changed.

00:28:50.727 --> 00:28:54.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He stopped responding angrily
to those who provoked him.

00:28:54.152 --> 00:28:56.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy

00:28:56.198 --> 00:28:59.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the Bible discussions we had with him,

00:28:59.331 --> 00:29:02.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because with these
his life changed completely.

00:29:02.673 --> 00:29:06.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he broke almost all of his bad habits.

00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:08.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:29:08.687 --> 00:29:12.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still unable to stop
his habit of chewing tobacco.

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:14.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since we loved him,

00:29:14.368 --> 00:29:17.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we took him to a dentist
and had his teeth cleaned.

00:29:18.754 --> 00:29:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that visit to the dentist,
he completely stopped using tobacco.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within six months
from starting the Bible study,

00:29:28.486 --> 00:29:31.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sangram became a qualified publisher,

00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:35.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after that,
he continued to progress well.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Latur now has a sign-language congregation.

00:29:41.017 --> 00:29:43.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
then moved to another group.

00:29:43.857 --> 00:29:47.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now serving in Pandharpur.

00:29:47.073 --> 00:29:50.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we meet
our old studies at the conventions

00:29:50.582 --> 00:29:54.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see their progress, we are overjoyed.

00:29:55.761 --> 00:30:00.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The very thought that Jehovah has extended
to us this privilege to serve him

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes us overwhelmed with happiness.

00:30:02.987 --> 00:30:06.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no words to express how we feel.

00:30:12.719 --> 00:30:15.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Sangram
showed us his big smile,

00:30:15.936 --> 00:30:18.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did a smile come to your face too?

00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:21.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how the truth affects us.

00:30:21.616 --> 00:30:26.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t we appreciate
the sacrifices that Alex and Anne made

00:30:26.086 --> 00:30:28.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to serve
where the need was greater?

00:30:28.842 --> 00:30:33.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to learn sign language
and move far away from their home.

00:30:33.437 --> 00:30:35.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did it turn out?

00:30:35.442 --> 00:30:39.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex says they are
“overwhelmed with happiness.”

00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:41.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that.

00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:45.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were certainly rewarded
for their sacrificing spirit.

00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now move west to Europe.

00:30:50.186 --> 00:30:53.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Europe gave birth
to the Greek and Roman Empires,

00:30:53.737 --> 00:30:56.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.

00:30:56.869 --> 00:31:01.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With 160 culturally distinct groups,

00:31:01.172 --> 00:31:04.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Europe is immensely varied
and densely populated.

00:31:06.393 --> 00:31:09.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Almost 1.6 million Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:13.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are actively making disciples
on this continent.

00:31:13.118 --> 00:31:16.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In southeastern Europe,

00:31:16.042 --> 00:31:18.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll find Romania

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:22.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a country of nearly 20 million people.

00:31:22.265 --> 00:31:26.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, over 39,000 publishers

00:31:26.693 --> 00:31:31.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducting
almost 22,000 Bible studies.

00:31:31.162 --> 00:31:35.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eight out of ten people belong
to the Romanian Orthodox Church.

00:31:35.798 --> 00:31:40.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ratio of publishers
to the population varies greatly,

00:31:40.268 --> 00:31:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1 to 4,000 in the southeast

00:31:43.526 --> 00:31:48.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 1 to 7 in Transylvania
in the northwest.

00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:52.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last year, special preaching campaigns

00:31:52.673 --> 00:31:56.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were organized to reach those
in unassigned territories.

00:31:56.349 --> 00:32:00.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, 85 percent
of these territories

00:32:00.484 --> 00:32:03.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been given a witness.

00:32:04.243 --> 00:32:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the 112 publishers
and 4 regular pioneers

00:32:09.214 --> 00:32:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Jibou Centru Congregation.

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:18.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They serve a territory
that includes a small city, rural areas,

00:32:18.278 --> 00:32:21.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and large communities
of Hungarians and Roma.

00:32:21.786 --> 00:32:25.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what it’s like
to make disciples there.

00:32:28.052 --> 00:32:30.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the challenges we face in our town

00:32:30.391 --> 00:32:32.437 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that we have a small territory

00:32:32.437 --> 00:32:34.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
compared to the number of brothers

00:32:34.484 --> 00:32:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a ratio of 1 publisher
to about 40 inhabitants.

00:32:39.455 --> 00:32:43.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we put great emphasis
on preaching in the villages around Jibou.

00:32:43.673 --> 00:32:45.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed our efforts,

00:32:45.678 --> 00:32:49.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have more Bible studies
who make good progress.

00:32:53.197 --> 00:32:55.243 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was still in elementary school,

00:32:55.243 --> 00:32:57.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not yet baptized myself,

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I used to speak about Jehovah

00:32:59.295 --> 00:33:01.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to one of my classmates.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her name was Oana.

00:33:03.305 --> 00:33:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very interested
and even asked many questions.

00:33:07.022 --> 00:33:09.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were both 12 at that time.

00:33:09.403 --> 00:33:12.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A little while later, after I got baptized,

00:33:12.578 --> 00:33:15.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana became my first Bible student.

00:33:20.347 --> 00:33:23.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to show her how
to prepare well for the study.

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:28.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the evening,
we used to read the Bible together,

00:33:28.032 --> 00:33:31.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we even wrote down
in a notebook our favorite Bible texts.

00:33:31.499 --> 00:33:36.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
by means of different study projects,

00:33:36.177 --> 00:33:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to help her
see Jehovah as a real Person.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we wrote down
on a big sheet of paper

00:33:43.612 --> 00:33:46.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Jehovah’s qualities
and the way we could imitate them.

00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:52.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana made good progress,
attended the meetings,

00:33:52.718 --> 00:33:54.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even started to participate.

00:33:56.769 --> 00:33:58.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy to see

00:33:58.774 --> 00:34:02.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much joy Oana had
in learning about the truth.

00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:08.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not surprisingly,
difficulties arose on the way.

00:34:08.465 --> 00:34:13.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana’s mother was not happy at all
that I was studying with her daughter.

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:19.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She forbade her to study,
and one day she asked her

00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:23.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to choose between family and Jehovah

00:34:23.084 --> 00:34:25.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put her out of the house.

00:34:25.256 --> 00:34:27.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana was 16 years old.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:33.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I encouraged Oana with the scripture

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:36.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Isaiah 41:10, 13,

00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:39.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jehovah
is ‘grasping our hand’

00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:41.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will ‘help us.’

00:34:43.175 --> 00:34:46.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We talked a lot together,
and we prayed together.

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:50.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after only one week,
Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:34:50.944 --> 00:34:55.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana’s mother calmed down
and not only allowed her to return home

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to attend meetings
and to continue studying together.

00:34:59.799 --> 00:35:03.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy!

00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the 21st of July, 2018,

00:35:07.443 --> 00:35:09.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana got baptized.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I can finally preach
together with my spiritual sister.

00:35:15.128 --> 00:35:17.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always gave me the joy I needed.

00:35:17.969 --> 00:35:19.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I can’t find

00:35:19.974 --> 00:35:23.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the words to describe
the joy I experience now.

00:35:28.912 --> 00:35:30.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice where and when

00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:34.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beatrice started talking
to Oana about Jehovah?

00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:36.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In elementary school.

00:35:36.932 --> 00:35:38.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful reminder

00:35:38.979 --> 00:35:41.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you young ones can experience joy

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making school your personal territory!

00:35:45.077 --> 00:35:47.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you haven’t tried it already,

00:35:47.124 --> 00:35:50.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for someone with whom
you can share the good news.

00:35:50.757 --> 00:35:53.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be surprised at the results.

00:35:54.475 --> 00:35:57.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go next to North America.

00:35:57.775 --> 00:36:01.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this continent extends
from the tiny islands near the Arctic

00:36:01.743 --> 00:36:04.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Isthmus of Panama in the south.

00:36:06.087 --> 00:36:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
North America is home to almost
2.6 million Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:17.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The United States is by far
the most populous country in North America,

00:36:17.072 --> 00:36:20.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with over 325 million people.

00:36:20.748 --> 00:36:24.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you can find metropolitan cities

00:36:24.632 --> 00:36:27.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as vast areas
that are sparsely populated.

00:36:29.269 --> 00:36:31.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This territory is cared for

00:36:31.315 --> 00:36:34.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more than 1.2 million publishers

00:36:34.615 --> 00:36:38.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and over 180,000 pioneers.

00:36:39.753 --> 00:36:41.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet the brothers and sisters

00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:45.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Juniata River
Pennsylvania German Congregation

00:36:45.016 --> 00:36:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.

00:36:48.524 --> 00:36:51.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see in the following report,

00:36:51.448 --> 00:36:54.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their unique territory is rich with people

00:36:54.038 --> 00:36:57.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sincerely respect God’s Word.

00:37:07.989 --> 00:37:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge is
our territory being so vast.

00:37:11.414 --> 00:37:13.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you may drive
an hour and a half to two hours

00:37:13.962 --> 00:37:16.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to get to the territory.

00:37:16.593 --> 00:37:18.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of my favorite joys

00:37:18.598 --> 00:37:21.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is getting to use
the Bible constantly in this field.

00:37:21.647 --> 00:37:23.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They respect the Bible.

00:37:23.694 --> 00:37:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all have one in their house.

00:37:27.161 --> 00:37:30.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting this language
almost three years ago, from a pregroup

00:37:30.461 --> 00:37:34.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to now a congregation with four groups
in the area, you can see the growth

00:37:34.011 --> 00:37:36.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the excitement of everyone.

00:37:38.104 --> 00:37:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, I can say it’s been
the happiest time in my life

00:37:41.237 --> 00:37:43.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I started working in this field.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out in service one day,
just working from door to door,

00:37:53.935 --> 00:37:57.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I met a lady, and she
accepted the <i>Greatest Man</i>  book.

00:37:57.443 --> 00:37:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually,
Memorial season came around.

00:37:59.908 --> 00:38:03.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went and left an invitation with Jane.

00:38:03.082 --> 00:38:05.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went back
the day before the Memorial

00:38:05.463 --> 00:38:07.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were surprised when Jane said,

00:38:07.426 --> 00:38:09.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, we’d love to come.”

00:38:09.724 --> 00:38:12.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we talked about a Bible study,

00:38:12.104 --> 00:38:14.569 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and eventually Jerry agreed

00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:16.574 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to having one as a family.

00:38:18.203 --> 00:38:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a contrast
from what I’d been taught,

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:25.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I was willing
to dig for more knowledge

00:38:25.763 --> 00:38:29.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try and figure out
what was going on here.

00:38:29.188 --> 00:38:31.485 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He read a scripture in Psalms

00:38:31.485 --> 00:38:34.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the earth, and I said:

00:38:34.451 --> 00:38:38.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wow! Yes, all the things
I pictured myself doing in heaven

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the things I enjoy on earth.”

00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:45.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me happy.

00:38:45.144 --> 00:38:47.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:38:49.112 --> 00:38:52.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I studied about the Bible
and looked up the scriptures,

00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:57.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more I realized I never really knew
a whole lot about the Bible.

00:38:57.675 --> 00:38:59.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was actually sort of in shock,

00:38:59.805 --> 00:39:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really put a spotlight
on who I really was.

00:39:05.235 --> 00:39:08.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, Ben and I
went over to make a return visit.

00:39:08.493 --> 00:39:12.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had planned
what we wanted to do with the family,

00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:16.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just did not lend to that at all,

00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:18.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we ended up playing cards instead.

00:39:18.852 --> 00:39:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t get to share anything
from the Bible.

00:39:21.483 --> 00:39:23.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family was like, ‘Oh.’

00:39:23.822 --> 00:39:26.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It dawned on them;
we’re real people too.

00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:32.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Pennsylvania German culture,
people teach pretty strongly

00:39:32.218 --> 00:39:35.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obedience to parents
to make God happy.

00:39:35.267 --> 00:39:38.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Jerry let me know
that his dad wanted to talk to me.

00:39:38.483 --> 00:39:42.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although my dad meant well,
he tried to stop the study.

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:47.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the information that he was 
bringing to me about the Witnesses

00:39:47.338 --> 00:39:49.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not what I saw.

00:39:49.844 --> 00:39:51.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we were being taught

00:39:51.891 --> 00:39:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was directly from my Bible
that I had in my house.

00:39:55.024 --> 00:39:57.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could it be wrong?

00:39:58.323 --> 00:40:02.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could tell that they were just distraught
as a family with what was going on.

00:40:02.375 --> 00:40:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to do the right thing,
but they could feel all the pressure to stop.

00:40:09.016 --> 00:40:11.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We eventually had to cut ties

00:40:11.606 --> 00:40:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to continue spiritual growth.

00:40:17.579 --> 00:40:20.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, Jerry and Jane
just progressed very fast.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were making changes in their life,

00:40:22.215 --> 00:40:25.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they got to really see the freedom
that serving Jehovah gives you.

00:40:26.852 --> 00:40:28.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing their joy grow

00:40:28.857 --> 00:40:32.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was irreplaceable; it was fantastic.

00:40:37.336 --> 00:40:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have gained a hundredfold
of what we could have ever lost.

00:40:43.142 --> 00:40:45.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so as we share good news

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:48.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with individuals
and as they make progress,

00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:51.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are very excited and happy.

00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:54.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would just love for everyone to have

00:40:54.002 --> 00:40:56.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that opportunity to have that same joy.

00:40:58.847 --> 00:41:01.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened when Jerry and Jane

00:41:01.395 --> 00:41:05.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
read for themselves
the truths contained in the Bible?

00:41:05.614 --> 00:41:08.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It deeply affected
their thoughts and emotions

00:41:08.955 --> 00:41:12.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and revealed
who they really were on the inside.

00:41:12.338 --> 00:41:16.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, they now
joyfully serve Jehovah

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with their children.

00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:22.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben and Joanna used the Bible skillfully.

00:41:22.614 --> 00:41:25.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They let God’s Word speak for itself.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the joy this experience
brought them is,

00:41:29.004 --> 00:41:33.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Ben said, 
“irreplaceable; . . . fantastic.”

00:41:33.474 --> 00:41:36.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of joy is contagious.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel it too just watching them.

00:41:39.823 --> 00:41:42.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next we go to Oceania.

00:41:42.997 --> 00:41:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the collective name for Australia

00:41:46.422 --> 00:41:49.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the more than 10,000 islands

00:41:49.304 --> 00:41:51.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Pacific Ocean
between Asia and the Americas.

00:41:54.943 --> 00:41:57.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of Oceania’s islands,

00:41:57.449 --> 00:42:01.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are known as “high islands”
because they were developed

00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:05.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as volcanic eruptions
built up land over time.

00:42:05.636 --> 00:42:09.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Low islands,”
such as the country of Kiribati,

00:42:09.855 --> 00:42:14.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are made of coral and sometimes
barely reach above sea level.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 100,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses
are hard at work

00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:20.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this beautiful territory. 

00:42:22.803 --> 00:42:26.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fiji is an archipelago
of some 300 islands

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scattered over 3 million
square kilometers,

00:42:30.739 --> 00:42:33.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about 1 million square miles.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This territory is cared for

00:42:36.879 --> 00:42:41.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by some 3,000 publishers
and over 500 pioneers.

00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the last service year,

00:42:44.356 --> 00:42:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they conducted over 4,700 Bible studies.

00:42:49.452 --> 00:42:51.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers and sisters

00:42:51.624 --> 00:42:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in the South Suva
English Congregation.

00:42:54.464 --> 00:42:59.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what unique challenges
our brothers face there.

00:43:01.064 --> 00:43:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many, if not all, in our territory
know about God’s Word, the Bible.

00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:08.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, they are taught false teachings.

00:43:08.707 --> 00:43:10.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge arises

00:43:10.128 --> 00:43:13.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when customs and traditions

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
conflict with Bible teachings.

00:43:15.766 --> 00:43:18.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they study and progress,

00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face opposition from their family

00:43:20.236 --> 00:43:22.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, there’s the social pressure

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from their community.

00:43:25.081 --> 00:43:28.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Added to this are the materialistic goals
that are put before them.

00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:33.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of this combined really poses
a challenge with these ones progressing.

00:43:33.184 --> 00:43:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite these challenges,

00:43:34.437 --> 00:43:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of them eventually do
study the Bible with us.

00:43:39.115 --> 00:43:42.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have become Jehovah’s friend
and made the truth their own.

00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:45.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to be able to show these ones
from God’s Word,

00:43:45.924 --> 00:43:49.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible, that Jehovah is a God of love

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:53.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see their reaction
—that in itself is a wonderful blessing.

00:43:55.364 --> 00:43:57.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to study with this young girl.

00:43:57.744 --> 00:44:00.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to make progress in the truth.

00:44:00.585 --> 00:44:02.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in order for her to do that,

00:44:02.924 --> 00:44:06.182 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she had to overcome these two big obstacles:

00:44:06.182 --> 00:44:09.440 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One was the career that she had,

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other was the obstacle
of her unbelieving family.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t want
to impose the truth on her,

00:44:18.337 --> 00:44:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my goal was to help her
understand what the Bible teaches,

00:44:22.138 --> 00:44:24.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help her see the big picture,

00:44:24.268 --> 00:44:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let her draw her own conclusion.

00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:33.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to be a good example to her by enjoying

00:44:33.373 --> 00:44:35.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ministry myself, you know,

00:44:35.921 --> 00:44:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping her to understand
that as I’m out in the ministry,

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:42.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I’m working along with Jehovah.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although she had a high-paying job,

00:44:45.612 --> 00:44:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wasn’t happy.

00:44:48.076 --> 00:44:50.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was always stressed.

00:44:50.457 --> 00:44:53.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then she sees Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:44:53.172 --> 00:44:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite being out there in the ministry

00:44:55.386 --> 00:44:58.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on hot, sunny days or rainy days,

00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re happy.

00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:02.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She knew and was convinced

00:45:02.779 --> 00:45:05.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would be really happy

00:45:05.118 --> 00:45:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she put Jehovah first in her life.

00:45:07.917 --> 00:45:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So eventually she had to tell
her mother-in-law

00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:13.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she had resigned from her employment.

00:45:13.764 --> 00:45:15.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So her mother-in-law said:

00:45:15.936 --> 00:45:17.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And now you’ve resigned?

00:45:17.941 --> 00:45:18.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, what are you going to do?

00:45:18.944 --> 00:45:20.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to go preaching?”

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she said:

00:45:22.202 --> 00:45:26.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The decision that I have made
is going to make me happy.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to make Jehovah happy as well.”

00:45:29.302 --> 00:45:31.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In seeing the big picture,

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was able to take a stand for true worship

00:45:34.482 --> 00:45:37.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be on Jehovah’s side
of universal sovereignty.

00:45:38.784 --> 00:45:41.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I attended
the Pioneer Service School with her.

00:45:42.877 --> 00:45:45.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, what really made me happy

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was seeing ones like her

00:45:47.931 --> 00:45:51.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being happy in doing the same work

00:45:51.189 --> 00:45:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of helping others come to serve Jehovah

00:45:53.236 --> 00:45:57.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowing the fact
that Jehovah had actually used me

00:45:57.956 --> 00:46:00.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping others

00:46:00.337 --> 00:46:02.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find the truth and serve Jehovah as well.

00:46:08.983 --> 00:46:12.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To some, Fiji may seem like paradise.

00:46:12.325 --> 00:46:15.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we learned,
the people of that beautiful land

00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:18.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face the same issues
as people everywhere

00:46:18.757 --> 00:46:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—stress, pressure-filled jobs,
and an uncertain future.

00:46:23.686 --> 00:46:27.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Makereta’s student learned,
putting Jehovah first

00:46:27.988 --> 00:46:32.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the only guarantee
for true, lasting happiness.

00:46:34.045 --> 00:46:37.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our final destination is South America.

00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:42.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South America is home
to earth’s largest river, the Amazon,

00:46:42.691 --> 00:46:47.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the driest place,
the Atacama Desert.

00:46:47.035 --> 00:46:51.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animal life on this continent
is rich and diverse,

00:46:51.838 --> 00:46:55.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly its bird population.

00:46:55.389 --> 00:46:58.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With some 3,000 species of birds,

00:46:58.313 --> 00:47:02.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South America is sometimes
called the bird continent.

00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:07.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 400 million people live here,

00:47:07.126 --> 00:47:11.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including over 1.7 million
Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:47:13.851 --> 00:47:16.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is tremendous
language diversity

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in South America.

00:47:20.158 --> 00:47:22.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit Bolivia,

00:47:22.163 --> 00:47:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a country of more than 11 million people

00:47:25.337 --> 00:47:29.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a wide range of indigenous cultures.

00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:32.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bolivia presents unique challenges

00:47:32.313 --> 00:47:36.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our about 28,000 brothers
and sisters who live here.

00:47:38.703 --> 00:47:42.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory includes
the towering Andes Mountains in the west

00:47:42.128 --> 00:47:45.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rain forests in the north.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers endure weather

00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:51.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ranges from burning heat 
and tropical humidity

00:47:51.276 --> 00:47:54.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to freezing winds.

00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:56.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach remote territories,

00:47:56.664 --> 00:48:00.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may have to cross rivers
and drive for hours

00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:03.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on poorly maintained mountain roads

00:48:03.055 --> 00:48:07.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes just a few millimeters,
or inches, from the precipice!

00:48:07.984 --> 00:48:12.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Jehovah is blessing
their courageous efforts!

00:48:12.035 --> 00:48:15.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the last service year alone,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 42,000 Bible studies
were conducted.

00:48:20.055 --> 00:48:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the 35 publishers
and 8 regular pioneers

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Norte Quechua Congregation.

00:48:28.283 --> 00:48:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach and seek out those
who speak Quechua,

00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:34.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publishers travel long distances.

00:48:34.883 --> 00:48:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, many
of the Quechua-speaking community

00:48:38.893 --> 00:48:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been victims of prejudice

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not receive basic education
in their language.

00:48:44.908 --> 00:48:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters spend hours

00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping interested ones learn to read

00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:53.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can
comprehend basic Bible truths.

00:48:54.514 --> 00:48:59.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The response to the good news
in Bolivia is very positive.

00:48:59.026 --> 00:49:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we’ll learn in the following report,

00:49:02.492 --> 00:49:05.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible students
frequently face opposition,

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:09.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often from those closest to them.

00:49:10.888 --> 00:49:13.436 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When an interested person begins to learn

00:49:13.436 --> 00:49:15.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the truth from the Bible,

00:49:15.524 --> 00:49:17.613 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at first the family is happy for them,

00:49:17.613 --> 00:49:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their friends are happy too.

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:25.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the teachings of the Bible
are in opposition to popular customs,

00:49:25.382 --> 00:49:29.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those family members and friends
may become their main source of opposition.

00:49:30.895 --> 00:49:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we have also seen many,
many blessings from Jehovah.

00:49:35.824 --> 00:49:38.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
although the challenges may be great,

00:49:38.832 --> 00:49:40.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see Jehovah’s hand

00:49:40.795 --> 00:49:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working in the lives
of each of these individuals,

00:49:43.259 --> 00:49:46.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they make <i>huge </i> changes.

00:49:46.308 --> 00:49:49.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They take hold of Jehovah,
they see him as their God,

00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:53.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they leave behind popular customs
and start to make progress.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a beautiful blessing
to see a Bible student

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get baptized, filled with joy.

00:50:00.844 --> 00:50:02.974 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Lydia was a young woman

00:50:02.974 --> 00:50:07.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who was very interested in spiritual things.

00:50:07.402 --> 00:50:11.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just like anyone
who does not study the Bible,

00:50:11.662 --> 00:50:15.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had habits
that were not pleasing to Jehovah.

00:50:15.756 --> 00:50:18.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She liked to socialize with her workmates,

00:50:18.512 --> 00:50:21.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at times,
she went out drinking with her friends

00:50:21.979 --> 00:50:26.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes drinking a little too much.

00:50:27.743 --> 00:50:32.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, despite that,
she was very humble.

00:50:32.338 --> 00:50:35.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could see that she was very sincere;

00:50:35.512 --> 00:50:39.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she appreciated good things.

00:50:39.146 --> 00:50:42.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After seeing
these beautiful qualities in her, 

00:50:42.697 --> 00:50:46.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Jehovah can make

00:50:46.163 --> 00:50:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other good qualities grow in her heart.”

00:50:50.173 --> 00:50:53.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we set the date to start the study.

00:50:53.473 --> 00:50:56.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always tried to be consistent

00:50:56.564 --> 00:50:59.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to not miss a study.

00:50:59.613 --> 00:51:03.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a publisher does not miss
the day and time for the study,

00:51:03.414 --> 00:51:08.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Devil is not given
the opportunity to disrupt it.

00:51:09.888 --> 00:51:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some teachings Lydia accepted immediately,

00:51:14.274 --> 00:51:17.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but others took more time.

00:51:18.535 --> 00:51:21.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her manner of dress was not appropriate;

00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:25.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wore tight clothing
and very short skirts.

00:51:25.886 --> 00:51:28.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did we correct that?

00:51:28.183 --> 00:51:30.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By showing her in the Bible

00:51:30.856 --> 00:51:35.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that women should dress
“with modesty and soundness of mind.”

00:51:35.117 --> 00:51:38.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy, but she did it.

00:51:38.291 --> 00:51:42.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, when she attended meetings,
she looked like one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:51:45.434 --> 00:51:48.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you plant a literal plant,
you start to water it

00:51:48.775 --> 00:51:51.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it keeps growing.

00:51:51.198 --> 00:51:55.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you are sleeping,
you don’t know how those changes happen.

00:51:55.793 --> 00:52:00.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It happens exactly the same way
with a Bible student.

00:52:02.685 --> 00:52:06.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time passed, Lydia expressed
the desire to be baptized.

00:52:06.151 --> 00:52:09.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, she just kept making progress

00:52:09.994 --> 00:52:12.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to serve as a regular pioneer.

00:52:12.918 --> 00:52:16.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later,
she was invited to serve at Bethel.

00:52:17.346 --> 00:52:20.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has been serving
at Bethel for 16 years.

00:52:24.196 --> 00:52:26.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I am one of the 70 persons

00:52:26.451 --> 00:52:28.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who learned the truth from Edith.

00:52:29.166 --> 00:52:32.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her example helped me

00:52:32.591 --> 00:52:37.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be considerate, to be insightful,

00:52:37.019 --> 00:52:38.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to be consistent

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making disciples.

00:52:43.284 --> 00:52:45.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:52:45.331 --> 00:52:49.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned so much
about disciple-making,

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially that this work is not ours.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Bible students make progress,

00:52:57.862 --> 00:53:01.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah,

00:53:01.329 --> 00:53:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because He sees their hearts.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re not working for a man;

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:11.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re working for the Most High God.

00:53:13.734 --> 00:53:18.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to see
ones like Lydia learn the truth

00:53:18.746 --> 00:53:22.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with God’s help
make the needed changes!

00:53:22.756 --> 00:53:26.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what joy it continues to bring
to her teacher, Edith,

00:53:26.265 --> 00:53:28.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see her serving Jehovah today!

00:53:30.024 --> 00:53:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Edith says,
“When Bible students make progress,

00:53:33.449 --> 00:53:36.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah,

00:53:36.582 --> 00:53:39.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because He sees their hearts.”

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:42.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in our time together,

00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:47.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve circled the earth
to bring you these experiences.

00:53:47.609 --> 00:53:51.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice any patterns
for joyful disciple-making?

00:53:51.911 --> 00:53:55.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are just four patterns
that stood out to me.

00:53:55.712 --> 00:53:58.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that the first step

00:53:58.009 --> 00:54:02.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to seek out all those
with the right heart condition.

00:54:03.899 --> 00:54:06.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers in Nigeria,

00:54:06.196 --> 00:54:09.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fiji, and Bolivia

00:54:09.454 --> 00:54:13.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread the good news
despite the great distances,

00:54:13.547 --> 00:54:16.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
poor roads, and extreme weather.

00:54:17.516 --> 00:54:20.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gabriel and Joseph teamed up

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:22.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome their disabilities,

00:54:22.904 --> 00:54:27.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their example
inspires us to do more.

00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:31.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex and Anne Das
learned sign language

00:54:31.466 --> 00:54:33.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moved more than 500 miles

00:54:33.973 --> 00:54:37.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve where the need was greater.

00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:40.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we saw a second vital element

00:54:40.405 --> 00:54:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in disciple-making: the “art of teaching.”

00:54:44.874 --> 00:54:47.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know, for example,
that helping students

00:54:47.965 --> 00:54:51.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reason on the Scriptures
is very effective.

00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:53.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the case with Makereta.

00:54:54.941 --> 00:54:58.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using the Scriptures,
she helped her student

00:54:58.073 --> 00:55:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draw her own conclusions
about the truth.

00:55:03.336 --> 00:55:06.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benjamin and Joanna
skillfully used the Bible

00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:08.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jerry and Jane.

00:55:08.933 --> 00:55:13.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The power of the Scriptures
touched their hearts.

00:55:13.486 --> 00:55:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when opposition came,
they stood firm

00:55:17.162 --> 00:55:21.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were convinced
that they were learning the truth

00:55:21.381 --> 00:55:23.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God’s inspired Word.

00:55:25.056 --> 00:55:29.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third element of disciple-making
involves helping our students

00:55:29.233 --> 00:55:34.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop good study habits
and a regular spiritual routine.

00:55:35.499 --> 00:55:39.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Edith and Lydia
made it a goal never to miss a study.

00:55:41.639 --> 00:55:46.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beatrice showed creativity,
developing projects

00:55:46.651 --> 00:55:50.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that big sheet of paper to help Oana
know Jehovah as a real Person.

00:55:50.995 --> 00:55:54.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And fourth: In every experience,

00:55:54.169 --> 00:55:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw that disciple-making involves love

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:00.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—showing genuine love.

00:56:01.396 --> 00:56:06.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex and Anne took Sangram
to the dentist because they love him.

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:11.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What motivated Cletus
to study the Bible?

00:56:11.211 --> 00:56:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy radiated by Jehovah’s people

00:56:14.595 --> 00:56:17.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the loving way we treat others.

00:56:19.231 --> 00:56:24.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angeline gave up
her stressful job and put Jehovah first.

00:56:24.034 --> 00:56:25.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:56:25.663 --> 00:56:28.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because she
observed Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:28.295 --> 00:56:31.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who out of self-sacrificing love

00:56:31.219 --> 00:56:33.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were motivated to preach the good news

00:56:33.975 --> 00:56:36.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on hot days and rainy days,

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she especially noted
the joy it brought them.

00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:45.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see,
the joy of Jehovah

00:56:45.629 --> 00:56:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes from sincere efforts
to help people

00:56:49.138 --> 00:56:52.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah’s blessing on those efforts.

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:56.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see and hear your brothers’
and sisters’ heartfelt expressions,

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how does it make you feel?

00:56:59.162 --> 00:57:01.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul and Barnabas,

00:57:01.167 --> 00:57:05.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too may have challenges
along the way, even some setbacks.

00:57:05.553 --> 00:57:09.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But nothing compares
with the deep joy and happiness

00:57:09.813 --> 00:57:14.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that results from helping others
come to know and love Jehovah.

00:57:15.285 --> 00:57:17.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are still
honesthearted ones out there,

00:57:17.917 --> 00:57:21.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they desperately need the truth.

00:57:21.342 --> 00:57:25.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s experiences like the ones
we’ve just listened to

00:57:25.226 --> 00:57:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help us to see that Jehovah
is truly speeding up the work.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time you go out in service,

00:57:33.455 --> 00:57:37.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
picture yourself working side by side

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:40.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your brothers and sisters
around the world.

00:57:40.931 --> 00:57:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as in a search and rescue effort,

00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:48.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may feel we’re not finding
survivors in our area.

00:57:48.366 --> 00:57:52.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just one report of a rescue victim

00:57:52.418 --> 00:57:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being pulled out alive
spurs on all the volunteers

00:57:56.261 --> 00:57:58.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to double their efforts.

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:01.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy Jehovah feels

00:58:01.733 --> 00:58:05.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he looks down and sees us

00:58:05.074 --> 00:58:09.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across the globe
working “shoulder to shoulder”

00:58:09.126 --> 00:58:13.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the greatest rescue mission
of all time!

00:58:13.303 --> 00:58:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep calling out;

00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:18.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep searching
through the rubble of this dying system

00:58:18.983 --> 00:58:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find those crying out for help.

00:58:22.158 --> 00:58:26.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may your joy abound as you do so.

00:58:28.924 --> 00:58:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How exciting to see the ways
that our brothers and sisters

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:36.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are helping people
to respond to the good news!

00:58:36.819 --> 00:58:40.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we assist those
with whom we study the Bible

00:58:40.954 --> 00:58:44.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to progress to dedication and baptism?

00:58:44.128 --> 00:58:47.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following symposium discusses five areas

00:58:47.887 --> 00:58:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which our Bible students need our help.

00:58:50.853 --> 00:58:54.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will introduce the one to follow.

00:58:54.779 --> 00:58:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body

00:58:57.912 --> 00:59:00.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the first talk, entitled

00:59:00.627 --> 00:59:05.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students to . . .
Feed Themselves Spiritually.”

00:59:11.571 --> 00:59:14.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before our Lord Jesus returned to heaven,

00:59:14.494 --> 00:59:18.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave what has been called
the great commission.

00:59:18.212 --> 00:59:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:59:21.971 --> 00:59:26.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of people of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:59:26.983 --> 00:59:30.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the Son and of the holy spirit.”

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you have those words
in your mind as well.

00:59:34.544 --> 00:59:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was not satisfied

00:59:37.133 --> 00:59:40.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people should just
come to know his teachings.

00:59:40.725 --> 00:59:44.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus wanted people
to come to love his teachings

00:59:44.777 --> 00:59:49.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they would act on them,
so that they would live by them,

00:59:49.372 --> 00:59:53.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so that they would become
his true disciples.

00:59:53.507 --> 00:59:56.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why did Jesus want people

00:59:56.807 --> 01:00:00.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become his disciples
and live by his teachings?

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:03.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because of something
that we read here

01:00:03.156 --> 01:00:06.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 13:17.

01:00:06.998 --> 01:00:10.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what Jesus said here:

01:00:10.047 --> 01:00:13.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you know these things,

01:00:13.097 --> 01:00:16.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happy you are if you do them.”

01:00:16.605 --> 01:00:18.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

01:00:18.652 --> 01:00:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was saying that people
would find real happiness,

01:00:23.247 --> 01:00:27.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would find the way of salvation,
they would have a relationship

01:00:27.632 --> 01:00:32.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his precious heavenly Father
if they would just come to know

01:00:32.143 --> 01:00:35.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do the things that he had taught.

01:00:35.401 --> 01:00:38.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,
in this symposium,

01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are going to discuss
five different things

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:46.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our Bible students need to do,
that they need to progress in,

01:00:46.512 --> 01:00:51.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are going to become
true disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:00:51.524 --> 01:00:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about the first.

01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:58.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the most basic need
that our Bible students have?

01:00:58.876 --> 01:01:03.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s what Jesus talked about here
in Matthew chapter 5.

01:01:03.303 --> 01:01:05.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:3

01:01:10.028 --> 01:01:13.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus said: “Happy are those conscious 

01:01:13.453 --> 01:01:17.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of their [notice] spiritual need,

01:01:17.505 --> 01:01:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the Kingdom
of the heavens belongs to them.”

01:01:21.055 --> 01:01:23.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus showed
that honesthearted people

01:01:26.736 --> 01:01:28.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a spiritual need.

01:01:28.908 --> 01:01:33.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have a need to come to know God
and to have a relationship with him

01:01:33.252 --> 01:01:36.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are really going to be happy.

01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:39.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to teach

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:42.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible students the very first thing:

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:46.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they can fill that spiritual need

01:01:46.534 --> 01:01:50.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning
about their heavenly Father, Jehovah.

01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:54.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they fill that need, as they come
to have that relationship with God,

01:01:54.846 --> 01:01:57.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is the way to true happiness.

01:01:57.979 --> 01:02:02.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means more than just
feeding people information.

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, there is a saying
that’s very familiar to most of us.

01:02:06.249 --> 01:02:10.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says, “Give a man a fish,
feed him for a day;

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:14.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teach him how to fish,
feed him for a lifetime.”

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

01:02:16.525 --> 01:02:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we can teach our Bible students
how to feed themselves spiritually,

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:24.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then they have the way in front of them

01:02:24.461 --> 01:02:28.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a close relationship with God,
to strong faith,

01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:32.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to becoming
real disciples of Jesus Christ.

01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:36.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the following demonstration
that you’ll see on video,

01:02:36.616 --> 01:02:39.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just notice how our Bible teacher

01:02:39.539 --> 01:02:42.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps her student to be able to do this.

01:02:56.665 --> 01:02:59.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . just sum up the whole article.

01:03:01.259 --> 01:03:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it.

01:03:03.306 --> 01:03:05.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the answers in all that.

01:03:06.773 --> 01:03:08.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than just the answers.

01:03:08.778 --> 01:03:11.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m with it; I’m all about study.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you
remember more from our studies,

01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:21.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answers or the things
that touch your heart?

01:03:22.979 --> 01:03:24.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm.

01:03:24.608 --> 01:03:28.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, like,
when we talked about immorality,

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:31.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew the answer,

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:35.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you didn’t seem totally convinced

01:03:35.301 --> 01:03:37.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in here.

01:03:39.771 --> 01:03:41.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find that answer.

01:03:43.154 --> 01:03:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 6?

01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:47.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

01:03:50.296 --> 01:03:54.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But whoever practices sexual immorality

01:03:54.139 --> 01:03:57.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

01:04:01.407 --> 01:04:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure why,

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:08.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it made me think of Mum and Dad

01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:10.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(his constant cheating, actually),

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:13.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mum’s humiliation,

01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divorce, all the misery.

01:04:15.734 --> 01:04:17.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want that.

01:04:25.341 --> 01:04:27.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize

01:04:27.346 --> 01:04:30.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how right Jehovah is

01:04:30.144 --> 01:04:33.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what Neeta
called meditation.

01:04:33.987 --> 01:04:38.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about clearing your mind
to find inner peace;

01:04:38.206 --> 01:04:40.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s totally different.

01:04:41.505 --> 01:04:45.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s asking how Jehovah
feels about something

01:04:45.975 --> 01:04:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asking
what that means for me.

01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:58.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you notice in the video?

01:04:58.505 --> 01:05:02.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that Neeta showed
her Bible student the tools.

01:05:02.223 --> 01:05:04.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what more did she do?

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also helped her
to see that the answers

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not the most important thing.

01:05:10.284 --> 01:05:15.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most important thing was having
the information come to touch her heart

01:05:15.046 --> 01:05:19.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she would be moved to act
on what she learned.

01:05:19.265 --> 01:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we help our students

01:05:21.771 --> 01:05:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to feed themselves spiritually?

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:28.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, from the very beginning,
once the study has been established,

01:05:28.788 --> 01:05:33.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to teach our students
how to prepare each week for the study.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this might be
something very new to them,

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:41.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’re going to have to go through it
step-by-step, showing them how to prepare.

01:05:41.319 --> 01:05:44.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might also involve
having to help them see

01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:47.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they can buy out time
from their schedule

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can do
what’s necessary to prepare.

01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then don’t forget to commend them.

01:05:53.933 --> 01:05:57.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this might be
very new for many of our students,

01:05:57.233 --> 01:06:02.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they make the effort to prepare,
make sure you give appropriate commendation.

01:06:02.245 --> 01:06:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then what’s the next thing?

01:06:04.793 --> 01:06:07.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is something that we
sometimes forget, brothers.

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:11.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the need to teach our students to pray

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:14.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before every single study session.

01:06:14.149 --> 01:06:16.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is this important?

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:21.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, once again,
we want our students not just to be thinking

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:23.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of acquiring information

01:06:23.756 --> 01:06:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not to take
an academic approach to their study—

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:32.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead to be always thinking
about how what they’re studying

01:06:32.444 --> 01:06:36.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
connects them
with their heavenly Father, Jehovah,

01:06:36.204 --> 01:06:40.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they’re building up
a relationship with him.

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:42.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs chapter 2 says,

01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:46.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we call out to Jehovah
for knowledge, for wisdom,

01:06:46.771 --> 01:06:50.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for understanding,
Jehovah will help us.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help our student to gain
that knowledge that they need

01:06:53.538 --> 01:06:56.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build up a good relationship with him.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:59.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we want to do practical things.

01:06:59.511 --> 01:07:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to help our students
to become familiar

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:06.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the digital tools that we have
at our disposal for study.

01:07:06.653 --> 01:07:10.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means helping them
to install on their phone,

01:07:10.454 --> 01:07:14.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their tablet, or whatever device
they have <i>JW Library</i>®

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing them how to use
<i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i> ™

01:07:18.808 --> 01:07:22.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can get the answers
that they need to their questions.

01:07:22.734 --> 01:07:25.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know, as of February of this year,

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i>
is now available

01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:32.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more than 700 languages?

01:07:32.968 --> 01:07:36.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So people virtually all over the world

01:07:36.017 --> 01:07:39.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have access to these wonderful tools.

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:42.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t forget also to show them jw.org®

01:07:42.408 --> 01:07:46.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and JW Broadcasting® and show them
how they can keep up-to-date

01:07:46.919 --> 01:07:50.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these wonderful provisions from Jehovah.

01:07:50.302 --> 01:07:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, we’ve shown them
how to prepare for their lesson,

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve shown them
how to use the online tools,

01:07:57.236 --> 01:08:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what are the next progressive steps
we want to take

01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:03.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they
can feed themselves spiritually?

01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:07.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, as Psalm 1 tells us,

01:08:07.177 --> 01:08:11.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we want to be truly happy
and truly well-fed spiritually,

01:08:11.813 --> 01:08:14.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to “read [God’s] law

01:08:14.862 --> 01:08:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an undertone day and night.”

01:08:18.287 --> 01:08:21.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want to teach our students
to get into that good habit

01:08:21.796 --> 01:08:25.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of reading God’s Word,
the Bible, every day.

01:08:25.722 --> 01:08:28.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what about the next step?

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want our students also to be able

01:08:30.693 --> 01:08:33.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for congregation meetings.

01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:37.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we’ve shown them
how to use <i>JW Library,</i>

01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:39.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is really easy, isn’t it?

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:42.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we have to do
is basically hit that Meetings tab,

01:08:42.722 --> 01:08:45.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we do,
well, all the information

01:08:45.563 --> 01:08:50.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our midweek meeting
and our weekend meeting is all there for us.

01:08:50.324 --> 01:08:52.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help our student to see

01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:56.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this program of spiritual feeding

01:08:56.005 --> 01:09:00.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is something they can access
and something they can benefit from.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about research questions?

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers and sisters,
if you have a good student,

01:09:06.823 --> 01:09:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re going to be
asking lots of questions.

01:09:10.039 --> 01:09:13.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is where it’s sometimes
difficult for us as teachers.

01:09:13.924 --> 01:09:16.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would like to be able to just rush in,

01:09:16.555 --> 01:09:20.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open our Bible, and answer
every question that our student has.

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s the better course?

01:09:22.863 --> 01:09:24.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we want to be modest.

01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:28.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of answering
all the questions for them,

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much better it is
to go back to those tools!

01:09:32.595 --> 01:09:37.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to <i>JW Library,</i>
go back to <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY,</i>

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:41.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show the student
how they can find the answers

01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:43.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their own Bible questions.

01:09:43.956 --> 01:09:48.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we do that, we’re helping them
to build for the future.

01:09:48.634 --> 01:09:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers, if we can do this
—if we can accomplish this goal

01:09:53.605 --> 01:09:58.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of teaching our students
how to feed themselves spiritually

01:09:58.158 --> 01:10:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we are not just feeding them today.

01:10:00.873 --> 01:10:04.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not just
handing them a fish, as it were.

01:10:04.465 --> 01:10:07.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we’re teaching
them how to fish.

01:10:07.848 --> 01:10:10.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re teaching them
how to feed themselves

01:10:10.354 --> 01:10:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritually for a lifetime.

01:10:13.069 --> 01:10:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more important,

01:10:15.158 --> 01:10:18.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re fulfilling the commission
that Jesus gave us.

01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:22.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are making
real disciples of Christ Jesus,

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are well-fed spiritually.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:30.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as a result, they will not wither up
or they will not blow away,

01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:32.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead they will stand firm

01:10:32.868 --> 01:10:36.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as true disciples of Christ Jesus.

01:10:36.752 --> 01:10:40.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper with the Teaching Committee,

01:10:40.595 --> 01:10:43.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next talk in this symposium,

01:10:43.602 --> 01:10:47.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students
to . . . Attend Meetings.”

01:10:53.126 --> 01:10:56.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brings us great joy
to help our Bible students

01:10:56.551 --> 01:10:59.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feed themselves spiritually
so that they can continue

01:10:59.475 --> 01:11:01.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make spiritual progress

01:11:01.563 --> 01:11:04.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move ever closer to serving Jehovah.

01:11:05.698 --> 01:11:09.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual food that they digest
at their weekly Bible study

01:11:09.249 --> 01:11:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or their own personal research
is very beneficial.

01:11:12.548 --> 01:11:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It fills that spiritual need,
that void, in them.

01:11:16.224 --> 01:11:21.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also very appetizing,
much like eating an appetizer.

01:11:21.236 --> 01:11:26.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An appetizer is something that is served
before serving the main course.

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:30.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s meant to whet the appetite
before eating the main course.

01:11:30.969 --> 01:11:33.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you invited your Bible student

01:11:33.558 --> 01:11:37.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy the main course
of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall?

01:11:37.276 --> 01:11:40.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have, and they have seen their students 

01:11:40.409 --> 01:11:43.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
advance and really become happier.

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:45.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some have held back.

01:11:45.296 --> 01:11:48.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel that they don’t want
to rush their student into anything,

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:50.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put too much pressure on them.

01:11:50.893 --> 01:11:54.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is exactly what your student needs.

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:56.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Invite them as soon as possible.

01:11:56.531 --> 01:12:00.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never hold back because you could
possibly be holding them back

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:03.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from making progress.

01:12:03.382 --> 01:12:07.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about how the meetings have
helped you personally and your family.

01:12:07.559 --> 01:12:11.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about how the meetings
will help your student.

01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David knew that finding joy
and true happiness

01:12:14.952 --> 01:12:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only comes from drawing close to Jehovah

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worshipping Him at his house.

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:25.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what he says at Psalm 65:4.

01:12:26.146 --> 01:12:29.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Happy is the one whom you choose

01:12:29.571 --> 01:12:32.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bring near to reside in your courtyards.

01:12:32.578 --> 01:12:36.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We will be satisfied
 with the goodness of your house,

01:12:36.546 --> 01:12:38.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your holy temple.”

01:12:38.844 --> 01:12:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt your Bible student
is happy with their Bible study

01:12:43.731 --> 01:12:45.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they’re learning about Jehovah.

01:12:45.777 --> 01:12:47.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have deep gratitude.

01:12:47.782 --> 01:12:50.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is gratitude?

01:12:50.038 --> 01:12:54.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gratitude means “appreciating
what kindness is shown to you.”

01:12:54.925 --> 01:12:59.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it also means “showing appreciation
and returning kindness.”

01:12:59.937 --> 01:13:04.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worshipping Jehovah
is how we return kindness,

01:13:04.323 --> 01:13:07.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show our appreciation and our gratitude.

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:10.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do this, Jehovah is happy,

01:13:10.922 --> 01:13:13.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which makes us happy as well.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:18.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in the following dramatization
how Neeta

01:13:18.065 --> 01:13:21.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invites her Bible study,
Jade, to attend meetings.

01:13:23.244 --> 01:13:25.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah,

01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:28.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister died in that attack;
it was really sad.

01:13:28.967 --> 01:13:31.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s “time and unexpected events”?

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:36.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s one of those cases where . . .

01:13:36.193 --> 01:13:38.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about when someone survives
because they’re at the meeting?

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s, um—

01:13:40.829 --> 01:13:42.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t get it.

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:46.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Straight answer
—Does Jehovah protect Witnesses or not?

01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:48.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s funny.

01:13:48.097 --> 01:13:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

01:13:50.812 --> 01:13:52.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

01:13:52.859 --> 01:13:55.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re really pushing those meetings,
aren’t you?

01:13:58.873 --> 01:14:01.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What time?

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:01.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe I missed her part,

01:15:01.903 --> 01:15:05.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t a total loss.

01:15:11.009 --> 01:15:14.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta had said, “At the Hall,
everyone loves one another.”

01:15:18.903 --> 01:15:23.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until I’d felt it, I had no idea.

01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told her I’d be back.

01:15:31.058 --> 01:15:34.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jade feel when she
attended her first meeting?

01:15:34.358 --> 01:15:38.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, she really enjoyed it, and she
remembered what Neeta told her

01:15:38.326 --> 01:15:41.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that everyone at the Kingdom Hall
loves one another,’

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:43.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jade had to admit,

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But until I’d felt it, I had no idea.”

01:15:47.223 --> 01:15:48.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could’ve read it.

01:15:48.726 --> 01:15:50.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could’ve heard about it.

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:53.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until she was there and feeling the love—

01:15:53.822 --> 01:15:56.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to come back.

01:15:56.078 --> 01:15:58.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, attending meetings goes hand-in-hand

01:15:58.542 --> 01:16:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with making spiritual progress.

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:05.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As much as they love their
home Bible study, it’s like an appetizer.

01:16:05.183 --> 01:16:08.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one part
of the spiritual feeding program

01:16:08.692 --> 01:16:11.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah provides at the Kingdom Hall

01:16:11.741 --> 01:16:15.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that main course provided
through the faithful slave.

01:16:15.751 --> 01:16:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during each Bible study, it would be
good to explain to your student

01:16:20.095 --> 01:16:22.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what has affected you, what impacted you,

01:16:22.935 --> 01:16:25.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help make wise decisions,
what encouraged you.

01:16:25.901 --> 01:16:29.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share it with them, and share a point
that would help them.

01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, whet their appetite.

01:16:31.414 --> 01:16:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pique their interest.

01:16:33.336 --> 01:16:37.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they come to the meeting,
they will see true Christian love,

01:16:37.555 --> 01:16:40.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unfailing love in action.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will see others
trying to put into action,

01:16:43.319 --> 01:16:46.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying, what they’re
learning at the meetings.

01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:49.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will make true friends
that will help support them

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:52.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help them to progress spiritually.

01:16:52.926 --> 01:16:55.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attending meetings can be a bit intimidating

01:16:55.682 --> 01:16:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some and cause some anxiety,

01:16:57.854 --> 01:17:02.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’d be good to explain to them what
they might expect when they attend.

01:17:02.867 --> 01:17:06.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the best ways
to do this is showing them a video

01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:10.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled <i>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</i>

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will really put them at ease

01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really help them have less anxiety

01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:17.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they do finally come.

01:17:17.778 --> 01:17:19.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’d be good to also invite others

01:17:19.908 --> 01:17:22.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Bible study so that when your student

01:17:22.122 --> 01:17:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does finally make it to the meeting,

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:29.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will see many familiar faces
and feel much more comfortable.

01:17:29.056 --> 01:17:31.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let the friends in the congregation know

01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:33.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your student is coming to the meeting

01:17:33.525 --> 01:17:36.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when they walk through the door,
they can come over,

01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:39.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give them a warm welcome,
make them feel comfortable.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Neeta did for Jade,
and it worked so well.

01:17:43.049 --> 01:17:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped her to progress.

01:17:45.931 --> 01:17:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your student is a guest in Jehovah’s house.

01:17:49.105 --> 01:17:52.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make them feel special,
and make them feel comfortable

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by offering practical help before the meeting

01:17:55.621 --> 01:17:57.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as during the meeting.

01:17:57.918 --> 01:17:59.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, well in advance,

01:17:59.965 --> 01:18:03.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whet their appetite on what they
will learn once they come to the meeting.

01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:05.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like showing them a menu

01:18:05.771 --> 01:18:09.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they will enjoy
with the main course at the meeting.

01:18:09.906 --> 01:18:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Offer to provide a ride to your students

01:18:13.749 --> 01:18:16.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have them sit with you at the meetings.

01:18:16.756 --> 01:18:19.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would also be good to make sure
that they have the publications

01:18:19.973 --> 01:18:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be discussed at the meeting,

01:18:22.019 --> 01:18:25.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either hardcopy or have it downloaded
on their device.

01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:29.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we have discussed, attending meetings

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:33.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoying the main course
of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall

01:18:33.213 --> 01:18:36.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help your student in so many ways.

01:18:36.095 --> 01:18:40.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will make them feel happier,
help them to continue progressing,

01:18:40.147 --> 01:18:42.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can draw close to Jehovah.

01:18:42.862 --> 01:18:46.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul
gives us some more indications

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what your student can enjoy.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:50.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please notice with me

01:18:50.088 --> 01:18:53.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he says at Colossians 2:7.

01:18:54.725 --> 01:18:57.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in verse 6 that they
should ‘keep on walking.’

01:18:57.356 --> 01:18:59.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in verse 7,

01:18:59.319 --> 01:19:03.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they should be “rooted
and built up in him [Jesus]

01:19:03.162 --> 01:19:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and being stabilized in the faith,
just as you were taught,

01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:10.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overflowing with thanksgiving.”

01:19:10.096 --> 01:19:12.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So their appreciation, their gratitude

01:19:12.518 --> 01:19:16.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they will want to go
to the meetings and worship Jehovah.

01:19:16.570 --> 01:19:21.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So continue to find joy in helping
your student feed themselves spiritually,

01:19:21.415 --> 01:19:26.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also help them to appreciate
attending meetings on a weekly basis.

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:30.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it a way of life for them
so that they can enjoy everlasting life.

01:19:32.359 --> 01:19:35.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook,
a member of the Governing Body,

01:19:35.324 --> 01:19:37.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next part of this symposium

01:19:37.914 --> 01:19:42.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Help Your Bible Students to . . .
Avoid Bad Associations.”

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:53.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, let’s illustrate the importance
of helping our Bible students

01:19:53.494 --> 01:19:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid bad association,

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:59.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll use the example
of a prospector.

01:19:59.509 --> 01:20:02.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a prospector
finds something valuable

01:20:02.641 --> 01:20:05.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deep underground,
what does he do?

01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:08.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must make certain
that the way in is secured

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that it’s well supported.

01:20:10.369 --> 01:20:13.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, the treasure
might be plundered

01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the way in could collapse.

01:20:16.216 --> 01:20:19.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is similar to what
we must be aware of when it comes

01:20:19.307 --> 01:20:21.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to helping our Bible students.

01:20:21.354 --> 01:20:25.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work hard to reach the hearts
of responsive ones, don’t we?

01:20:25.405 --> 01:20:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do, with Jehovah’s help,

01:20:28.037 --> 01:20:32.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we continue assisting them
to secure and protect their hearts.

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:37.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes protecting
their growing faith in Jehovah.

01:20:37.059 --> 01:20:41.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, the Devil
will ruin what has been done

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:43.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strip them of their faith.

01:20:43.575 --> 01:20:47.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we are to help our students to progress,

01:20:47.084 --> 01:20:52.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must keep in mind why avoiding
bad associations is so important.

01:20:52.054 --> 01:20:54.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must also have in mind

01:20:54.602 --> 01:20:58.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we can help
our students to do this.

01:20:58.236 --> 01:21:02.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s first look at why
this is so important.

01:21:02.162 --> 01:21:05.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order for your Bible students
to gain Jehovah’s friendship,

01:21:05.922 --> 01:21:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will likely need to make some changes
in their choice of association.

01:21:09.973 --> 01:21:11.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:21:11.978 --> 01:21:15.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because your student’s progress
is greatly affected

01:21:15.654 --> 01:21:18.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by his or her choice of friends.

01:21:18.243 --> 01:21:23.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 13:20
explains why this is true.

01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:27.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to that verse,
Proverbs 13:20.

01:21:27.057 --> 01:21:29.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

01:21:29.103 --> 01:21:32.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise,

01:21:32.696 --> 01:21:37.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one who has dealings
with the stupid will fare badly.”

01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:41.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does a person’s choice
of associates matter?

01:21:41.676 --> 01:21:44.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we cannot change
what the verse says here

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“The one [who is] walking . . . 
[or] has dealings with the stupid

01:21:48.777 --> 01:21:50.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will fare badly.”

01:21:50.782 --> 01:21:54.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that our friends affect us

01:21:54.666 --> 01:21:57.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in either a good way
or a bad way, don’t they?

01:21:57.548 --> 01:22:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hebrew language,
to have “dealings with” someone

01:22:01.642 --> 01:22:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can mean to “keep company” with a person,

01:22:04.231 --> 01:22:07.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, to be friends with a person.

01:22:07.239 --> 01:22:11.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a Bible student seeks company
with senseless people,

01:22:11.123 --> 01:22:13.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she will not progress spiritually.

01:22:13.755 --> 01:22:17.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it’s so important
to help our Bible students

01:22:17.305 --> 01:22:21.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid the problems
that come with bad association.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:25.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, from Proverbs 13:20,

01:22:25.158 --> 01:22:29.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn that “the one walking
with the wise will become wise.”

01:22:29.627 --> 01:22:32.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the idea of walking with someone

01:22:32.676 --> 01:22:36.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves choosing
to spend time with a person.

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:40.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So help your Bible students
to choose well.

01:22:40.028 --> 01:22:42.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wholesome associates in the truth

01:22:42.325 --> 01:22:44.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help your students to break free

01:22:44.664 --> 01:22:48.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from worldly thinking and unclean practices.

01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:52.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this in mind, now that we
have considered why we must help them,

01:22:52.809 --> 01:22:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look some more
at how we can do so.

01:22:56.150 --> 01:23:01.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
note how Neeta helps her Bibles student

01:23:01.163 --> 01:23:05.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seek out and select
good associates or friends.

01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:10.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

01:23:10.644 --> 01:23:14.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:20.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, but what are good associations?

01:23:20.126 --> 01:23:22.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have wholesome gatherings

01:23:22.256 --> 01:23:25.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brothers and sisters
from the congregation,

01:23:25.264 --> 01:23:27.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we eat and talk.

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:31.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some like to play musical instruments,
and they’ll do

01:23:31.111 --> 01:23:34.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
renditions of original songs.

01:23:41.721 --> 01:23:44.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have a really nice time.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t do that.

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:49.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not boring.

01:23:49.239 --> 01:23:51.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure it’s not.

01:23:51.077 --> 01:23:53.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do you do?

01:24:15.094 --> 01:24:17.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you wouldn’t do that.

01:24:17.976 --> 01:24:20.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not exactly wholesome.

01:24:20.858 --> 01:24:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you have to have fun, right?

01:24:22.905 --> 01:24:26.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, and we do.

01:24:26.205 --> 01:24:28.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See for yourself.

01:24:28.251 --> 01:24:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m having some people
over this weekend.

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:32.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

01:25:05.175 --> 01:25:07.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t the club,

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:11.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was still fun.

01:25:13.237 --> 01:25:18.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you take note of how Neeta helped
her Bible student to seek good friends?

01:25:18.249 --> 01:25:22.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing,
she was empathetic, wasn’t she?

01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:26.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta understood that her Bible student
would need to see

01:25:26.352 --> 01:25:30.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience
some things for herself.

01:25:30.028 --> 01:25:33.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, she invited her student

01:25:33.077 --> 01:25:35.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a gathering of brothers and sisters,

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:40.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the impact
of that positive experience was obvious.

01:25:40.345 --> 01:25:44.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, when it comes
to how we can help our Bible students,

01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:47.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to be empathetic as well.

01:25:47.488 --> 01:25:50.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us naturally desire to have friends.

01:25:50.537 --> 01:25:54.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep that in mind
as you strive to help your students.

01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be difficult for them
to seek out good associates.

01:25:58.013 --> 01:26:01.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, this is all new for them.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Added to this,

01:26:03.527 --> 01:26:08.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as your students accept
and apply Bible standards in their lives,

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:11.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of their former friends
will likely reject them.

01:26:11.505 --> 01:26:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can prepare them for this

01:26:13.719 --> 01:26:16.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing them what the Bible says,

01:26:16.225 --> 01:26:20.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example, at 1 Peter 4:4.

01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:24.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that verse, we are made aware
that people would be “puzzled”

01:26:24.119 --> 01:26:28.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the changes we make
in order to please Jehovah.

01:26:28.421 --> 01:26:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also tells us that people
might “speak abusively” of us

01:26:33.016 --> 01:26:35.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reject our changes.

01:26:35.647 --> 01:26:39.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could even include
members of one’s own family,

01:26:39.156 --> 01:26:43.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that fact might be difficult
for your students to accept.

01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:46.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you help your students
at a time like that?

01:26:46.883 --> 01:26:50.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By giving them a real choice.

01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:54.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with helping them
to draw close to Jehovah,

01:26:54.318 --> 01:26:59.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help your students to replace
bad associations with good ones.

01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:01.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be a friend to your students.

01:27:01.795 --> 01:27:05.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Introduce them
to others in the congregation.

01:27:05.304 --> 01:27:09.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, whenever possible,
when the study is over,

01:27:09.481 --> 01:27:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not stay for a while,
talk with them, spend some time,

01:27:13.783 --> 01:27:16.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really get to know them?

01:27:16.247 --> 01:27:19.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call your student
whenever he or she is sick.

01:27:19.881 --> 01:27:21.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show personal interest.

01:27:21.969 --> 01:27:24.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sit with them at the meetings,
and invite others

01:27:24.852 --> 01:27:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sit in on the study with you.

01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:30.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as illustrated in the video,
like Neeta,

01:27:30.657 --> 01:27:35.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
include your student
in upbuilding social activities.

01:27:35.169 --> 01:27:38.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One formerly unbelieving husband,
who is now an elder,

01:27:38.928 --> 01:27:41.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recalls how a brother helped him.

01:27:41.476 --> 01:27:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that the brother
took a day off from work

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to watch a ball game with him,

01:27:46.697 --> 01:27:50.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he thought to himself,
‘He’s normal.’

01:27:50.874 --> 01:27:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also important to help
your Bible student understand

01:27:55.218 --> 01:28:00.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that bad association
is not limited to morally debased people.

01:28:00.147 --> 01:28:03.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that “the whole world

01:28:03.697 --> 01:28:06.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[the whole world] is lying

01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:09.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the power of the wicked one.”

01:28:09.085 --> 01:28:12.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, kindly help your students to see

01:28:12.552 --> 01:28:15.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must also avoid association

01:28:15.559 --> 01:28:18.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with those who may appear to be morally clean

01:28:18.567 --> 01:28:22.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who lack faith in the true God Jehovah.

01:28:22.827 --> 01:28:27.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of these ways,
we see why we must help

01:28:27.004 --> 01:28:29.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can help our Bible students

01:28:29.594 --> 01:28:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid bad associations
and accept good ones.

01:28:33.812 --> 01:28:38.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we must help them
to secure the way into their heart

01:28:38.783 --> 01:28:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and protect their faith.

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:45.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your students do this
by avoiding bad associations,

01:28:45.048 --> 01:28:49.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will no doubt gain
many lifelong friends, including you.

01:28:49.894 --> 01:28:53.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whether your student is a family member

01:28:53.026 --> 01:28:55.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or someone you meet in the ministry,

01:28:55.449 --> 01:28:58.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will both have precious memories

01:28:58.206 --> 01:29:01.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and joy that will last forever.

01:29:02.884 --> 01:29:06.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris,
a member of the Governing Body,

01:29:06.392 --> 01:29:09.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

01:29:09.943 --> 01:29:14.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students
to . . . Overcome Unclean Habits.”

01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this part of our symposium,

01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:28.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are addressing why and how

01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:33.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our Bible students
overcome unclean habits.

01:29:34.754 --> 01:29:39.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first of all,
why overcome unclean habits?

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:44.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As teachers, we need to reach the heart
of those we study with,

01:29:44.235 --> 01:29:47.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand that the God we worship

01:29:47.452 --> 01:29:50.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expects this to stop.

01:29:50.584 --> 01:29:53.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me show you a verse
that you’re familiar with,

01:29:53.592 --> 01:29:58.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of you, in Peter’s letter
—1 Peter chapter one.

01:29:58.061 --> 01:30:02.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we could use these thoughts here

01:30:02.447 --> 01:30:05.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endeavor to reach the heart
of those who we’re studying with,

01:30:05.997 --> 01:30:10.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why this unclean habit must stop.

01:30:10.007 --> 01:30:13.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 14 through 16:

01:30:13.265 --> 01:30:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As obedient children, stop being molded

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the desires
you formerly had in your ignorance,

01:30:21.452 --> 01:30:24.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but like the Holy One who called you,

01:30:24.501 --> 01:30:29.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become holy yourselves in all your conduct,

01:30:29.346 --> 01:30:33.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for it is written:
‘You must be holy,

01:30:33.231 --> 01:30:35.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I am holy.’”

01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:37.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s very clear here.

01:30:37.575 --> 01:30:39.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are things

01:30:39.621 --> 01:30:43.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our Bible studies practiced before

01:30:43.924 --> 01:30:48.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these unclean habits in their ignorance,
before they knew Jehovah,

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:51.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they knew his requirements.

01:30:51.442 --> 01:30:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to understand he is the Holy One,

01:30:54.867 --> 01:30:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have to have their conduct line up

01:30:58.334 --> 01:31:01.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Holy One that we worship.

01:31:01.132 --> 01:31:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is not a suggestion,

01:31:03.346 --> 01:31:08.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as quoting the scripture
here in verse 16, it’s a must.

01:31:08.066 --> 01:31:13.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must be holy because Jehovah is holy.

01:31:13.078 --> 01:31:16.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in the following dramatization,

01:31:16.963 --> 01:31:20.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Neeta helps her Bible student

01:31:20.513 --> 01:31:24.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome an unclean habit.

01:31:39.978 --> 01:31:42.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta and I talked about it.

01:31:42.567 --> 01:31:45.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of me felt a bit scared,

01:31:45.742 --> 01:31:47.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
part a bit crazy.

01:31:47.705 --> 01:31:49.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me knocking on doors?

01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:55.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew
this was the right thing to do.

01:31:55.641 --> 01:31:57.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A minister should also be free

01:31:57.354 --> 01:31:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘from all nonmedical use of addictive

01:31:59.776 --> 01:32:02.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or mind-altering substances.’

01:32:02.575 --> 01:32:04.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonmedical?

01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:10.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking something
when I’m feeling a little stressed,

01:32:10.344 --> 01:32:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like maybe, I don’t know, a little weed

01:32:17.486 --> 01:32:19.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s OK, right?

01:32:21.079 --> 01:32:23.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s for the stress.

01:32:27.052 --> 01:32:30.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I didn’t quite understand
what “medical” meant.

01:32:30.017 --> 01:32:32.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will we see you during the week?

01:32:32.022 --> 01:32:33.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

01:32:33.066 --> 01:32:34.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jade.

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:38.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be back.

01:32:38.079 --> 01:32:40.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can guess what
our next few studies were about.

01:32:40.418 --> 01:32:43.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue
to be made new

01:32:43.926 --> 01:32:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing it was wrong was easy.

01:32:51.111 --> 01:32:55.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Figuring out how to cope
without it wasn’t.

01:33:05.563 --> 01:33:09.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beating it

01:33:09.155 --> 01:33:11.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt impossible.

01:33:29.705 --> 01:33:34.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being free of it
to serve Jehovah

01:33:34.384 --> 01:33:36.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt amazing!

01:33:44.283 --> 01:33:48.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s discuss the “how to help.”

01:33:48.167 --> 01:33:51.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see how our Sister Neeta

01:33:51.217 --> 01:33:53.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endeavored to help her Bible student

01:33:53.472 --> 01:33:55.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she became aware of that unclean habit.

01:33:55.978 --> 01:33:57.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are some nice thoughts

01:33:57.983 --> 01:34:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to how to help our Bible students

01:34:01.617 --> 01:34:04.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcome unclean habits.

01:34:04.207 --> 01:34:07.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we want to be candid

01:34:07.674 --> 01:34:09.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and clear from the Scriptures,

01:34:09.804 --> 01:34:12.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but always remember,
we need to be warm

01:34:12.394 --> 01:34:16.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to be tactful with them.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These habits have a grip on them,

01:34:18.701 --> 01:34:23.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to display
not a judgmental attitude but patience

01:34:23.504 --> 01:34:26.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, really, just imitating Jehovah,

01:34:26.511 --> 01:34:30.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping them to apply Bible counsel.

01:34:30.104 --> 01:34:33.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s important for the teacher
to understand what we’re going to share

01:34:33.612 --> 01:34:37.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with you next,
and then, if you have it clear,

01:34:37.288 --> 01:34:41.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be able
to impart it to your Bible student.

01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:44.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read a familiar scripture

01:34:44.263 --> 01:34:47.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ephesians chapter 4.

01:34:47.605 --> 01:34:50.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s important to understand

01:34:50.738 --> 01:34:52.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we read here

01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:54.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as related to helping them

01:34:54.998 --> 01:34:58.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcome unclean habits

01:34:58.757 --> 01:35:02.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that go contrary to Bible principles.

01:35:02.349 --> 01:35:04.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice in Ephesians chapter 4,

01:35:04.981 --> 01:35:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 22, 23, and 24:

01:35:09.492 --> 01:35:13.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You were taught
to put away the old personality

01:35:13.335 --> 01:35:17.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that conforms
to your former course of conduct

01:35:17.219 --> 01:35:21.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that is being corrupted
according to its [that’s the old personality]

01:35:21.522 --> 01:35:23.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“deceptive desires.

01:35:23.986 --> 01:35:27.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

01:35:27.244 --> 01:35:29.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in your dominant mental attitude,

01:35:29.708 --> 01:35:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and should put on the new personality

01:35:32.047 --> 01:35:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was created according to God’s will

01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:39.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in true righteousness and loyalty.”

01:35:39.106 --> 01:35:43.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to understand this clearly,

01:35:43.325 --> 01:35:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we need to teach our students.

01:35:45.748 --> 01:35:47.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s the old personality.

01:35:47.878 --> 01:35:51.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those of us that came in the truth
had old personalities.

01:35:51.804 --> 01:35:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know exactly what Paul
is writing to the Ephesians about

01:35:56.775 --> 01:35:59.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that’s a former course of conduct

01:35:59.699 --> 01:36:02.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is no longer acceptable.

01:36:02.288 --> 01:36:06.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the key to being able
to put on the new personality

01:36:06.465 --> 01:36:10.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put away the old one
is found in verse 23:

01:36:10.934 --> 01:36:15.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be made new
in your dominant mental attitude.”

01:36:15.028 --> 01:36:18.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does that mean?

01:36:18.453 --> 01:36:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means your
Bible students’ thinking

01:36:22.672 --> 01:36:25.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to change.

01:36:25.011 --> 01:36:30.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thinking has to change
into this new personality

01:36:30.023 --> 01:36:34.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—thinking that’s guided and directed
by Jehovah and his Word.

01:36:34.826 --> 01:36:38.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to illustrate what I mean by that,

01:36:38.753 --> 01:36:43.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you a personal experience
with a Bible study that I had many years ago,

01:36:43.765 --> 01:36:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really appreciated
how Jehovah helped him.

01:36:48.151 --> 01:36:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I studied with him, he was 70,

01:36:51.994 --> 01:36:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
early 70’s, and he had smoked cigarettes

01:36:57.006 --> 01:36:59.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since he was eight years old.

01:36:59.011 --> 01:37:01.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s phenomenal.

01:37:01.392 --> 01:37:05.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked before I became
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:37:05.234 --> 01:37:07.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But decades?

01:37:07.406 --> 01:37:08.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:37:08.743 --> 01:37:13.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So smoking had a grip on him,
that old personality,

01:37:13.463 --> 01:37:16.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was very discouraging
and difficult for him.

01:37:16.972 --> 01:37:21.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he was making progress,
coming to meetings.

01:37:21.524 --> 01:37:25.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this one example
that happened with his life

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will illustrate the point we’re making here.

01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:32.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m working in a department
there at the convention,

01:37:32.092 --> 01:37:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s near the lobby area.

01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:38.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I notice my Bible study head out,

01:37:38.483 --> 01:37:40.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the program is ongoing.

01:37:40.488 --> 01:37:42.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He heads out the door.

01:37:42.367 --> 01:37:45.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And out of personal interest
(not to police him)

01:37:45.166 --> 01:37:48.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to go see; is he OK?

01:37:48.549 --> 01:37:50.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he’s about a block down

01:37:50.805 --> 01:37:53.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the lobby of the convention center,

01:37:53.812 --> 01:37:55.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you know what?

01:37:55.859 --> 01:37:58.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smoking a cigarette.

01:37:58.615 --> 01:38:01.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he notices me come up behind him,

01:38:01.456 --> 01:38:04.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just hits him, and he’s contrite.

01:38:04.839 --> 01:38:06.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The shame is all in his face,

01:38:06.969 --> 01:38:10.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he throws that cigarette down
and stomps it with his shoe.

01:38:10.812 --> 01:38:13.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I get close to him, he says:

01:38:13.694 --> 01:38:17.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I just— I’ve been asking Jehovah,
‘Forgive me; forgive me.’

01:38:17.662 --> 01:38:20.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When this happens,
I always ask him to forgive me.”

01:38:20.878 --> 01:38:23.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said: “Well, that’s commendable.

01:38:23.385 --> 01:38:26.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s so important.
I know you love Jehovah.

01:38:26.392 --> 01:38:29.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, here’s what you need to learn.

01:38:29.399 --> 01:38:34.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“See, you need to approach Jehovah before,

01:38:34.412 --> 01:38:37.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplicate him

01:38:37.252 --> 01:38:40.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you take that cigarette.”

01:38:40.969 --> 01:38:43.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where
our Bible students need help.

01:38:43.643 --> 01:38:48.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important that they
have to supplicate Jehovah

01:38:48.028 --> 01:38:51.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before that unclean habit overwhelms them.

01:38:51.579 --> 01:38:55.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m happy to say he did.

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:57.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned his back on that.

01:38:57.677 --> 01:38:59.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He supplicated Jehovah.

01:38:59.724 --> 01:39:02.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And boy, imagine smoking all those decades,

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:06.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he died a faithful servant
of Jehovah God.

01:39:06.992 --> 01:39:10.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So help your Bible students.

01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:14.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep that in mind;
they have to change their thinking,

01:39:14.218 --> 01:39:16.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s our responsibility
to make that clear to them.

01:39:16.933 --> 01:39:21.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, teach them too
by means of practical assistance.

01:39:21.903 --> 01:39:26.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be a dear friend for them;
stay there for them.

01:39:26.164 --> 01:39:30.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be available when they need help
with something, and just love them.

01:39:30.633 --> 01:39:32.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be judgmental.

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:37.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be supportive, and help them
to overcome these unclean habits.

01:39:37.692 --> 01:39:41.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And very important,
teach them,

01:39:41.535 --> 01:39:44.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not give up.’
Jehovah loves you.

01:39:44.667 --> 01:39:47.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He wants you to rejoice
in the progress you’re making.

01:39:47.925 --> 01:39:49.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loves you.”

01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:51.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what you’ll experience

01:39:51.893 --> 01:39:54.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they become a dedicated Witness,

01:39:54.817 --> 01:39:57.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your fellow servant of God,

01:39:57.073 --> 01:40:00.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have a friend forever.

01:40:02.419 --> 01:40:07.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, next on our symposium, the final talk,

01:40:07.306 --> 01:40:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson,

01:40:09.812 --> 01:40:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
is going to consider the talk

01:40:12.987 --> 01:40:15.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students to Develop

01:40:15.827 --> 01:40:19.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Personal Relationship With Jehovah.”

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does a father feel

01:40:28.901 --> 01:40:32.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he receives
an unexpected gift from his child?

01:40:32.702 --> 01:40:35.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, his heart is warmed.

01:40:35.375 --> 01:40:37.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:40:37.422 --> 01:40:42.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he sees this
as an expression of the child’s love for him.

01:40:42.309 --> 01:40:46.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way,
our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah,

01:40:46.903 --> 01:40:49.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not want
to force us to serve him.

01:40:49.744 --> 01:40:52.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s interested in our motives,

01:40:52.333 --> 01:40:56.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to serve him out of love.

01:40:56.009 --> 01:40:58.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:40:58.014 --> 01:41:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah
realizes that love has power.

01:41:02.191 --> 01:41:05.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives us the power
to make changes in our life.

01:41:05.658 --> 01:41:07.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, it helps us

01:41:07.913 --> 01:41:11.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to overcome
temptations and opposition.

01:41:13.302 --> 01:41:17.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that presents a challenge for us
when we’re conducting Bible studies.

01:41:17.437 --> 01:41:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

01:41:19.442 --> 01:41:24.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we develop
within the hearts of the Bible students

01:41:24.454 --> 01:41:26.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a love for Jehovah

01:41:26.751 --> 01:41:30.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without forcing them
or trying to put pressure on them?

01:41:31.805 --> 01:41:35.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s something
that we need to think about.

01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:40.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these talks, we’ve certainly enjoyed
this series of videos—haven’t we?—

01:41:40.243 --> 01:41:44.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have helped us to see
how Jade has made progress

01:41:44.628 --> 01:41:49.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with her Bible study and how Neeta
has helped her all along.

01:41:49.056 --> 01:41:52.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about this, we see

01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:55.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jade has made good progress

01:41:55.405 --> 01:41:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she’s up to a point now

01:41:57.953 --> 01:42:01.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where she has a love for Jehovah.

01:42:01.002 --> 01:42:05.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this final video, let’s watch how Jade

01:42:05.847 --> 01:42:08.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faces a very difficult problem

01:42:08.479 --> 01:42:12.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll see how her love for Jehovah
helps her to overcome this problem.

01:42:14.577 --> 01:42:16.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Mum, listen.

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jade, you listen!

01:42:19.005 --> 01:42:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t this just another
one of your phases?

01:42:21.344 --> 01:42:23.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to move on, Love.

01:42:24.685 --> 01:42:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holidays are our time.

01:42:27.358 --> 01:42:29.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all I get from you.

01:42:29.363 --> 01:42:31.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise me you’ll be here.

01:42:34.334 --> 01:42:36.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise!

01:42:50.624 --> 01:42:53.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really don’t want to disappoint her,

01:42:53.506 --> 01:42:56.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t disappoint Jehovah.

01:42:56.471 --> 01:42:58.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

01:42:58.309 --> 01:43:00.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You love them both.

01:43:00.272 --> 01:43:02.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you think he can help you?

01:43:04.324 --> 01:43:06.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to him.

01:43:11.717 --> 01:43:15.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent a long time
pouring out my heart to him.

01:43:23.329 --> 01:43:26.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remembered something
from one of the Psalms:

01:43:32.351 --> 01:43:35.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will walk in your truth.

01:43:35.317 --> 01:43:39.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart
to fear your name.”

01:44:28.197 --> 01:44:30.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

01:44:33.919 --> 01:44:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember someone once claiming
to be “all about the promises.”

01:44:37.386 --> 01:44:39.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Made any good ones lately?

01:44:39.433 --> 01:44:41.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

01:44:46.909 --> 01:44:49.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that certainly was
a difficult problem, wasn’t it?

01:44:49.749 --> 01:44:54.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her mother wanted to force her
to join her in a worldly holiday.

01:44:55.681 --> 01:44:57.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped Jade?

01:44:57.853 --> 01:45:01.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As she said, it’s true
that she loves her mother

01:45:01.236 --> 01:45:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she didn’t want
to disappoint Jehovah.

01:45:04.494 --> 01:45:08.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, Neeta didn’t try to go through
all the pros and cons with her.

01:45:08.963 --> 01:45:11.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She realized that Jade
had a love for Jehovah,

01:45:11.971 --> 01:45:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she just simply said,
‘Ask him for help.’

01:45:15.396 --> 01:45:18.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah did help her.

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:23.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we make sure
that our Bible students

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:27.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to a similar point in their life,
where they love Jehovah?

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we find some help
with regard to that question

01:45:30.725 --> 01:45:32.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we turn to the first book of John.

01:45:32.981 --> 01:45:37.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, please, turn with me
to 1 John chapter 4,

01:45:37.659 --> 01:45:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 8:

01:45:42.045 --> 01:45:46.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever does not love
has not come to know God,

01:45:46.305 --> 01:45:49.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because God is love.”

01:45:49.062 --> 01:45:51.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is this telling us?

01:45:51.443 --> 01:45:55.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, basically, it is saying
that if our Bible student

01:45:55.035 --> 01:45:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t love God,

01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s because they
haven’t really come to know God yet.

01:46:00.715 --> 01:46:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we turn the page to verse 19,

01:46:04.224 --> 01:46:06.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a secondary point that’s mentioned.

01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:08.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “We love,

01:46:08.944 --> 01:46:12.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he first loved us.”

01:46:12.452 --> 01:46:15.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this highlight?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for our Bible student to love Jehovah,

01:46:18.175 --> 01:46:21.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they need to come to know him
but also they need

01:46:21.934 --> 01:46:25.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see his love in their lives.

01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that puts a responsibility on us

01:46:28.116 --> 01:46:31.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them to identify Jehovah’s love

01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:35.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then have this love
for Jehovah build in their hearts.

01:46:35.509 --> 01:46:38.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do that by asking questions, such as:

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How have you seen
Jehovah’s love in your life?”

01:46:41.315 --> 01:46:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “What does this Bible account
teach us about Jehovah’s love?”

01:46:45.868 --> 01:46:50.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, although we
are interested in explaining

01:46:50.462 --> 01:46:54.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah has done
by highlighting what he does,

01:46:54.222 --> 01:46:56.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he does it, and when he does it,

01:46:56.477 --> 01:46:59.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never want
to forget the vital question:

01:46:59.861 --> 01:47:02.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does he do something?

01:47:02.367 --> 01:47:05.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is, because of his love.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we help our Bible student to see that.

01:47:08.674 --> 01:47:13.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah’s power
enables him to do things.

01:47:13.519 --> 01:47:16.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wisdom helps him and guides him,

01:47:16.526 --> 01:47:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with justice,
to do things the right way.

01:47:20.494 --> 01:47:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is it that motivates Jehovah?

01:47:24.295 --> 01:47:26.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s his love, isn’t it?

01:47:26.635 --> 01:47:30.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And asking the question
why Jehovah does things

01:47:30.227 --> 01:47:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps to highlight that point.

01:47:32.608 --> 01:47:37.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we’re teaching our Bible students,
we need them to see

01:47:37.495 --> 01:47:39.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really does love them

01:47:39.959 --> 01:47:43.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants them
to succeed in their life.

01:47:43.509 --> 01:47:46.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we could perhaps share with them

01:47:46.015 --> 01:47:50.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the times when we personally
have experienced Jehovah’s love

01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:54.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps in the way
that Jehovah has answered our prayers.

01:47:54.077 --> 01:47:58.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in connection with this,
there’s another scripture that can help us.

01:47:58.797 --> 01:48:02.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to the book of Isaiah

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:06.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 48,
and we’re going to look 

01:48:06.399 --> 01:48:10.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at verses 17 and 18.

01:48:10.952 --> 01:48:15.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17, 18:

01:48:15.964 --> 01:48:19.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,
your Repurchaser,

01:48:19.723 --> 01:48:24.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Holy One of Israel:
‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

01:48:24.067 --> 01:48:27.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:48:27.618 --> 01:48:31.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.

01:48:31.210 --> 01:48:35.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If only you would pay attention
to my commandments!

01:48:35.094 --> 01:48:38.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Then your peace would become
just like a river

01:48:38.561 --> 01:48:43.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your righteousness
like the waves of the sea.’”

01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the point
that’s being made here?

01:48:46.288 --> 01:48:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to help
our Bible students to understand

01:48:50.006 --> 01:48:52.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really wants the best for them

01:48:52.888 --> 01:48:57.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s helping and guiding them
in the way that they should go.

01:48:57.148 --> 01:49:00.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the end result
—we notice there in verse 18—

01:49:00.657 --> 01:49:04.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that peace and righteousness
will be their reward.

01:49:04.542 --> 01:49:09.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this truly is something
that can help the Bible student.

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when they start to face the changes

01:49:12.728 --> 01:49:16.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they need to make in life
if they have this love for Jehovah,

01:49:16.613 --> 01:49:19.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they won’t just view it
as something they have to do

01:49:19.787 --> 01:49:23.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to attain everlasting life.

01:49:23.003 --> 01:49:26.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they’ll view these things

01:49:26.261 --> 01:49:30.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as opportunities for them
to prove their love of Jehovah.

01:49:32.318 --> 01:49:35.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what has this symposium shown?

01:49:35.994 --> 01:49:39.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve listened to the various talks
and watched the videos,

01:49:39.878 --> 01:49:42.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s helped us to see
various ways that we can help

01:49:42.802 --> 01:49:45.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible students to make progress.

01:49:45.977 --> 01:49:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realize that conducting
a Bible study and helping

01:49:50.446 --> 01:49:52.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone to become a disciple

01:49:52.534 --> 01:49:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not just a matter of reading
certain paragraphs in a book

01:49:55.959 --> 01:50:01.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or using certain techniques;
a lot more is involved.

01:50:01.013 --> 01:50:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else?

01:50:03.018 --> 01:50:07.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember that the apostle Paul
was an experienced disciple-maker.

01:50:07.404 --> 01:50:11.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s turn our Bibles
to the first book of Thessalonians,

01:50:11.748 --> 01:50:14.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll notice here
that under inspiration,

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul tells us
what else is involved.

01:50:18.139 --> 01:50:21.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Thessalonians chapter 2

01:50:21.146 --> 01:50:24.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 7 and 8:

01:50:24.655 --> 01:50:29.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

01:50:29.542 --> 01:50:33.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Yes, we really need to care for these ones.

Well, becoming a disciple-maker
is a challenging work.

There’s a lot involved with it,
but don’t feel overwhelmed.

You can do it with Jehovah’s help

and the help of Jesus Christ.

01:51:18.328 --> 01:51:20.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember when Jesus gave us a commission

01:51:20.751 --> 01:51:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and make disciples,
what else did he say?

01:51:24.594 --> 01:51:27.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!
I am with you.”

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, with Jehovah’s help
and with the help of Jesus,

01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:33.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can experience a wonderful joy.

01:51:33.658 --> 01:51:35.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that joy?

01:51:35.704 --> 01:51:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy of seeing a new disciple
learn to love Jehovah.

01:51:42.178 --> 01:51:44.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers, for helping us

00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:04.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been distressed?

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you haven’t, you’re not human,

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because all humans
suffer from some form of distress

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:16.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the short period of life
that we have this side of the new world.

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is distress?

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some say it’s extreme anxiety.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others say it’s sorrow.

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:28.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there are a few who label it as pain.

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is it that causes the distress?

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:33.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a number of things.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:38.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one that somewhat heads the list:
death of a spouse.

00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:44.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second behind that
is injury or some type of illness.

00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there’s the loss of a job.

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:51.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How am I going to care
for my family, my wife, and my children?”

00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:54.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then here’s a very important one:

00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:58.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not being able to share

00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:02.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kingdom preaching work to the full.

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:06.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these are reasons
why we are distressed.

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:08.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course,
these are not the only reasons.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many others.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:14.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how would you fare?

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you feel

00:01:17.184 --> 00:01:20.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you were undergoing
some type of distress?

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, could you be sad?

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:25.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that how you’re going to feel?

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you depressed?

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some say: “Well, yes.
That’s what hits me.”

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:35.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others say: “Well, low in spirits
—I just, I don’t know;

00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:38.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m just down and out.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My get-up-and-go got up and left.”

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:47.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others say, “Well, I just feel
like going off and hiding and crying.”

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:50.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that pretty well sums it up.

00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:53.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it possible

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:58.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice when distressed?

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:01.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know it is
because we have examples in the Bible.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is filled with examples.

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just going to isolate one or two.

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was one who

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:13.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoiced behind being distressed.

00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:17.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to rejoice
despite the feelings that he had.

00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:19.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have your Bible handy,

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open it, please, to 2 Corinthians,

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:25.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read along with me

00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:29.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians 7:5.

00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:31.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice that it says:

00:02:31.887 --> 00:02:36.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, when we arrived in Macedonia,
our bodies got no relief,

00:02:36.392 --> 00:02:39.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we continued
to be afflicted in every way

00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:43.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—[now, note the following]
there were fights

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:47.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the outside, fears within”

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“fights on the outside, fears within.”

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:52.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Paul was up against it,

00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew it;
but yet he was able to rejoice.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:02:59.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was he up against?

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:03.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, earlier, Paul had hoped
to meet up with Titus in Troas.

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:06.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he hadn’t heard from Titus,
and he didn’t get a message from him.

00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:08.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wondered about him.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wondered how he was feeling.

00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:17.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was something hard-hitting
against him at this time

00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that Corinthian congregation?

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul wanted to know.

00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:26.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he worried about his friend,
and we would too

00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:30.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were waiting to hear from a friend
and we hadn’t received an answer.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likely worried so much

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:37.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it caused him to feel

00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:41.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somewhat depressed.

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:45.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He thought,
‘Well, how long will I have to wait

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:48.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on my friend Titus?’

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he didn’t have to wait too long.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Titus finally joined him in Macedonia.

00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:55.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened?

00:03:55.683 --> 00:03:59.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul was comforted,
and upon hearing Titus’ favorable report

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:03.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the brothers and sisters in Corinth,

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul “rejoiced even more,”

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says 2 Corinthians chapter 7,

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:12.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’ll just glance down
at verses 6 and 7.

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:16.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he was helped by his brother.

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:20.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the brotherhood that we
have to reach out to too.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:24.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it will help us
—this beautiful brotherhood

00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:28.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has brought us into.

00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:31.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll find
that our brothers are there for us

00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:35.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of what we
may be fighting against.

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:37.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can rejoice.

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may experience distress
in the form of discouragement.

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And usually all of us have had that

00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:47.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come into our life from time to time.

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many things that can
bring about discouragement.

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:54.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s something else:
anguish over a lost loved one

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:56.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe a marriage mate has died.

00:04:56.747 --> 00:04:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been together for many years,

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:02.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like Jehovah said in the garden of Eden:

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:04.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The two shall become one.”

00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:07.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, that’s really what happened
to you and your wife,

00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:11.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who you lost,
or your husband, who you lost.

00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:14.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you are somewhat low in spirits.

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are blue.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:20.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re a little downhearted, gloomy,

00:05:20.647 --> 00:05:24.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heavyhearted and, yes, sad.

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:27.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, let’s recall

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:32.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have three provisions
that can strengthen our ability to rejoice

00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:36.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the trials that we’re undergoing.

00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:37.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they?

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:42.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s the first one:
It’s our relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:42.753 --> 00:05:45.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David had a fine relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’ll turn to 1 Samuel chapter 30,

00:05:49.885 --> 00:05:53.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just follow along
as you hear me say a few things

00:05:53.097 --> 00:05:56.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind these two, three, or four verses.

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to start with verse 1.

00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:02.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 1 Samuel chapter 30.

00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:07.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When his own men wanted
to kill David because the Amalekites

00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:11.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
burned the city down and had taken
their wives

00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:15.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and children captive
—even took two of David’s wives—

00:06:15.746 --> 00:06:19.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was very distressed,
as you’ll see in that account.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, notice near the end of it,
there in verse 6:

00:06:23.212 --> 00:06:25.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But David strengthened himself

00:06:25.714 --> 00:06:28.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah his God.”

00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:30.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s where our strength comes from too.

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:34.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s from turning to Jehovah our God,

00:06:34.474 --> 00:06:38.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s there for us,
and he’s going to comfort us.

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:40.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the God of comfort,

00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:44.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as was acknowledged
in his written Word, the Bible.

00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:46.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first:
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:51.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here comes the second:
It’s our brotherhood.

00:06:52.284 --> 00:06:56.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, how we are strengthened
by our brothers!

00:06:56.288 --> 00:06:59.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the 133rd Psalm,

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:02.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says
at the very beginning: “Look!

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:05.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How good and how pleasant it is

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:08.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:12.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we all know
that that is a true statement,

00:07:12.472 --> 00:07:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also know something else:
It’s a major scheme

00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:21.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Satan the Devil
to isolate us from our brothers

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:25.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>if</i>  he can put us in jail.

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if that happens and we are jailed,
we can still associate.

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:33.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we do that if we’re jailed
and they’re way off somewhere

00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:35.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re behind bars?

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:39.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it is: by memories.

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:43.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, get out your scrapbook
and photo album

00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:46.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are locked in your brain

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:49.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(not the literal
but that are locked in your brain)

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:52.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feed on the “spiritual scraps.”

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they?
The memories.

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:59.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Memories are foods
that strengthen and cause rejoicing.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:04.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if any of you out there
are as old as I am,

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:08.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you know that old folks
do this all the time.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just too tired to do anything else,

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:14.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we just live on memories.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it brings joy to our heart.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s the second thing:
our brotherhood.

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the third is our hope.

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hope is to serve Jehovah
under righteous conditions

00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:25.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout eternity.

00:08:25.798 --> 00:08:29.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eternity is forever.

00:08:29.093 --> 00:08:31.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It never ends.

00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes on and on and on.

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:38.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, look at the sky above;

00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you cannot see
a beginning or an ending.

00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:45.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s eternity: always there.

00:08:45.444 --> 00:08:50.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to be able to rejoice
for an eternity living forever.

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:55.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,
take note of which provisions

00:08:55.454 --> 00:09:00.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped our brother and sister to rejoice
—and that, despite distress.

00:09:11.054 --> 00:09:14.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew when we first got married
that we would enjoy having a family.

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:17.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we first found out 

00:09:17.227 --> 00:09:19.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we were pregnant,
we were overjoyed.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Becky first told me she was pregnant,

00:09:22.983 --> 00:09:26.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like a light switch
went off in my heart.

00:09:26.278 --> 00:09:29.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, I felt like a dad.

00:09:30.032 --> 00:09:33.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instantly, you begin to make plans.

00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:36.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like all this love

00:09:36.163 --> 00:09:38.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just flooded in.

00:09:40.084 --> 00:09:43.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Becky was feeling a little off,

00:09:43.045 --> 00:09:45.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a friend encouraged us,
“Just go see the doctor.”

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:45.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we did.

00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:50.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while we were there,
they did an ultrasound.

00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:52.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctor came back

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said
there wasn’t a heartbeat anymore.

00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:01.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very difficult moment

00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:06.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something I can never forget.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because all of a sudden, all of those hopes,

00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:14.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those dreams,
those preparations you are making

00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they’re gone.

00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:25.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This place in your heart
that opened up to make room for this child

00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:31.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now this huge, gaping, open hole

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:34.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s nothing to fill it.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just is incredible emptiness.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know what to do.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was a meeting night,

00:10:47.404 --> 00:10:49.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we wanted to go to the meeting.

00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like the place
where Jehovah’s holy spirit is,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wanted to be there
because we knew

00:10:56.038 --> 00:11:00.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were not going to be able
to survive this on our own strength.

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:02.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed Jehovah.

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:06.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After people learned
that we had lost

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the baby, so many people

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:11.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared a little bit
of their experiences with me,

00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:15.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made us feel not alone,
for sure.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has also given us
some incredible friends

00:11:19.271 --> 00:11:21.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—friends who have stuck closer to us

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a brother,
friends who always seem to know

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:26.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re having a hard day,
who have prayed with us,

00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:30.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have taken walks with us, listened.

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know those are expressions
Jehovah has given us.

00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:40.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regaining joy
is a work in progress.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a particular scripture
in my personal study

00:11:44.172 --> 00:11:49.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I found very helpful,
Psalm 139, where it talks

00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:51.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how there’s nowhere

00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can’t find us.

00:11:54.724 --> 00:11:56.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no darkness
that is too dark for Jehovah.

00:11:56.977 --> 00:12:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt
like such a dark place.

00:12:00.063 --> 00:12:04.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dwelling on that scripture
was something that helped me a lot.

00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:05.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gradually, bit by bit,

00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:08.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like Jehovah did help me

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see beautiful things again.

00:12:15.663 --> 00:12:20.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we experience distress,
Jehovah helps us.

00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:23.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not left in despair.

00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:28.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, here
in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, it tells us,

00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:33.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we also include the footnote— 
Now, that’s the 8th verse

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:35.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:12:35.517 --> 00:12:37.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is how it reads:

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:41.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are hard-pressed in every way,
but not cramped beyond movement; 

00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:46.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are perplexed,
but not absolutely with no way out.”

00:12:46.153 --> 00:12:48.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the footnote says,

00:12:48.447 --> 00:12:52.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not left in despair.”

00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:55.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is not going
to leave us in despair.

00:12:55.913 --> 00:12:59.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, which provisions
from Jehovah are helping you to rejoice

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any mental or emotional distress

00:13:02.837 --> 00:13:06.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you may be experiencing even now?

00:13:06.466 --> 00:13:11.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your relationship with Jehovah,
the brotherhood,

00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:15.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hope, or is it something else?

00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:19.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to the provisions from Jehovah,

00:13:19.563 --> 00:13:23.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider these practical suggestions:

00:13:23.484 --> 00:13:27.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maintain a healthy diet.

00:13:27.238 --> 00:13:31.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coupled with that, get sufficient rest,

00:13:31.742 --> 00:13:35.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get a measure of exercise.

00:13:35.413 --> 00:13:38.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can make two lists.

00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:42.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, of the problems that you can solve,

00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:47.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other, of problems
you cannot solve at present.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Act on the first list,

00:13:49.553 --> 00:13:53.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leave the rest in Jehovah’s hands.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk things out with an elder

00:13:58.687 --> 00:14:02.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps a mature friend,
someone you’re close to,

00:14:02.858 --> 00:14:06.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a parent.

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:09.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are there to help us,

00:14:09.657 --> 00:14:12.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re ready and willing

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:15.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the knowledge
and the understanding that they have.

00:14:15.913 --> 00:14:19.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll do it generously with you.

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:22.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Realize that some forms of mental distress

00:14:22.754 --> 00:14:25.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may require professional assistance.

00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:30.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jesus said at Luke 5:31:

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who are healthy
do not need a physician,

00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:37.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those who are ill do.”

00:14:37.186 --> 00:14:39.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, that decision is up to you,

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s there in the scripture.

00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that you need
the help of a physician,

00:14:45.861 --> 00:14:49.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone who is qualified
to look into certain matters.

00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:54.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please rejoice in knowing
that you have Jehovah’s approval.

00:14:54.704 --> 00:14:58.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t doubt it, not even for a moment.

00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:01.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, granted, it’s not easy

00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:06.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with mental or emotional distress.

00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:08.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keep in mind

00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:11.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah understands,

00:15:11.763 --> 00:15:16.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will help you
to keep on enduring.

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your loyal endurance
brings Jehovah’s approval,

00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:26.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is one of the greatest reasons
that we have for rejoicing.

00:15:26.028 --> 00:15:29.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know that God has not left you.

00:15:29.407 --> 00:15:32.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have his approval,

00:15:32.994 --> 00:15:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a large shield surrounding you,
and his blessing.

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:42.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So rejoice in that knowledge,
and keep on rejoicing

00:15:42.253 --> 00:15:45.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite distress.

00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:50.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:54.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:59.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice
Despite . . . Persecution.”

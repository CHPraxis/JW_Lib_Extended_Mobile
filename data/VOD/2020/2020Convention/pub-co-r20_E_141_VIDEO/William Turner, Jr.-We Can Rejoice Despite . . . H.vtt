How do you feel when you miss a meal

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or haven’t eaten for some time?

00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:09.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, for many it affects their mood,

00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their ability to concentrate,

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes their ability
to even think straight.

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:20.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if that hunger
was beyond our control

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:25.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or prolonged to the point where we
had no other choice but to be hungry.

00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:29.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was the situation
that the apostle Paul found himself in

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:32.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he engaged in his ministry.

00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:35.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
at 2 Corinthians 11:27, Paul said

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:40.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was “in hunger and thirst,
[and] frequently without food.”

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This likely occurred while Paul was traveling

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:47.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through desolate regions or hot desert areas.

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:49.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, he may have been hungry and thirsty

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of being dependent on strangers

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on whatever provisions
he could obtain through his own labors

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in unfamiliar surroundings.

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:02.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul also lived
during the time of a great famine

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a famine which lasted
more than three years

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:09.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caused oppressive poverty
in Judea and Jerusalem.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite facing
all these times without food,

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s interesting to note
the attitude of the apostle Paul.

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:21.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 6:10,

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he describes himself
and his fellow Christians

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:27.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as sorrowing

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but ever rejoicing.”

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul acknowledged that difficult times

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:37.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could bring a measure of sorrow and distress.

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how was he able to rejoice

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:47.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have this inner joy—
despite his hunger?

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice his answer.

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:52.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me in your Bibles,
please, to the book of Philippians.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to read
Philippians chapter 4,

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:59.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 11-13.

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:06.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “Not that I am saying this
because I am in need,

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for I have learned to be self-sufficient
regardless of my circumstances.

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:15.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know how to be low on provisions
and how to have an abundance.

00:02:15.998 --> 00:02:19.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In everything and in all circumstances

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have learned the secret
of both how to be full and how to hunger,

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“both how to have an abundance
and how to do without.

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:31.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:34.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note that in verse 12,

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:41.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul speaks of learning “the secret

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both how to be full and how to hunger”?

00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This secret involves relying on Jehovah

00:02:49.492 --> 00:02:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for life’s necessities and being satisfied
with whatever he provides.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul certainly did that.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He learned a trade to support himself
so as not to be a burden to others.

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was fully occupied with his ministry,

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he had few material possessions.

00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was grateful for the brotherhood.

00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:15.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was appreciative of what those brothers
were able to provide—what he needed.

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul learned
through each of these experiences.

00:03:19.857 --> 00:03:23.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as he saw Jehovah’s hand in his life,

00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:27.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became apparent to him
that no matter what the circumstances were,

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:32.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had to look to Jehovah
to satisfy his needs.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice verse 13?

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sustained Paul.

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:39.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave him power.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Paul did face
those adverse circumstances,

00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:45.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still able to be content,

00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:50.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain inner joy,
and carry out his ministry.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can you and I
learn from Paul’s example?

00:03:56.313 --> 00:04:01.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that we too might face
hunger for a variety of reasons.

00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:04.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, food shortages

00:04:04.822 --> 00:04:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this could result from civil unrest
or an economic crisis.

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:13.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
World events today
have caused many to lose their jobs

00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world,
including our brothers.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:19.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a personal economic setback

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may force us to live on less.

00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:25.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hunger can also result from persecution.

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:29.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When many of our brothers
were put in Nazi concentration camps,

00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depriving them of adequate food
was one of the diabolical methods used

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an effort to break their integrity.

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:41.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even when it comes
to theocratic pursuits,

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:46.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some who move to serve where the need
is greater are forced to make adjustments

00:04:46.408 --> 00:04:50.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and must learn to be content with less.

00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:53.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, really, in any number of situations,

00:04:53.582 --> 00:04:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and I could experience a lack of food

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even hunger,

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:04.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that could make us
feel anxious and distressed.

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:09.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the antidote is trust

00:05:09.057 --> 00:05:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reliance on Jehovah.

00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:16.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when we do that,
it helps us to remain calm

00:05:16.314 --> 00:05:20.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to take things one day at a time.

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:25.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When inflation hit in his country,
one father said,

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:29.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My daily prayer was simply
that God would ‘give us today

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our bread for this day’

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order for us to survive.”

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must also be grateful
for whatever Jehovah provides.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that same father went to the food line
to purchase items,

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said that one time
the only thing they had left

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:51.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was something he didn’t like.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did he do?

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I didn’t like it,

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:59.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it was food.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what we ate that night.”

00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:06.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was grateful
to Jehovah for providing it.

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, perhaps right now,
we may be in a position

00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:13.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we only eat what we like.

00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:16.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if circumstances change,

00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could we adjust and still be grateful?

00:06:20.883 --> 00:06:25.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it reassuring that we
are cared for by a God

00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:28.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gives us what we need?

00:06:29.517 --> 00:06:34.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, it is important that we
utilize the resources Jehovah provides.

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:38.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like you to watch the following video.

00:06:38.276 --> 00:06:40.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you do, note which provisions

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:45.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped our sister to rejoice
despite experiencing hunger.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here in Venezuela,
long before the crisis,

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:08.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there weren’t so many financial problems
like we have today.

00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:14.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could go to the stores, we could buy

00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:16.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the amount of food we wanted,

00:07:16.483 --> 00:07:18.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and life was peaceful.

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:28.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us,
the situation started to get really bad

00:07:28.162 --> 00:07:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five years ago.

00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:34.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to get any food at all,

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:35.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even basic items.

00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:39.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it came time to buy something,
well, it was all gone.

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were two elders that,

00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:45.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say,
were checking on me almost daily

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:48.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—always asking
how much food I needed.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I prepared it and served it,
my main concern

00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:55.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that my children would get enough.

00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:02.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always gave them more food.

00:08:03.992 --> 00:08:05.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though
my youngest boy would ask,

00:08:05.994 --> 00:08:09.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mommy, is that
what you’re going to eat?”

00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:13.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would tell him,
“Yes, dear, I’m fine with this.”

00:08:13.753 --> 00:08:16.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he would say,
“I don’t think so.”

00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:22.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would think, ‘I can handle this,’

00:08:22.637 --> 00:08:27.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the amount that I was eating
just wasn’t enough for my body.

00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:37.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Sunday morning, during the meeting,
I wasn’t feeling very well but,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to Jehovah,
my daughter was nearby.

00:08:40.489 --> 00:08:42.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came to, she said,

00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, you fainted three times!”

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “That can’t be!”

00:08:47.664 --> 00:08:51.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brothers
immediately took me to the doctor.

00:08:51.292 --> 00:08:54.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was diagnosed
as having severe malnutrition.

00:08:57.632 --> 00:08:59.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers began a plan of action:

00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought food
that was already prepared

00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:05.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in fact, they would sit
by me until I finished my food.

00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:08.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have not yet

00:09:08.894 --> 00:09:12.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fully recovered my body weight,
because I was a little heavier.

00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:14.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But healthwise,
I have felt very well.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:21.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders were always looking after me,

00:09:21.032 --> 00:09:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that boosted my energy.

00:09:23.493 --> 00:09:25.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And definitely,
I never lost my joy.

00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:32.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s all thanks to Jehovah!

00:09:32.503 --> 00:09:35.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to him because he
is the One who sustains me.

00:09:35.714 --> 00:09:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He clothes me, he feeds me,
and he gives me great friends.

00:09:39.135 --> 00:09:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what Jehovah gives me.

00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the provisions
that helped our sister?

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, her relationship with Jehovah

00:09:54.359 --> 00:09:57.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she saw the importance
of staying close to him

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and regularly attending her meetings

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:03.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then, of course, the brotherhood.

00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:07.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t it comforting to see
how attentive the elders were,

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:11.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making daily checks on her,
providing food for her and her family,

00:10:11.586 --> 00:10:14.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even making sure
she ate enough as well?

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:18.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s these same provisions

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:22.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,
receiving relief from the brotherhood,

00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:27.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as holding fast to our hope
—that can help us to rejoice

00:10:27.353 --> 00:10:30.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any periods of hunger.

00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:32.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We agree.

00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced
of what Paul said at Philippians 4:12.

00:10:36.487 --> 00:10:41.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can and does
provide life’s necessities

00:10:41.326 --> 00:10:45.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all circumstances.

00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:49.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When facing hunger,
it is natural to be concerned

00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:52.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our own welfare
and that of our loved ones.

00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:55.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, as we’ve seen,

00:10:55.174 --> 00:10:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is possible to rejoice

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any hunger we may experience.

00:11:00.846 --> 00:11:02.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the key?

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:05.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn the secret.

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:07.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone likes to be in on a secret,

00:11:07.687 --> 00:11:12.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah is more than happy
to reveal this one to us,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we must rely on him

00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:19.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how he acts in our behalf.

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:22.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How pleased Jehovah must be
when his servants remain

00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:25.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal and joyful, trusting

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will never abandon them!

00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:34.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of the symposium,

00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:41.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice
Despite . . . Nakedness.”

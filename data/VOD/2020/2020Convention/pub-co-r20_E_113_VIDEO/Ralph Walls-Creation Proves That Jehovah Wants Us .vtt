Rice and beans

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:07.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you can eat them with just about anything,

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will be delicious.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about kimchi?

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:13.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a dish of fermented vegetables

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a variety of seasonings,

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
producing a complex taste of sour and spicy.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And jollof rice?

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:24.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So flavorsome!

00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:29.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is cooked in an appetizing tomato
and pepper puree

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:32.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
laced with chili for a zesty taste.

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of a day of hard work,

00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:41.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how about a piece of sweet,
fruity, cool watermelon?

00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:44.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderfully refreshing.

00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All over planet Earth,

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are a vast variety of nutritious,

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delicious, and refreshing foods.

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what God has provided.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is just as the Bible says.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read along with me

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:03.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ecclesiastes chapter 3,

00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:06.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 12 and 13:

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:10.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have concluded
that there is nothing better

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:15.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for them than to rejoice
and to do good during their life,

00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:19.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“also that everyone should eat and drink

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:27.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:30.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, you enjoy your favorite foods.

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:34.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mouth may be watering
just from thinking about it.

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:38.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As much as we enjoy eating individually,

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:41.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we share a good meal
with family and friends,

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:44.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a special time.

00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:46.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:48.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Jehovah’s provision of food

00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:52.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives evidence
that he wants us to enjoy life.

00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are sweet, . . .

00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:09.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
salty, . . .

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sour, . . .

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:17.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bitter, . . .

00:02:17.793 --> 00:02:21.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a rich, savory taste called umami.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we enjoy not just five flavors

00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but possibly over 100,000.

00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:38.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chewing releases aromas

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:47.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that pass up into our nose
through the back of our throat.

00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:51.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taste and smell then combine
to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our taste buds develop before we’re born.

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:09.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid,

00:03:09.348 --> 00:03:11.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may taste what its mother eats

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:18.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is more likely
to enjoy the same foods she does.

00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:23.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just eat to survive.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to eat!

00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us happy.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:36.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says why:

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That everyone should eat and drink

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:45.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:58.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are made so that we must take in

00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:01.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physical food regularly in order to survive.

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:05.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, how grateful we are that our Creator

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made eating so enjoyable.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That reflects the way of Jehovah;

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:16.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling our needs creates joy not dread.

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:18.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would not find a normal individual

00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
complaining about eating a good dinner.

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:25.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, rather, it’s enjoyable.

00:04:25.513 --> 00:04:30.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now turn with me, please,
to Matthew chapter 4,

00:04:30.018 --> 00:04:33.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice another vital need we have

00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:35.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that relates to food

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:38.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 4:4.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:45.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “It is written: ‘Man must live,

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘not on bread alone,

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:51.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on every word
that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.’”

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:56.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need physical food
to stay alive, and we enjoy doing so.

00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:00.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the same is true with spiritual food;

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:04.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need it to stay alive spiritually.

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:08.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, just as is true with physical food,

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:13.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we partake of spiritual food,
we find true joy.

00:05:13.148 --> 00:05:15.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that what Jesus said

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:18.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his introduction
to the Sermon on the Mount?

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are those conscious
of their spiritual need.”

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:26.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beauty of Jehovah’s way

00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:31.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that he has made the satisfying
of our spiritual need enjoyable.

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:34.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:37.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because God’s Word, the Bible,

00:05:37.632 --> 00:05:41.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is written in a way that is appealing to us.

00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:45.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his great wisdom,
he used humans to write the Bible.

00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:47.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:49.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If, for example, he had used angels,

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:51.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would they have been able to convey

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:55.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the emotions and feelings
with a human touch?

00:05:55.485 --> 00:06:00.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Words convey
not just information but emotions,

00:06:00.073 --> 00:06:05.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as fear, sorrow, and disappointment.

00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:08.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By allowing imperfect men
to choose the wording

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the ideas they received
through holy spirit,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God conveyed his message with warmth,

00:06:15.423 --> 00:06:20.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
variety, and the appeal
of human emotions and feelings.

00:06:20.428 --> 00:06:24.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes his Word appealing to us humans.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:28.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to that, Jehovah provides

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a variety of spiritual food in abundance.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:37.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking in spiritual food requires effort,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as it takes in preparing
and eating a delicious meal

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:47.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—rice and beans, kimchi, and jollof rice.

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each take time and effort to prepare.

00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:54.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes effort to plant,
cultivate, and pick watermelons.

00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a joy it is to experience
the results of such efforts!

00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to make

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the study of God’s Word more enjoyable?

00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:07.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When reading the Bible,

00:07:07.312 --> 00:07:11.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do so aloud in a lively manner.

00:07:11.858 --> 00:07:13.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do that,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we experience what Psalm 1:2 says:

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:23.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His delight is in the law of Jehovah,

00:07:23.287 --> 00:07:27.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he reads His law
in an undertone day and night.”

00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:33.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to do research and to meditate.

00:07:33.006 --> 00:07:35.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By being creative,
you can make personal study

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:39.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and family study meaningful and satisfying.

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When reading the Bible, imagine the sounds,

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:48.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sights, the smells,
and the appearance of the events.

00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:54.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The August 15, 2011, <i>Watchtower</i> said:

00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:57.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is not the intention
of the Governing Body

00:07:57.908 --> 00:08:01.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to establish one format for all families.

00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:04.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since circumstances vary,

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:08.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is appropriate
for each family head or individual

00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:10.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to evaluate how this weekly occasion

00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be used in the best way.”

00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,

00:08:15.218 --> 00:08:19.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make family and personal worship
an enjoyable time.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not always be
necessary or even desirable

00:08:23.018 --> 00:08:26.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use a question-and-answer method.

00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:28.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A relaxed atmosphere is more conducive

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:32.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a lively and stimulating discussion.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:35.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It promotes creative thinking.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We marvel at Jehovah’s love and wisdom.

00:08:39.369 --> 00:08:44.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only has he given us life
and the means to sustain it

00:08:44.332 --> 00:08:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he has also given us the ability

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:50.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find pleasure in doing so.

00:08:50.047 --> 00:08:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of human rulership,

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:57.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many today do not receive
adequate amounts of physical food.

00:08:57.472 --> 00:09:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the day is near when our loving Creator

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:03.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will see to it that everyone alive will have

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:07.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an abundance of food and drink.

00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:12.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
may all of us discern Jehovah’s love for us

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the food and drink that we do have

00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the abundance of spiritual food.

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:21.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

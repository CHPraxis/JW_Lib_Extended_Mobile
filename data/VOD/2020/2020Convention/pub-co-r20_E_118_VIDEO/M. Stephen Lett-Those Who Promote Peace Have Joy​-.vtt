Ravens brought Elijah bread
and meat morning and evening.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus transformed
a hundred gallons of water

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:12.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into very fine wine.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A hundred and twenty Christians

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suddenly could speak
different languages.

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:22.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did those three events
have in common?

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were all three miracles
produced by holy spirit.

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:29.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But miracles
are no longer happening today.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that right?

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:33.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not really, if you think about it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we think about it,
the peace, the love,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the harmony of Jehovah’s people
in a world that is so divided

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a modern-day miracle.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast,
Satan’s world around us

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:49.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is becoming more divided by race,

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:53.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ethnicity, religion,
political affiliation, and so forth.

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:56.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah’s people
are more united than ever.

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:00.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we attend
our assemblies and conventions,

00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:02.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we especially see this.

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see different races
and nationalities enjoying

00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:11.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a genuinely peaceful,
joyful gathering.

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:14.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, looking at a world map,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Lett and I were able to calculate
that during the past 20 years,

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:22.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve attended assemblies,
conventions, large gatherings

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in at least 82 different countries;

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:27.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every one of them

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:31.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overflowed with love and joy;

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:35.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every one of them
convinced us even more

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these are Jehovah’s people

00:01:38.622 --> 00:01:42.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people he’s gathered from all nations,
tribes, peoples, and tongues

00:01:42.626 --> 00:01:47.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into his organization
and is preparing for the new world.

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:52.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,
What makes this modern-day miracle possible?

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is,
it stems from a peaceful relationship

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:59.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have with our Father, Jehovah,

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:02.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was called
at 1 Thessalonians 5:23,

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the God of peace.”

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As his children,
we strive to imitate him.

00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:11.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all brothers and sisters
—we have the same father—

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:16.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we are ones who show peace
and love like our Father.

00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:18.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s another question:

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is maintaining this peace
and harmony automatic?

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:27.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is maintaining a garden,
an automobile, our health automatic?

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it takes effort,
doesn’t it?

00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:32.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all imperfect, so we have to work

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at maintaining peace every day.

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the thought if you go
to 1 Peter chapter 3, please.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does take effort.

00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:45.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:10:

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For ‘whoever would love life
and see good days

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:52.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘must guard his tongue from bad

00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:55.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and his lips from speaking deception.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:03:00.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let him turn away
from what is bad and do what is good;

00:03:00.207 --> 00:03:03.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[now notice] let him seek

00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:06.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace and pursue it.’”

00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:10.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, effort is needed
to turn from bad and do good.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seek peace and pursue it”
—two action verbs.

00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:17.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to illustrate that,
think of a policeman

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:20.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeking, pursuing, a criminal.

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:22.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The criminal is trying
to get away, isn’t he?

00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:25.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, peace tries to get away
from us because of imperfection,

00:03:25.983 --> 00:03:28.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to pursue it.

00:03:28.152 --> 00:03:31.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, the Bible links

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace to happiness.

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:38.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 12:20,
the theme scripture for this talk, says:

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who promote peace have joy.”

00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:48.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:9:
“Happy are the peacemakers,

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:50.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since they will be called sons of God.”

00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:53.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it didn’t say,
“Happy are the peaceful.”

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just tranquil, passive

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even a dead body is peaceful.

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:02.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, “happy are the peacemakers.”

00:04:02.438 --> 00:04:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A peacemaker
actively promotes peace.

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:08.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes peace
where it previously was lacking.

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:12.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about cows,
they make milk;

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bees make honey;
a cheesemaker makes cheese;

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:18.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a peacemaker makes peace.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s been lost;
it’s been disturbed;

00:04:21.374 --> 00:04:25.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he has skill in restoring it and,
of course, a peacemaker

00:04:25.837 --> 00:04:30.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoids doing anything that would disturb
the peace in the first place.

00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:34.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He works very hard
to create an environment

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where peace can prevail.

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now that leads us into the discussion
about how peacemakers

00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoid the two peace destroyers:

00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:49.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jealousy and contentiousness.

00:04:49.778 --> 00:04:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these two peace disturbers
are identified

00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in James chapter 3.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:57.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go there, please.

00:04:57.828 --> 00:04:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In James chapter 3,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together
verses 14 and 15:

00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But if you have bitter jealousy

00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:11.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and contentiousness in your hearts,

00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:15.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not be bragging
and lying against the truth.

00:05:15.054 --> 00:05:19.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not the wisdom
that comes down from above;

00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:23.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is earthly,
animalistic, demonic.”

00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:27.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice first
that jealousy is identified.

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:29.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is jealousy?

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means to resent someone
because of his possessions,

00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:35.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talents, or position.

00:05:35.617 --> 00:05:40.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than be happy for him,
we resent him,

00:05:40.164 --> 00:05:45.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even dislike him for what he has
—usually things that we don’t have.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:50.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what makes this very serious
is that jealousy can escalate

00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:52.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being envy.

00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:57.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is envy, and what’s the difference
between envy and jealousy?

00:05:57.307 --> 00:06:00.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Biblical reference work says this:

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jealousy’ . . . refers to the desire

00:06:03.938 --> 00:06:06.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be as well off as another,

00:06:06.608 --> 00:06:10.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . [but] ‘envy’ refers

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:14.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the desire to deprive
another of what he has.”

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:18.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the envious person
not only begrudges what someone has

00:06:18.954 --> 00:06:21.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he actually wants
to take it away from him.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That second peace destroyer
is contentiousness.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being disagreeable, argumentative,
competitive—a terrible quality.

00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:35.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the product of pride
and selfish ambition.

00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:38.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read earlier
at James 3:14, 15,

00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:42.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s certainly not part of that “wisdom
that comes down from above,”

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, it is “earthly,”

00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:49.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
characteristic of earthly humans
who are alienated from God.

00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is animalistic,

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:55.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
characteristic of animals
who lack spirituality

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are often contentious
with each other.

00:06:58.453 --> 00:07:00.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is even demonic,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
characteristic of the wicked spirits

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are very proud and ambitious.

00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But genuine peacemakers
work very hard

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid
these two peace disturbers:

00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:16.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jealousy and contentiousness.

00:07:16.597 --> 00:07:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They neither flaunt their talents
nor do they feel threatened

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if others
are more skilled preachers, teachers,

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
organizers, or shepherds.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re very happy
to be considered “a lesser one,”

00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus encouraged
at Luke 9:48.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s true that a peacemaker
may desire certain privileges of service,

00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:42.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he is not consumed with ambition.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s balanced in his approach,

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:47.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it says at 1 Timothy 3:1:

00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:52.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a man is reaching out
to be an overseer,

00:07:52.134 --> 00:07:54.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is desirous of a fine work.”

00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:58.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it didn’t say that he
should ambitiously “grab”

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:01.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be an overseer; he’s balanced.

00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate this

00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:07.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reaching out for a nice,
tasty piece of fruit on a tree.

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:10.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then think of a small boy

00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:13.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very aggressively grabbing for a toy,

00:08:13.531 --> 00:08:16.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps to try to take it
away from another boy.

00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a real difference,
isn’t there?

00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:22.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, how does
a peacemaker reach out

00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:25.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to qualify
for privileges of service?

00:08:25.043 --> 00:08:27.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he just works hard

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:30.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop Christian qualities
within himself,

00:08:30.256 --> 00:08:33.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he just works hard
in behalf of Kingdom interests.

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:37.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s guided by Galatians 6:4,

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:40.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:
“He will have cause for rejoicing

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in regard to himself alone,

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not in comparison
with the other person.”

00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:52.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, a real peacemaker
humbly waits on Jehovah

00:08:52.112 --> 00:08:57.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to determine when he’s qualified
to receive a certain privilege.

00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:59.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows, doesn’t he?

00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:01.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the account about Moses,

00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how when he was 40 years old,

00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he really thought
he was qualified

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:10.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ready to lead
the Israelites out of Egypt—

00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:13.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah knew
he wasn’t ready yet.

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:16.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, after tending flocks

00:09:16.554 --> 00:09:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 40 years in Midian,
when he was now 80 years old,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knew
that now he was ready.

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:27.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, at this point,
Moses thought he wasn’t ready,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:30.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah
assured him that he was.

00:09:30.777 --> 00:09:34.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when a peacemaker
does receive a privilege of service,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he credits receiving it to Jehovah

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not as a personal achievement.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to conclude this portion
of our talk about avoiding

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these peace disturbers, we say,

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:53.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May we all strive
to be genuine peacemakers,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:57.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“analyzing ourselves and praying
for Jehovah’s spirit

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to help us to avoid
any tendency to be jealous,

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:06.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to envy, or to be contentious
with our brothers.”

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:10.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s talk about some things
we can do personally

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:13.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to promote peace and joy.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s talk quickly
about six things we can do.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:21.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
Cultivate humility and modesty.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humility means to consider others
superior to ourselves.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty means to be aware
of our own limitations.

00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:34.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we have
those two closely related qualities,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to apply Romans 12:3,

00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:41.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that we
should not ‘think more of ourselves

00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:44.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘than it is necessary to think,

00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:48.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to think
so as to have a sound mind.’

00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:52.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s the second thing
we can do to promote joy and peace:

00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:54.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appreciate and value

00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:59.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good qualities
and talents of others.

00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:02.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on their good points,
not their flaws.

00:11:02.914 --> 00:11:06.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how thankful we can be
that Jehovah does that with us.

00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:08.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, we’d be doomed,
wouldn’t we?

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:12.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe you heard
the illustration of a brother

00:11:12.382 --> 00:11:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holding up a white piece of paper

00:11:15.344 --> 00:11:18.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a red spot in the middle

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asking an audience
what they see.

00:11:21.684 --> 00:11:24.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, most say
that they see a red spot.

00:11:24.562 --> 00:11:27.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he points out
that actually 99 percent

00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they’re looking at
is white paper.

00:11:30.693 --> 00:11:33.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we tend to notice the spot.

00:11:33.488 --> 00:11:36.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we’re not careful,
that’s what we can do with our brothers

00:11:36.032 --> 00:11:39.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—notice that flaw
rather than all the good qualities.

00:11:39.035 --> 00:11:41.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But may all of us cultivate

00:11:41.913 --> 00:11:44.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jehovahlike quality

00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:49.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of noticing,
appreciating, and valuing

00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good qualities of our brothers.

00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a third thing we can do:

00:11:55.177 --> 00:11:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never presume that fellow Christians

00:11:58.263 --> 00:12:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are trying to outdo us.

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 13:7 says
that love “believes”

00:12:04.436 --> 00:12:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love “hopes all things.”

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we believe (we hope)

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:12.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers are doing
what they’re doing out of a good motive

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to please Jehovah,
not to outdo us.

00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we remember, Jehovah
has appointed only one Judge, Jesus.

00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:21.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are no judge.

00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have no right
to negatively judge our brothers’ motives.

00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a fourth thing we can do:
Strive to always rejoice

00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:36.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over our brothers’ privileges
and successes.

00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:40.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:15:
“Rejoice with those who rejoice;

00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weep with those who weep.”

00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:45.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, which is easier?

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, generally, it’s not so hard

00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:50.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to weep with someone
who’s had some tragedy.

00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:52.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what if some really good things

00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:55.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happen to them
and it hasn’t happened to us? 

00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:57.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m so happy.

00:12:57.199 --> 00:13:00.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just got appointed
as a regular pioneer.’

00:13:00.035 --> 00:13:03.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we were really hoping
to get into the pioneer work ourself,

00:13:03.497 --> 00:13:05.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we haven’t been able to do it.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we going to really be happy
from our heart with our brother?

00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:13.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we love our brother
and we love Jehovah,

00:13:13.674 --> 00:13:18.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re going to work really hard
to have that right attitude from our heart.

00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:22.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will smash
any hint of jealousy;

00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:25.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll smash it with love.

00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:28.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a fifth thing we can do:

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithfully support those

00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve in responsible positions,
such as the elders.

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:38.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And obviously doing that,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
supporting these ones
that are taking the lead,

00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:45.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
definitely promotes peace
and joy in the congregation.

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:50.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one more thing:
Center your life on serving Jehovah

00:13:50.212 --> 00:13:52.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping others

00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than focusing on ourselves,

00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:58.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe our feelings,

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:01.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our perceived reputation.

00:14:01.098 --> 00:14:04.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we focus on serving Jehovah

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping our brothers,
we’ll truly be

00:14:07.063 --> 00:14:10.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace promoters
in the congregation.

00:14:10.358 --> 00:14:14.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing those six things, we’ll prove

00:14:14.112 --> 00:14:16.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re peacemakers
(peace promoters)

00:14:16.281 --> 00:14:19.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are reflecting
the wisdom from above.

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s the thought again.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to James chapter 3

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:25.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that wisdom from above.

00:14:25.374 --> 00:14:28.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s what
we want to reflect on.

00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:30.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In James chapter 3,

00:14:30.295 --> 00:14:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s take a look
this time at verse 13:

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who is wise
and understanding among you?

00:14:38.095 --> 00:14:41.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let him by his fine conduct

00:14:41.015 --> 00:14:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“demonstrate works
performed with a mildness

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from wisdom.”

00:14:47.146 --> 00:14:49.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then drop down to verse 17:

00:14:49.524 --> 00:14:54.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the wisdom
from above is first of all pure,

00:14:54.112 --> 00:14:57.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then [now notice] peaceable

00:14:57.448 --> 00:15:02.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[It didn’t say peaceful, passive
but peaceable—that means a peacemaker.],

00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:05.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“reasonable, ready to obey,

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“full of mercy and good fruits,
impartial, not hypocritical.

00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:14.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, the fruit
of righteousness is sown

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:16.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in peaceful conditions

00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:20.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who are making peace.”

00:15:20.472 --> 00:15:24.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’re encouraged
to be a peacemaker.

00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:28.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this,
we bring joy to ourselves

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we impart joy to others and,

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:35.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most importantly,
we make Jehovah rejoice.

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:39.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, think about this:
Once a peacemaker

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t mean
always a peacemaker.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to keep working
at this quality.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this will be well-illustrated

00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:52.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the following video interview.

00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got married in 2002.

00:15:57.385 --> 00:15:58.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around that time,

00:15:58.637 --> 00:16:00.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was appointed a ministerial servant,

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:03.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife and I
were serving as regular pioneers.

00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:06.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2004,

00:16:06.812 --> 00:16:09.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were given the opportunity
to serve as special pioneers.

00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:14.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was something that we really wanted

00:16:14.236 --> 00:16:16.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we wanted to do more for Jehovah.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we got that assignment,

00:16:17.782 --> 00:16:19.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were delighted.

00:16:20.659 --> 00:16:23.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in the congregation
were also very happy for us.

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:30.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But everything did not go smoothly.

00:16:30.586 --> 00:16:33.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time went on,
I faced some difficult situations.

00:16:35.258 --> 00:16:39.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I was not appointed
as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:43.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation,

00:16:43.433 --> 00:16:46.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two brothers who had served
as ministerial servants

00:16:46.561 --> 00:16:49.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a shorter time than I had
were appointed as elders.

00:16:51.775 --> 00:16:56.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that those brothers 
did not have as much experience as I had.

00:16:56.029 --> 00:16:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘I am the one with the experience,

00:16:58.574 --> 00:17:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so why didn’t I get appointed?’

00:17:00.743 --> 00:17:02.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to question my own qualifications,

00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:04.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this made me very sad.

00:17:06.457 --> 00:17:08.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the two brothers were appointed,

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to dislike them.

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:13.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also angry with them,

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:15.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the anger even progressed

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little toward hatred.

00:17:19.846 --> 00:17:23.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real challenge for me
to serve in that congregation.

00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:25.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attending meetings was difficult;

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would go with a heavy heart.

00:17:29.189 --> 00:17:32.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I put a lot of effort
into making personal changes

00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:35.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—changing my attitude
and getting rid of my negative traits.

00:17:35.862 --> 00:17:38.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that if I did nothing,

00:17:38.532 --> 00:17:41.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was going to affect the worship
I gave to Jehovah

00:17:41.076 --> 00:17:44.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the relationship with my brothers.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:49.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
could end up completely losing our joy.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:53.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to make things right,
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:17:53.964 --> 00:17:56.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent time in deep, personal Bible study.

00:17:56.717 --> 00:17:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife would also find articles

00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:00.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about maintaining peace with the brothers

00:18:00.805 --> 00:18:03.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would give them to me to read.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:06.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She even selected Kingdom songs
that dealt with maintaining peace,

00:18:06.269 --> 00:18:08.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she would sing them to me.

00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:14.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a lot of changes to my attitude
and worked hard to progress

00:18:14.778 --> 00:18:17.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a person whom Jehovah would approve.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to view my brothers

00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:22.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same way Jehovah did
and to serve him with joy.

00:18:25.914 --> 00:18:29.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wanted to give
my best to Jehovah and to the brothers.

00:18:30.586 --> 00:18:32.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time, I did not want

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those wrong thoughts
to ever come back into my heart.

00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:42.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The valuable lesson that I have learned

00:18:42.097 --> 00:18:44.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that privileges are not most important.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it is serving Jehovah
that brings genuine happiness.

00:18:48.145 --> 00:18:51.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I am finding
real joy and satisfaction

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my service to Jehovah.

00:18:55.319 --> 00:19:00.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may each of us
prayerfully work to have the attitude

00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:03.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of wanting
to be a peacemaker.

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do this,
we prove to Jehovah

00:19:07.207 --> 00:19:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re the kind of person
that he wants in his new world.

00:19:11.795 --> 00:19:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 37:11,
it says of the new world:

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:20.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The meek will possess the earth,
and they will find [their] exquisite delight

00:19:20.512 --> 00:19:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the abundance of peace.”

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:26.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the new world
will be a very peaceful place.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re a peace promoter now,
we will convince Jehovah

00:19:31.148 --> 00:19:35.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will be an asset
toward that peace of his new world.

00:19:35.653 --> 00:19:40.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:
In the new world, it will be natural

00:19:40.157 --> 00:19:44.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for perfect people to just display peace

00:19:44.245 --> 00:19:46.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this beautiful aspect

00:19:46.414 --> 00:19:49.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fruitage of Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right now,
we have to work at it, don’t we?

00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:54.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to seek peace; pursue it.

00:19:54.047 --> 00:19:57.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re a peace pursuer now,

00:19:57.133 --> 00:19:59.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will convince Jehovah

00:19:59.844 --> 00:20:03.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will be a peace displayer

00:20:03.014 --> 00:20:07.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his righteous new world,
and he’ll want us to be there.

00:20:07.227 --> 00:20:10.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s diligently promote peace

00:20:10.606 --> 00:20:15.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute toward the strength
and the happiness

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:20.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s beautiful organization
(which really is a modern-day miracle),

00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:25.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remembering that those
who promote peace have joy

00:20:25.287 --> 00:20:27.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and impart joy to others.

00:20:27.999 --> 00:20:31.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they make
Jehovah’s heart rejoice,

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all that rejoicing
will last forever.

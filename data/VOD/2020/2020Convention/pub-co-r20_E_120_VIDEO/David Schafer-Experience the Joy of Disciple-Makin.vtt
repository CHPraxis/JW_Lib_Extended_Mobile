How do you feel
about doing things that you do well?

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:10.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever noticed that people
who are experts at what they do

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:13.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seem to enjoy the job, whatever it is,

00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:16.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they delight in training others?

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is because the more people there are
who understand how to support a project,

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:23.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make music, or play a game,

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:26.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more enjoyable it is
when we combine forces as a group,

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:29.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a team, an orchestra.

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a direct correlation
between skill and joy.

00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:39.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you feel
about the work of making disciples?

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Luke chapter 10.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:46.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus loved making disciples.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 40:8 says
prophetically concerning Jesus:

00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:54.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To do your will,
O my God, is my delight.”

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:59.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice here
that Luke 10:21 tells us

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when Jesus was contemplating the results
of a particular preaching campaign,

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he became overjoyed

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[overjoyed] in the holy spirit.”

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was a masterful teacher,
but as this chapter of the Bible shows,

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:19.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped his disciples
to become skillful as well.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thus, as pointed out
at Luke 10:17,

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:26.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they also found joy in this work.

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:29.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our joy grows

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we work to improve our skills.

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:36.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this symposium
will discuss six essential skills

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:41.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to become
not just more effective preachers

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:44.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but effective disciple-makers.

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:46.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What skills are required?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see them listed on your program:
asking questions,

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:55.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unleashing the power of God’s Word,
illustrating key points,

00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:58.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaching with enthusiasm,
showing empathy,

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reaching the heart.

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium includes
a series of dramatizations

00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:08.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that follow the progress
of one Bible student.

00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After each video, we’ll discuss

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the skill that was featured
and how we can use it.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:16.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will help us to experience more joy

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our disciple-making work.

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready?

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:24.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss our first skill:
asking questions.

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:27.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we ask questions?

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions serve a number of purposes.

00:02:30.013 --> 00:02:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we pose them just to stimulate
interest and to get the conversation rolling.

00:02:35.018 --> 00:02:38.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times, we’re interested
in hearing how a person thinks

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:42.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can know better
how to direct the conversation.

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Matthew chapter 22.

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew what was in man.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:52.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could read hearts,
so he didn’t need people

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tell him where they
stood on certain issues.

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:59.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, he used questions
to encourage his listeners

00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:02.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reason things out for themselves.

00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:05.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how he did that here

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:10.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 22:41-45:

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now while the Pharisees
were gathered together, Jesus asked them:

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What do you think about the Christ?

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whose son is he?’

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They said to him: ‘David’s.’

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He asked them: ‘How is it, then,

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:30.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that David under inspiration
calls him Lord,

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘saying,
“Jehovah said to my Lord:

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:38.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Sit at my right hand until I put
your enemies beneath your feet”?

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:41.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If, then, David calls him Lord,

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how is he his son?’”

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Four questions.

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:49.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wouldn’t it have been easier

00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:53.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and quicker just to tell
people the answers?

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, but those questions

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led honesthearted ones to draw
accurate conclusions for themselves

00:04:00.442 --> 00:04:05.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time revealing
the true motives of opposers.

00:04:05.197 --> 00:04:08.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions are powerful.

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:10.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we use them,

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should keep in mind
the words of James 1:19.

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what this says
—James 1:19:

00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:22.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Know this, my beloved brothers:

00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone must be quick to listen,

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
slow to speak, slow to anger.”

00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:34.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To ask a question
without waiting for the answer

00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:36.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be like making an appointment
to meet a friend

00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:39.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then leaving before he arrived.

00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:43.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was our question,
so we should wait for the answer.

00:04:43.654 --> 00:04:47.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait for it, not in a way
that makes people feel uncomfortable,

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:50.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by listening kindly.

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:53.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By listening, we, in effect, say,

00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:57.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are important to me.”

00:04:57.252 --> 00:05:00.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, unlike Jesus, we don’t already know
what’s going on inside of people,

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:04.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s not until they
answer our question

00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can tailor our comments
to fit their situation.

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:10.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:14.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a disciple-maker
uses questions skillfully.

00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:33.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The shower is free!

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:11.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are sisters, we are brothers,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sons and daughters, and more.”

00:06:51.623 --> 00:06:52.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo!

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:55.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give me a truth.

00:06:55.335 --> 00:06:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, what?

00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:59.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your sign says “Learn Bible Truths,”

00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:01.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I assume

00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:04.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re here to share said truths.

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:05.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So share one.

00:07:05.513 --> 00:07:07.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name’s Neeta.
What’s yours?

00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:09.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade.

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the stone?

00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:15.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like I’m jaded.

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:19.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to share something,
or what?

00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:22.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, yeah.

00:07:22.114 --> 00:07:24.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know the Bible says
you can live forever?

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heaven?

00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:27.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that what you’re sharing?

00:07:27.703 --> 00:07:30.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not exactly new, is it?

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:34.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says
that you can live forever on earth?

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why would I want that?
This place is a mess.

00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it won’t be in the future.

00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:43.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 21:4 promises:

00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will wipe out

00:07:45.472 --> 00:07:49.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every tear from their eyes,
and death will be no more,

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“neither will mourning
nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:55.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since there’s no death
or pain in heaven,

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where would this promise apply?

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth.

00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:09.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know the Bible said that.

00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:12.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wicked!

00:08:14.753 --> 00:08:15.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that’s cool.

00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:17.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, OK.

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:19.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to learn
how to be part of that future?

00:08:20.592 --> 00:08:23.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah.
Uh, thanks.

00:08:24.013 --> 00:08:27.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, I’m not really
the churchy type, and I’m— I’m late.

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So see you later.

00:08:34.107 --> 00:08:38.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Neeta
prefaced some of her questions?

00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:40.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know?

00:08:40.238 --> 00:08:44.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know the Bible
says you can live forever?

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:48.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I mean did you know the Bible says
you can live forever on earth?”

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:53.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a thought-provoking question
to get the conversation started.

00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:57.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe it’s been a little while since you
were able to stand in a public place

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a witnessing cart,
as we saw Neeta doing here,

00:09:00.343 --> 00:09:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can have conversations
on the phone,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps in stores,
or in the park.

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions also work well in letters.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s easy for us to think
of questions on topics that interest us,

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:17.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what is needed is to think of questions

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others will enjoy answering.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such questions as:

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:27.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know that the Bible describes
a time when sickness will be no more?

00:09:28.164 --> 00:09:32.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think we’ll ever see
true economic security?

“It would be nice to be able to plan.

“What do you think is a reliable source
of information about the future?

“Do you think we could be living

“I’ve noticed that many people still pray,
especially when they have problems.

“Do you think anyone
listens to prayers?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God listen to all prayers?”

Viewpoint questions
—viewpoint questions invite people

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:03.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express their thoughts.

00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:06.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often Jesus would pause,

00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:11.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask people what they thought,
and then listen to their response.

00:10:11.126 --> 00:10:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after the death
of Martha’s brother Lazarus,

00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:19.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told her
as recorded at John 11:25, 26:

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:24.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone who is living and exercises faith
in me will never die at all.”

00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:26.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he asked her:

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:30.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe this?”

00:10:31.523 --> 00:10:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe this?”

00:10:34.818 --> 00:10:38.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he listened
as she expressed her faith.

00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:43.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This type of question can be very effective
in our disciple-making work.

00:10:43.327 --> 00:10:45.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or like Jesus,

00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:48.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can use a series of questions
to help people reason.

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:52.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video, did you notice
how after reading Revelation 21:4,

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:57.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta asked Jade,
“Since there’s no death or pain in heaven,

00:10:57.216 --> 00:11:01.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where would this promise apply?”
and then she asks,

00:11:01.346 --> 00:11:05.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to learn
how to be a part of that future?”

00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:10.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We improve our skills
by imitating Jesus.

00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:14.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as our skill improves,
our joy increases.

00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:18.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus delighted to make disciples,
and we can too.

00:11:18.698 --> 00:11:22.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By asking questions
and then listening to people’s answers,

00:11:22.743 --> 00:11:25.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may help some of them
to accept the good news

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will definitely experience firsthand

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy of disciple-making.

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:35.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Patrick LaFranca,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next part of this symposium,

00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:42.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making
—Improve Your Skills—

00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:45.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unleashing the Power of God’s Word.”

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:06.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For anyone to become
a servant of Jehovah,

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they must have God’s Word
deeply implanted in their heart.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is it so necessary
for us to understand that,

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:20.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what skills will help us
to reach the heart of our students?

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave an indication
in his illustration of the sower.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found in Matthew chapter 13,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 19.

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:19, it says:

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where anyone hears the word
of the Kingdom

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:42.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but does not get the sense of it,
the wicked one comes

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:46.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and snatches away
what has been sown in his heart.”

00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:51.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So “the word of the Kingdom”
is likened to seeds,

00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:55.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the soil,
to the figurative heart.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:59.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the figurative heart
represents what a person is inside.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:04.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involves his feelings, his affections,
his desires, his motives,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also what he thinks about

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how those thoughts
affect decisions in his life.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:14.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look back at verse 19,
Jesus said that the seed, in this case,

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:17.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t grow because the individual

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:20.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t “get the sense” of the good news.

00:01:20.772 --> 00:01:23.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus has given
all of us this assignment

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples of people
of all the nations, baptizing them.”

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:32.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our teaching needs to help our students

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“get the sense” of the good news,

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s going to move them to action.

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:40.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 3:1

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:45.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlights the importance
of this type of teaching to us.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:50.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Proverbs 3:1.

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:54.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “My son,
do not forget my teaching,

00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may your heart observe
my commandments.”

00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:00.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So obedience to God

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must come from the heart,
as it indicates.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:07.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brothers and sisters,
it’s our responsibility

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:11.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn how to reach
the heart of our students

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:14.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that their thinking, their feelings,

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:19.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their reasonings will move them
to be obedient to Jehovah God.

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:22.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how Neeta strives
to reach the heart of her Bible student.

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think any more
about what we talked about on Monday?

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did.

00:02:35.977 --> 00:02:39.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why would Jehovah
make a rule like that

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:41.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no sex unless you’re married?

00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:42.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s totally archaic.

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:45.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might seem odd,

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:48.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what quality do you
most appreciate about Jehovah?

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:51.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His love.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:55.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if he truly loves us,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48:17:

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[<i>your</i> God, Jade]

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One teaching you

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:14.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to benefit yourself,

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.”

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I don’t get it.

00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just— It just doesn’t make sense.

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:31.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Question: Does a little child

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:35.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always understand why Mum and Dad
warn them not to do certain things?

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:38.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably not.

00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:41.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why all the rules and warnings?

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they love them, don’t they?

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if Jehovah loves you . . . ?

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It often takes time to appreciate
why Jehovah asks certain things of us.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we really love him,

00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:07.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have faith that what he asks

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:10.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is for the best.

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:18.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The real question is, Do you trust him?

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:22.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to;

00:04:25.551 --> 00:04:27.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really do.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:38.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a good example
of how a Bible study conductor

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:41.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reaches the heart of a student.

00:04:41.652 --> 00:04:44.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta was calmly helping Jade

00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:48.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to link what she was learning in her study

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to her relationship with Jehovah God.

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:54.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not an intellectual exercise,
so to speak,

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping her to gain more knowledge
about a certain subject.

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:03.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s really helping the student
to connect the dots, so to speak,

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:06.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how the material applies to decisions

00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:08.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are making in their life.

00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:11.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the Bible study,
we want

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:15.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to constantly direct attention
to Jehovah God.

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re talking too much as the teacher,

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:21.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to be hard to accomplish that.

00:05:21.068 --> 00:05:24.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your effective use of questions

00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:28.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help them connect
the Bible knowledge that they are receiving

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:33.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the qualities of Jehovah God
—that’s going to make them love him—

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities such as his love,

00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his goodness, and his righteousness.

00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:44.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example of a question
that might be used:

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:49.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think Jehovah
would forbid . . . (a certain action)?

00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:53.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that kind of question
is helping your student

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begin to understand

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the thinking of Jehovah God on matters.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:03.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice it was
not a yes-or-no question?

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:07.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question actually started with “why.”

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now that forces the student

00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:13.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go to another level
of their thought process

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:17.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to explain the reason Jehovah
forbids certain actions,

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s a very good method

00:06:20.131 --> 00:06:23.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of reaching the heart of a student.

00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example of another question:

00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:31.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does this show you
that Jehovah is a loving Father?

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There again, it’s not a yes-or-no question.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time it started with “how,”

00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:42.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that now requires
the student to identify the evidence

00:06:42.696 --> 00:06:46.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that proves
that Jehovah is a loving Father.

00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:49.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in the video

00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:53.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Neeta’s questions
were touching Jade’s heart?

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:56.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was skilled at her choice of questions

00:06:56.795 --> 00:07:01.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in the tone of voice she used
when she was asking those questions.

00:07:01.383 --> 00:07:05.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was not hurried
or impatient to get an answer.

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:10.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She quietly waited for Jade
to meditate on the question.

00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:14.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her method of teaching
demonstrated a Bible principle

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be helpful for us to review,
and it’s found in Proverbs

00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:23.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 20, and verse 5.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 20:5,

00:07:29.663 --> 00:07:34.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “The thoughts of a man’s heart
are like deep waters,

00:07:34.668 --> 00:07:38.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the discerning man draws them out.”

00:07:38.505 --> 00:07:40.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the thoughts of the student

00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:44.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not always easily discernible.

00:07:44.053 --> 00:07:47.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it really takes a skilled teacher

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw those out “like deep waters,”
the verse indicates.

00:07:52.854 --> 00:07:56.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through tactful questions, then,
you can help your student

00:07:56.817 --> 00:07:59.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to examine how they feel

00:07:59.903 --> 00:08:02.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what they are learning.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:05.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some simple questions will help you do that.

00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:10.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, How do you feel about . . . ?

00:08:10.247 --> 00:08:14.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or What convinces you that . . . ?

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:19.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or How would you react if . . . ?

00:08:19.048 --> 00:08:21.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, those are excellent questions

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:25.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help to draw up the inner feelings
of your student.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s a caution in this process

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because generally it’s going to take time

00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:33.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gain the trust of the student

00:08:33.272 --> 00:08:36.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they’ll be comfortable
expressing their feelings.

00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:40.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a student’s love for Jehovah increases,

00:08:40.947 --> 00:08:44.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll be motivated
to make changes in their lives

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:47.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to please Jehovah God.

00:08:47.662 --> 00:08:50.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 5:3 says:

00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:53.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what the love of God means,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we observe his commandments.”

00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:00.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So obedience to his commandments, then,

00:09:00.551 --> 00:09:03.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is linked to love for him and,

00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:06.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in addition, love for fellow humans.

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:10.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love for the Bible teachings
that they’re learning is going to help

00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:14.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
them to make any needed adjustments
to their thinking.

00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:17.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than shame your student,

00:09:17.193 --> 00:09:19.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help them to reason

00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:23.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the benefits
of correcting wrong viewpoints.

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall how Neeta
handled the situation with Jade?

00:09:28.664 --> 00:09:33.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jade said Jehovah’s law
against having sex before marriage

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:36.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was “totally archaic,”

00:09:36.714 --> 00:09:40.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of scolding her,

00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:44.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta skillfully used an example of a child

00:09:44.264 --> 00:09:48.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not understanding the rules
and regulations of the parent.

00:09:48.768 --> 00:09:51.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you could see as she was discussing that,

00:09:51.563 --> 00:09:56.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade started to make the connection
that Jehovah’s law

00:09:56.401 --> 00:10:00.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is really an expression of his love for her,

00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:04.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as a parent loves their child.

00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:09.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once a student develops
this relationship with Jehovah God

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:13.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and desires to make Jehovah’s heart happy,

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:17.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to be the strongest motive

00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:21.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the individual to make
whatever changes are necessary

00:10:21.303 --> 00:10:23.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their life to please Jehovah.

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:30.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it is a privilege to be involved
in the work of making disciples,

00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:34.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to also enjoy this work.

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:38.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was certainly the case
with the apostle Paul.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bible to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:45.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 19 and 20.

00:10:45.036 --> 00:10:49.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s see how he felt
about God’s message

00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:53.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changing the lives
of those who he preached to.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20:

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For what is our hope
or joy or crown of exaltation

00:11:03.305 --> 00:11:06.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before our Lord Jesus at his presence?

00:11:06.058 --> 00:11:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it not in fact you?

00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:13.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You certainly are our glory and joy.”

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:18.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Few joys in life can compare
with helping someone come

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:22.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an accurate knowledge of the truth
and watching them progress

00:11:22.993 --> 00:11:26.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedication and baptism.

00:11:26.246 --> 00:11:30.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so thankful to receive
Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:11:30.918 --> 00:11:35.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his guidance in helping us
in this disciple-making work.

00:11:35.506 --> 00:11:38.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we too must do our part

00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:42.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in diligently improving in our skills.

00:11:42.722 --> 00:11:46.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As this six-part symposium has highlighted,

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:51.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we do our part
improving our teaching skills

00:11:51.398 --> 00:11:53.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all aspects of our ministry,

00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:56.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will find greater joy

00:11:56.737 --> 00:11:59.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “God’s fellow workers.”

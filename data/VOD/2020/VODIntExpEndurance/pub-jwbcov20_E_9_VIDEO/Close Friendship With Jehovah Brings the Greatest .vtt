I’ve had a lifelong struggle
with a negative attitude.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My negative disposition

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a very impatient,

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sarcastic, and demanding person.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, out in field service,
I had insulted a partner of mine,

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the entire day was ruined.

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother was in the car.

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:28.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very upset with the situation.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She told me that I had a negative attitude

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was not allowed inside the house
until that sister forgave me.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked the sister to lunch.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one of the most difficult
and uncomfortable situations I have been in.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to make a self-examination.

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:53.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was I negative?
Why was I so unhappy?

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because I stopped pioneering

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my friends continued
in their full-time service to Jehovah.

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that made me very frustrated,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them continue this while I was stuck.

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I acknowledged
that I had this negative attitude,

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prompted me to beg Jehovah
to help me to make changes.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends in the congregation who I spent
a lot of time with were not bad people.

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their imperfection
fueled my negative attitude,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really had to put that fire out.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Personal study was a major help,
along with my prayers to Jehovah,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make these changes.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that I meditated on
was how Jesus acted with his disciples.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was hungry and he was tired,

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still very loving and kind.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:45.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I saw for myself
that when I was spiritually hungry,

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that affected my words and my actions
toward the brothers and sisters.

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The keys to maintaining
Jesus’ mental disposition are prayer,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gratitude, and contentment.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My goal is to show

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a grateful attitude
for the blessings that I receive

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day and also to look

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the good in people
—to show them that I care and I love them.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve learned that the more that I
give to the friends

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to my family,
the happier that makes Jehovah,

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Acts 20:35
and Hebrews 13:16 mention.

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jehovah is happy,
that really makes me happy.

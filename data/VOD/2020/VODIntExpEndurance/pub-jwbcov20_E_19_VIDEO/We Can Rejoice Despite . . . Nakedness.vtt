Well, one thing you have to understand
about living in New York City

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it’s a very fast-paced life.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve got to keep up with that lifestyle.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were doing pretty fine,

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were happy pioneering, working

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just trying to survive in New York.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that you
usually have to worry about

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is your safety
—being careful of your surroundings.

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But hurricanes are just something
we never considered;

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s something we
never had to worry about.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day when we first heard the warning,

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was raining outside and kind of windy.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw the water coming into the parking lot
where our apartment was

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s when I realized
something was about to happen.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got out with the clothes on our back.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just total devastation.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You lose everything

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one single night.

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:20.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had any thought that water

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:23.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would come into our place and destroy
everything from our material possessions

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our clothes.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I truly felt
what it was like to be destitute.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just broke my heart.

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:31.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all I could do

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was wonder, ‘Where do my wife
and I go from here?’

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:40.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assembly was scheduled for that weekend.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even have

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a suit jacket or a tie.

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I probably took for granted
something as simple as clothing.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had it.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers and sisters stepped in
to assist in so many different ways.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard a knock on the door that Friday

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—three suits

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shoes!

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They purchased clothing for us.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a most unbelievable experience.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These friends gave us big hugs
and gave us envelopes.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were clothed by Jehovah’s love.

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:22.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to go to our assembly
and enjoy taking in spiritual food,

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we were in that situation.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we lost everything physically,

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were still able to keep on pioneering,
which we have been doing up to this day.

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made a promise.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep seeking
first his Kingdom,

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:42.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything else he will take care of.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where my joy comes from.

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what type of tribulation
you go through in your life,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even if it’s to the point of nakedness,

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will never ever be able to stop

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:59.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or cut off the relationship
that we have with our God, Jehovah.

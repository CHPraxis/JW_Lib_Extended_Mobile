00:00:08 I was born in Malawi in 1962.
00:00:12 I lost my eyesight at two years of age because of an eye disease.
00:00:19 We have to rely on the rains for the food we eat and sell,
00:00:23 as it is our only source of income.
00:00:27 I also look after both my parents.
00:00:29 My father is 99 years old,
00:00:32 and my mother is 92 years old.
00:00:35 Poverty is very time-consuming.
00:00:39 There are a lot of household chores to do
00:00:43 to keep things clean and neat,
00:00:46 like fetching water for our daily needs.
00:00:50 In the evening, after we have eaten, this is the time for reading.
00:00:54 When I was young, Father took the lead in our family worship,
00:00:59 which he still does.
00:01:01 But now because of his failing eyesight,
00:01:03 I read to them.
00:01:05 I read with my fingers,
00:01:07 so nighttime is no problem.
00:01:10 My fingers are my eyes.
00:01:14 One scripture that really touches my heart
00:01:17 is James 5:11, which says:
00:01:20 “Look!
00:01:21 “We consider happy
00:01:23 those who have endured.”
00:01:25 Job endured his trials,
00:01:27 and at the end,
00:01:28 he saw all the good that Jehovah had blessed him with.
00:01:31 This convinces me
00:01:34 that Jehovah will act in the near future,
00:01:36 blessing us with all the things that we are lacking,
00:01:39 fulfilling all his promises.
00:01:41 And so I’m happy to endure.
00:01:46 God’s Kingdom and his sovereignty are first in my life.
00:01:50 It is only God’s Kingdom that will solve all these problems.
00:01:57 I feel privileged that I’ve been able to serve as a regular pioneer
00:02:01 for 36 years now and have been blessed
00:02:04 to help 64 persons to know Jehovah.
00:02:09 I’m so happy with song 76.
00:02:21 I don’t see myself as poor.
00:02:23 I have the Bible and many  different publications in Chichewa Braille.
00:02:28 We have the congregation, the ministry, and our brothers and sisters.
00:02:33 All these things make me very happy!
00:02:37 We are not worried about our current situation
00:02:40 because we are spiritually rich.

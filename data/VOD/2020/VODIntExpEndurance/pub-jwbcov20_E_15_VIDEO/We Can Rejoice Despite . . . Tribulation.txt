00:00:08 For  the last 45 years, I’ve been in the pioneer work,
00:00:13 traveling work,
00:00:18 and in Bethel here for a number of years.
00:00:22 My health was very good
00:00:25 —never had any problems at all.
00:00:30 One day, I had a headache.
00:00:32 It was severe.
00:00:34 I really couldn’t see clearly—anything.
00:00:40 We went to the Bethel doctor, and he referred us to a specialist,
00:00:44 and the specialist gave us the diagnosis
00:00:46 of a very aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma.
00:00:53 He had surgery the next Thursday.
00:00:58 Then, after surgery, he had radiation
00:01:01 and chemotherapy at the same time.
00:01:05 A year later, he had to have another surgery.
00:01:09 And right now he is on his fourth type
00:01:13 of chemotherapy treatment.
00:01:17 From the very first time that he got sick, the hardest thing
00:01:20 was to see my husband become increasingly dependent
00:01:24 upon me and upon other people.
00:01:28 I didn’t want this
00:01:30 to define who we are.
00:01:36 The brothers played a pivotal role
00:01:38 and tried to help us.
00:01:41 One brother found out that I had to go in for surgery.
00:01:45 He gave me a scripture,
00:01:47 and we prayed together.
00:01:50 I’ll always remember that.
00:01:52 It was a beautiful example.
00:01:56 I also get a lot of encouragement from Sara,
00:02:00 who gets us prepared for meetings.
00:02:05 When we go out in service, I’ve gotten the opportunity
00:02:09 to go and help people
00:02:13 —just talk to them and encourage them.
00:02:19 In my Bethel assignment
00:02:22 in the Service Department, I have a brother or two
00:02:26 who will come over and review a case
00:02:29 that we’re considering, and I get a lot of joy in that way.
00:02:34 I’m very thankful that I can still do a little something
00:02:39 to help.
00:02:42 For me,
00:02:44 because he’s been humble through this whole thing, it’s been easier.
00:02:51 My hope is strong, and I’m going to keep
00:02:54 right on going this way and serve Jehovah
00:02:57 right on into the new world or whatever comes.

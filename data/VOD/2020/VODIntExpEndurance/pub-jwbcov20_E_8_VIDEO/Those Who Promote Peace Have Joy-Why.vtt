00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.942 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I got married in 2002.

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:06.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Around that time,

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:08.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was appointed a ministerial servant,

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:10.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife and I
were serving as regular pioneers.

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2004,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were given the opportunity
to serve as special pioneers.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was something that we really wanted

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we wanted to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we got that assignment,

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:27.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were delighted.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in the congregation
were also very happy for us.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But everything did not go smoothly.

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time went on,
I faced some difficult situations.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I was not appointed
as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation,

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two brothers who had served
as ministerial servants

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a shorter time than I had
were appointed as elders.

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that those brothers 
did not have as much experience as I had.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘I am the one with the experience,

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so why didn’t I get appointed?’

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:10.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to question my own qualifications,

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this made me very sad.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the two brothers were appointed,

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to dislike them.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also angry with them,

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the anger even progressed

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little toward hatred.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real challenge for me
to serve in that congregation.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attending meetings was difficult;

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would go with a heavy heart.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I put a lot of effort
into making personal changes

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—changing my attitude
and getting rid of my negative traits.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that if I did nothing,

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was going to affect the worship
I gave to Jehovah

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the relationship with my brothers.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
could end up completely losing our joy.

00:01:56.553 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to make things right,
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:04.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent time in deep, personal Bible study.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife would also find articles

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about maintaining peace with the brothers

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would give them to me to read.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She even selected Kingdom songs
that dealt with maintaining peace,

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she would sing them to me.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a lot of changes to my attitude
and worked hard to progress

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a person whom Jehovah would approve.

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to view my brothers

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same way Jehovah did
and to serve him with joy.

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wanted to give
my best to Jehovah and to the brothers.

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time, I did not want

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those wrong thoughts
to ever come back into my heart.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The valuable lesson that I have learned

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that privileges are not most important.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it is serving Jehovah
that brings genuine happiness.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I am finding
real joy and satisfaction

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my service to Jehovah.

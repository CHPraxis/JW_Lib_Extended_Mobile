00:00:07 I pray for my brothers and sisters every day
00:00:12 because I know Jehovah is the Hearer of prayer.
00:00:23 Ever since our baptism,
00:00:26 we as a family were fully engaged in Christian activities.
00:00:35 It was a busy yet fulfilling life.
00:00:42 I really loved preaching.
00:00:45 I enjoyed conducting Bible studies
00:00:47 and talking to others about the truth.
00:00:52 At one point, I was the only elder in the congregation.
00:00:56 I tried to make shepherding calls on everyone,
00:01:01 but I just did not have the time,
00:01:05 so I developed the habit
00:01:07 of praying for them many times during the day.
00:01:12 I would mention them individually by name.
00:01:15 I wanted Jehovah to protect
00:01:19 his precious sheep from Satan’s attacks.
00:01:26 Some time later,
00:01:29 my wife fell seriously ill.
00:01:33 After being hospitalized for a while,
00:01:35 I decided to take care of her at home.
00:01:40 I needed to step down from pioneering.
00:01:44 Kuniko served Jehovah faithfully until her death.
00:01:51 After a while, I became sick as well.
00:01:55 One morning, I felt especially bad and couldn’t move.
00:02:12 Fortunately, I managed to survive somehow,
00:02:16 but now I’m confined to a wheelchair.
00:02:20 I can no longer walk in the ministry as I used to
00:02:23 or handle congregation responsibilities.
00:02:28 I need help to change clothes and take a shower.
00:02:32 I get really depressed
00:02:34 when I think of the times when I was able to move around freely.
00:02:47 But Jehovah never forgets the love we’ve shown.
00:02:52 He is pleased to see us doing our very best
00:02:56 in whatever circumstances we are in.
00:03:01 I am limited in what I can do, but I can still pray.
00:03:07 In my prayers, I mention
00:03:10 the names of those in my congregation
00:03:12 and my personal friends.
00:03:14 I make a list of their names so as not to forget anyone.
00:03:20 Through jw.org®,
00:03:22 I read about the brothers in Russia being arrested
00:03:25 and the situation in Eritrea,
00:03:28 so I make sure to include them in my prayers.
00:03:33 The Governing Body and its helpers and those in full-time service
00:03:37 also need Jehovah’s support.
00:03:42 Jehovah is without a doubt the Hearer of prayer.
00:03:47 When I was the only elder in the congregation
00:03:51 and when my wife was sick in bed,
00:03:54 he listened to my prayers.
00:04:00 So I am confident that the prayers that I offer
00:04:03 will help my fellow friends.
00:04:09 Now I do what I can in service,
00:04:13 such as witnessing to caregivers.
00:04:15 When I meet those whom I have not seen for a long time
00:04:19 and tell them “I’ve been praying for you,”
00:04:22 they often tell me how it has really helped them.
00:04:25 Some even shed tears out of gratitude.
00:04:27 I feel happy too.
00:04:33 Although I’m getting physically weaker every day,
00:04:36 my prayers are becoming
00:04:38 more and more meaningful.
00:04:41 I want to cherish this precious gift of prayer
00:04:45 that Jehovah has given us
00:04:47 as long as I live.

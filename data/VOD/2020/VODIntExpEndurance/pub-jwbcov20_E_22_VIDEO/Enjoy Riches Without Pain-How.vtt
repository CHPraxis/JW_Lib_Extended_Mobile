00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:10.114 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought happiness was all about money

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:12.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and getting to buy whatever I wanted.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really into fashion.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was always thinking
about what I was going to get next,

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t mind
putting in extra overtime to get it.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My day ended with me
taking the last train home, eating,

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then going to bed
at one or two o’clock in the morning.

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this affected me
mentally and physically.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d wake up in the middle
of the night with panic attacks.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so lost and confused.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I’d worked for
was for nothing.

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:04.084 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My motto for shopping was,

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“When in doubt, buy!”

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bought a lot of things:
powerful motorcycles, a house, cars.

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was totally absorbed in work
and sometimes worked all night.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I somehow made it to meetings,

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but after they ended,
I’d leave right away.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t show interest in anyone,
not even my wife.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I ever talked about was work,

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I showed a real lack
of consideration for my wife.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really blunt with her,

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:43.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there was a constant
back and forth between us.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had a strained relationship.

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t happy.

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just felt stress,
stress, and more stress.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything seemed pointless.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I hadn’t been caring

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for myself on the inside,

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:16.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided
to read the Bible all over again.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was especially moved

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by how Jehovah repeatedly tried 
to help the Israelites

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite all their failures.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminded me
that Jehovah had been expressing

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his love for me all along.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t hold back my tears.

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided that I’d live
the rest of my life for him.

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I adjusted my work

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:51.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made the ministry
the focal point in my life.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I get to share a Bible scripture

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone and see it
make an impact on them,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel truly happy.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw some brothers
from the congregation

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
playing soccer with a young boy
who had just lost his father.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were trying to comfort him
by spending time with him.

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:22.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw them
showing personal interest in someone

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and considering others’ feelings,

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really impressed me and I thought,

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:31.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want to use my time like that as well.’

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture in the Bible says:

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I practiced it,
the happier I became.

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:43.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became convinced
that this really is the truth.

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when my wife and I
spend time together,

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m better able to really understand her,

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:54.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve come to realize
how much she means to me.

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so thankful that Jehovah
has taught me the truth.

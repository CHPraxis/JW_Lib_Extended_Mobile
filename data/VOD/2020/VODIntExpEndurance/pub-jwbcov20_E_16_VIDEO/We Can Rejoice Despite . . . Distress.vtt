We knew when we first got married
that we would enjoy having a family.

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we first found out 

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we were pregnant,
we were overjoyed.

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Becky first told me she was pregnant,

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like a light switch
went off in my heart.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, I felt like a dad.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instantly, you begin to make plans.

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like all this love

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just flooded in.

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Becky was feeling a little off,

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a friend encouraged us,
“Just go see the doctor.”

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we did.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while we were there,
they did an ultrasound.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctor came back

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:54.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said
there wasn’t a heartbeat anymore.

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very difficult moment

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something I can never forget.

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:09.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because all of a sudden, all of those hopes,

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those dreams,
those preparations you are making

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they’re gone.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This place in your heart
that opened up to make room for this child

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now this huge, gaping, open hole

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s nothing to fill it.

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:39.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just is incredible emptiness.

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know what to do.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was a meeting night,

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we wanted to go to the meeting.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like the place
where Jehovah’s holy spirit is,

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wanted to be there
because we knew

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were not going to be able
to survive this on our own strength.

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed Jehovah.

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:05.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After people learned
that we had lost

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the baby, so many people

00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:09.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared a little bit
of their experiences with me,

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made us feel not alone,
for sure.

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has also given us
some incredible friends

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—friends who have stuck closer to us

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a brother,
friends who always seem to know

00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:25.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re having a hard day,
who have prayed with us,

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:29.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have taken walks with us, listened.

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know those are expressions
Jehovah has given us.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:39.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regaining joy
is a work in progress.

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:42.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a particular scripture
in my personal study

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I found very helpful,
Psalm 139, where it talks

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how there’s nowhere

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can’t find us.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no darkness
that is too dark for Jehovah.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt
like such a dark place.

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dwelling on that scripture
was something that helped me a lot.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gradually, bit by bit,

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like Jehovah did help me

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see beautiful things again.

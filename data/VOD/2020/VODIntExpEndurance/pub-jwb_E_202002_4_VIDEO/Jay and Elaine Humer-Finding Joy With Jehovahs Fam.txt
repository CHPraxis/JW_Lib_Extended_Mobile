00:00:01 Full-time service is a special way to serve Jehovah
00:00:05 with a joyful heart.
00:00:07 But what happens to your joy when you suddenly face a serious trial?
00:00:12 Jay and Elaine Humer, you have been through this.
00:00:15 Thank you for being here today
00:00:17 to share your personal experience with us.
00:00:21 You’ve enjoyed full-time service for over 40 years,
00:00:24 many of those years in the traveling work.
00:00:27 Yes, we’ve had the wonderful privilege of both pioneering
00:00:30 and serving in the traveling work for 30 years now.
00:00:33 And we really feel that Jehovah has been very kind to allow us to serve him this way.
00:00:38 I remember when I first filled out my application
00:00:42 for regular pioneering back in 1972,
00:00:44 and I thought this was my gift to Jehovah—my sacrifice.
00:00:48 But after the many years
00:00:50 of the blessings and the privileges
00:00:52 and how Jehovah helped us through some very difficult times,
00:00:56 what I thought was my gift to Jehovah turned out to be his gift to me.
00:01:01 This is very encouraging. Thank you.
00:01:02 Now, you mentioned “difficult times.”
00:01:05 Is there anything in particular you can think of?
00:01:08 One of the hardest things that we faced was about 20 years ago
00:01:11 when we experienced seven deaths in just a six-month period.
00:01:15 This really was difficult because five of those seven were family members.
00:01:20 Jay’s father died,
00:01:22 my aunt Alma (who brought me into the truth) died, and my father died.
00:01:26 So it just seemed like one layer on top of another.
00:01:30 We can hardly imagine how you must have felt.
00:01:33 Now, after such a Job-like experience,
00:01:36 what did you do in order to regain your joy and happiness?
00:01:39 Well, it didn’t occur automatically.
00:01:41 We kept focused, of course, on serving the friends
00:01:46 and working with them, and that kept our thoughts
00:01:48 from constantly circling around our losses.
00:01:50 We also thought about the resurrection.
00:01:52 We focused on the resurrection hope
00:01:54 and, as we did, it became like “the helmet of salvation,”
00:01:57 protecting our hearts and our thoughts from the grief that we were going through.
00:02:02 And then, of course, we shared our hope with others,
00:02:04 and that helped us to have it more deeply engraved on our own hearts as well.
00:02:08 Thank you.
00:02:09 So now, may we learn from you what you did in practical terms?
00:02:14 The most difficult of all was about four years after that
00:02:19 when our beloved nephew Christopher
00:02:21 was killed in an auto accident at the age of 17.
00:02:24 He and his parents had lived with us in the same house
00:02:28 for a number of years before we went on the road.
00:02:30 And we always looked at Christopher like the son
00:02:32 that we would never have on this side of Armageddon.
00:02:34 So his death was particularly tragic.
00:02:38 It was excruciating for all of our family members, especially his parents.
00:02:43 Christopher was on his way to the Kingdom Hall
00:02:45 to meet his papa and his grandmother for field service,
00:02:49 and his car hit a patch of ice and slid into an oncoming car.
00:02:54 He died instantly.
00:02:56 This was so difficult for us.
00:02:58 Our hearts were broken, and our spirits were nearly crushed.
00:03:02 It actually rendered me speechless,
00:03:04 even to beg for the “groanings unuttered” became very difficult.
00:03:09 I didn’t speak to Jehovah for three days,
00:03:12 but I was listening.
00:03:14 What do you mean by “listening”?
00:03:16 I remember when we were all together as a family,
00:03:20 and my sister just happened to say that Christopher had been cremated.
00:03:24 We were there making arrangements for the funeral,
00:03:27 and it just hit me so hard.
00:03:30 It was just—it just hit hard enough
00:03:33 that I fell down, and I just cried.
00:03:36 I laid there on the floor, and I thought,
00:03:39 perhaps, maybe Mary felt this way when she said:
00:03:42 ‘Lord, if you’d only been here this wouldn’t have happened.’
00:03:47 But as I laid there, I could hear my sister say:
00:03:50 “Go get her Bible.
00:03:51 Read her her favorite scripture.”
00:03:53 And so Jay did.
00:03:54 He turned to Psalm 91, a psalm that I had already memorized,
00:03:59 and now I began to hear Jehovah’s voice.
00:04:02 So was this listening to Jehovah a onetime occurrence?
00:04:07 No, by no means.
00:04:09 I really had to now do my research.
00:04:11 So I searched for every article on the resurrection,
00:04:15 I searched for every scripture on comfort,
00:04:17 and I meditated on the artwork —the pictures in the publications.
00:04:22 I remember one particular scripture that really touched my heart.
00:04:26 It was from Psalm 56:8.
00:04:29 And there it said: “You keep track of my wandering.
00:04:33 “Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.
00:04:36 Are they not recorded in your book?”
00:04:39 And I thought about Jehovah taking such notice of us
00:04:43 —keeping track, watching over, even collecting every tear
00:04:47 and recording each of them.
00:04:49 That truly made me draw close to Jehovah.
00:04:53 So you continued to listen to Jehovah
00:04:57 by looking at comforting material from the publications.
00:04:59 Was there any specific article you thought of?
00:05:03 There was an article.
00:05:05 It was about a delicate flower
00:05:07 that had been bent over after a rainstorm
00:05:10 —the kind of cloudburst that would send humans and animals running for shelter,
00:05:15 but not this flower.
00:05:17 Here it was intact,
00:05:19 bent over but unbroken and still rooted.
00:05:22 I thought about us in that same way.
00:05:25 The article said that we can no more avoid losing a loved one
00:05:30 than this flower could uproot itself and run for cover.
00:05:33 It had to endure.
00:05:35 But the article spoke a great deal about hope and about faith.
00:05:39 Hope is our anchor, and hope is our preserver of our spirituality.
00:05:44 And faith —James 1:3 stated there that faith—
00:05:49 when it succeeds, we’re able to endure.
00:05:53 And so that’s exactly what happened.
00:05:55 It softened the grief.
00:05:57 And so like this flower, we too would stand up and smile one day.
00:06:00 And we did.
00:06:02 I remember the first time I smiled inside, and I thought,
00:06:06 ‘Oh, Jehovah, you truly are a healer of hearts.’
00:06:10 So did you do something else?
00:06:12 Now I started looking for some of the artwork in the publications.
00:06:17 And one particular picture I found was of a shepherd
00:06:21 who had gone into a bramble bush and rescued a lamb.
00:06:25 He was lost.
00:06:26 He pulled him out, threw him over his shoulders, and held onto him.
00:06:30 And I thought, ‘What a safe place to be —such security!’
00:06:34 I decided to take the picture
00:06:36 and to print it out and just enlarge it a little bit.
00:06:40 But what I didn’t see on the publication page,
00:06:44 I saw when I enlarged it, and there were scratches on the shepherd’s face.
00:06:49 And I thought about what that shepherd had gone through
00:06:51 to go in the bramble bush and pull him out.
00:06:54 And then, I thought about Jehovah as our Great Shepherd
00:06:57 and the lengths that he went through to rescue us,
00:07:01 even at the cost of pain for himself.
00:07:04 Now I was listening and drawing close, back to Jehovah.
00:07:08 So, then, what did you do with these articles and the pictures?
00:07:13 So now I decided to print them all out
00:07:15 —the articles, the pictures, and the scriptures—
00:07:20 and I displayed them on my desk for quite some time.
00:07:23 But then I put them in a big envelope (or like a file),
00:07:26 and I thought that was Jehovah’s sympathy card to me.
00:07:31 We knew that we had to do something so as not to be swept away by our grief.
00:07:35 It’s been said that grief is an arduous journey, but one that we cannot avoid.
00:07:39 It’s not a place where we live but a passage, as it were.
00:07:43 And we know that even though grief never goes away, it does change over time.
00:07:47 That’s because Jehovah made our hearts to heal.
00:07:50 And so, in time, that’s what we did.
00:07:52 Yeah, we sure did.
00:07:53 It’s not about the lack of faith; it’s simply the price of love.
00:07:57 We loved Christopher, and we miss him.
00:08:00 It wasn’t like we were leaving him behind.
00:08:02 Sometimes that’s how you feel when you lose a loved one.
00:08:05 But in reality, we know that Christopher is in Jehovah’s memory.
00:08:09 And as the righteous God, Jehovah never forgets his loyal ones.
00:08:12 Christopher was one of them.
00:08:14 So we’re confident that we’re going to see him again.
00:08:17 And that’s what helps us not to be, as it were,
00:08:20 always looking in the rearview mirror
00:08:22 but looking ahead to the time when we will be with him in Paradise.
00:08:27 You know, Jehovah truly kept his promises, and he carried us through that storm.
00:08:32 He gathered up the pieces of our broken hearts and sealed them.
00:08:36 And even though this happened 17 years ago,
00:08:39 sure, we still have cracks in our hearts.
00:08:42 But we know for a certainty that those one day will disappear as well
00:08:46 in the Paradise when we welcome him back home.
00:08:49 And so, Jehovah truly proved to be my stronghold,
00:08:53 my Father, and my Friend in a profound way.
00:08:57 We learned that Jehovah truly does love us, cares for us, and protects us.
00:09:02 And because he is such a good Father,
00:09:05 our joy has come back and we have had such a rich life.
00:09:09 So in all the years that we’ve had the privilege of serving our God,
00:09:13 we’ve always found that no matter what we give Jehovah,
00:09:15 no matter what sacrifices we make for him, he always gives us more.
00:09:19 You cannot out generous the most generous Person in the universe.
00:09:23 And so, just as he has blessed us all these many years,
00:09:26 we are confident that he will continue to bless us
00:09:29 as we transition to our next assignment.
00:09:32 Thank you so much for sharing your personal experiences with us.
00:09:36 And may Jehovah continue to be with the two of you
00:09:39 as you now continue your full-time service as special pioneers.
00:09:44 And may you be able to apply the principles that you have just mentioned
00:09:48 so that Jehovah can continue to “guard your hearts.”
00:09:52 Thank you.

I had a stable job at a local resort,

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I later lost this job.

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to look for work,
but I was unsuccessful.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My savings ran out.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had run out of money
to buy gas for cooking.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like my world had ended.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did some research in the publications.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found that I was able to follow the example

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some brothers who had found
that they were able to start businesses

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using the skills and abilities that they had.

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to use a fishing net that I owned,

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go down to the sea (to the river),

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put the net out in the evening.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early in the morning,
I would go down

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be able to find fish
and crabs in the net.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:52.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not always get

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good catch, but by doing this,

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eventually I was able

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support my family during that time.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to cook outside on a fire.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about how I could help
my family to stay positive.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would sit together, and we

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would sing Kingdom songs
and play games together.

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I feel that Jehovah
blessed the efforts that I made.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:5

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that scripture reassured me 

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that as long as I didn’t compromise

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the important aspects of Jehovah’s worship,

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family’s needs would be cared for.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always admired the beauty
and power of the sea.

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:47.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of the One
who created the sea.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:52.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not hard for him to care
for just one small human like me.

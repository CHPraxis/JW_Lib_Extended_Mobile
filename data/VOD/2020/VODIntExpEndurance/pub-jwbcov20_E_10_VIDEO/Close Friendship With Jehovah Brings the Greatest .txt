00:00:01 I had a stable job at a local resort,
00:00:04 but I later lost this job.
00:00:07 I tried to look for work, but I was unsuccessful.
00:00:11 My savings ran out.
00:00:14 We had run out of money to buy gas for cooking.
00:00:17 It felt like my world had ended.
00:00:23 I did some research in the publications.
00:00:26 I found that I was able to follow the example
00:00:29 of some brothers who had found that they were able to start businesses
00:00:34 using the skills and abilities that they had.
00:00:37 I was able to use a fishing net that I owned,
00:00:40 go down to the sea (to the river),
00:00:43 and put the net out in the evening.
00:00:45 Early in the morning, I would go down
00:00:47 and be able to find fish and crabs in the net.
00:00:50 It was not easy.
00:00:52 I did not always get
00:00:54 a good catch, but by doing this,
00:00:57 eventually I was able
00:00:59 to support my family during that time.
00:01:02 We had to cook outside on a fire.
00:01:05 I thought about how I could help my family to stay positive.
00:01:10 We would sit together, and we
00:01:12 would sing Kingdom songs and play games together.
00:01:18 And I feel that Jehovah blessed the efforts that I made.
00:01:24 Hebrews 13:5
00:01:26 —that scripture reassured me
00:01:29 that as long as I didn’t compromise
00:01:32 the important aspects of Jehovah’s worship,
00:01:34 my family’s needs would be cared for.
00:01:39 I’ve always admired the beauty and power of the sea.
00:01:44 It reminds me of the One who created the sea.
00:01:47 It’s not hard for him to care for just one small human like me.

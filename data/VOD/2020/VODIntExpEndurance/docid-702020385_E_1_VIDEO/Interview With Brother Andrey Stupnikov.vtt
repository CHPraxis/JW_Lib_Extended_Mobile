The Krasnoyarsk
Zheleznodorozhny District Court

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has begun consideration of the criminal case

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Andrey Stupnikov, a peaceful believer

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accused of extremism.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.411 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He is accused of a crime

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:18.747 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
under Article 282.2(1)

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:19.915 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the Criminal Code

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—namely, organizing the activity
of an organization

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has been liquidated by a court decision

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:29.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for carrying out
so-called extremist activity.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:34.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrey Stupnikov was not one
of the founding members of such organizations

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was never a member
of any of their agencies.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The religion was not banned.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:43.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was specifically pointed out
by the court

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ruled to liquidate the legal entities.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the indictment states:

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Andrey Stupnikov took steps to maintain

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and increase the number of followers

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the said religious teaching.”

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a religion cannot exist without followers

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who profess certain beliefs.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrey and Olga

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been married for 27 years.

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:09.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say that Bible knowledge
makes their life strong and happy.

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on July 3, 2018,

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their happy family life was disrupted

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Andrey was detained
by the Federal Security Service (FSB).

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I arrived at the airport

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at four o’clock in the morning.

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were at the check-in counter,
the FSB officers

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:31.820 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
approached us

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.074 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and said that I was under investigation.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrey was interrogated

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the FSB, appeared in court,

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then spent eight months
in pretrial detention.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was prevented
from seeing his wife.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Officials tried to coerce him

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into incriminating himself.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The authorities shouted and threatened

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they could, for example, increase
the charges against me to include terrorism.

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then a difficult situation arose.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some time,
I stopped receiving letters from my wife

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I received letters from others.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then a man came

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked me:

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:11.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, what happened to your wife?
Do you know?”

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, I realized why this was happening.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told me that I could return
to my wife very soon

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I agreed to cooperate or plead guilty.

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrey acknowledges
that the presence

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of hundreds of fellow believers
who came to court to encourage him

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a great support.

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the discerning mind,

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is obvious
that law-enforcement agencies

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have crossed all boundaries
by labeling peaceful,

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
law-abiding citizens as “extremists.”

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s clear that Andrey Stupnikov
did not engage in any extremist activities.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not incite anyone
to violence or discrimination,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much less employ violent means himself.

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All he did was meet with fellow worshippers,
participate in religious services,

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share his religious views with others.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are such peaceable individuals

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:12.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being framed as criminals
and imprisoned for six years?

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many opinions on that question,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of which is that they are an easy target
for law-enforcement officers

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have quotas to meet
in their battle against extremism.

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At present, Andrey is home.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His current pretrial restrictions

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:31.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prohibit certain activities.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:36.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And although Andrey’s life has changed a lot
in the past year, he says

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:37.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that persecution will not force him

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:39.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to renounce his faith in God.

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on my life

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I dedicated myself to God,

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:49.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t change anything.

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not one person can say

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I have ruined his life
or done anything bad to him.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m proud to know Jehovah

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have him by my side.

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The judicial proceedings

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Andrey Stupnikov
are well underway,

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will likely find out very soon

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:14.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if the judge will render
a fair and independent decision

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by acquitting a person
who simply believes in God.

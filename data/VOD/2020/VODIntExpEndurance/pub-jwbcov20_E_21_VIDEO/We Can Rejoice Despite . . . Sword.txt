00:00:09 When everything falls apart
00:00:13 and when everything around you is chaotic,
00:00:17 the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.
00:00:22 My name is Baite Michael Dugbe.
00:00:25 I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in 1980.
00:00:29 Growing up in Monrovia
00:00:31 before the war was an amazing time.
00:00:35 I had wonderful parents.
00:00:37 We grew up in a nice house, and we went to a great school.
00:00:42 When I was nine years old, everything changed overnight.
00:00:46 There were reports of rebels
00:00:50 trying to take over the government.
00:00:53 Those reports alone
00:00:56 made people panic.
00:00:59 Businesses started to close down.
00:01:01 Services were shut down
00:01:04 —the lights, the power, the water— everything stopped.
00:01:09 The next few years were really unstable.
00:01:13 In 1996, things again fell apart completely.
00:01:17 It was all-out war.
00:01:19 This time, the rebels were in the city.
00:01:22 There was a lot of looting going on.
00:01:26 There was a lot of shooting.
00:01:28 The rebels—they were known for torture
00:01:31 if people would not agree to fight with them.
00:01:41 In a situation like that,
00:01:42 there’s a lot of fear; there’s a lot of panic.
00:01:46 And when your fear level rises,
00:01:49 the best way to deal with it is prayer —prayer to Jehovah,
00:01:53 asking him specifically for direction
00:01:57 on what to do next.
00:01:59 As the fighting escalated
00:02:01 and it got closer to where we lived, it was no longer safe.
00:02:04 We had to flee, and we ended up at the branch office.
00:02:08 The brothers were very loving; they took really good care of us.
00:02:14 Our spiritual activities
00:02:16 —they made sure we kept up with that.
00:02:21 Looking back, I’m very grateful to have survived.
00:02:25 Two things helped us get through.
00:02:29 Number one: our relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:32 That’s the only thing that keeps you stable.
00:02:35 But then, also, we were able to survive
00:02:37 because of the help from the brothers and sisters.
00:02:41 Those moments of trial —that’s when you really realize
00:02:45 how much you need the brotherhood.
00:02:48 I have a lot of joy in my assignment at Bethel
00:02:52 in Audio/Video Services.
00:02:54 I love the brothers and sisters that I work with.
00:02:58 It’s all thanks to Jehovah
00:03:00 that I am alive and that I get to serve him every day.

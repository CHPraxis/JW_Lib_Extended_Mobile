I was born in Caracas and live

00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:18.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an area of the city called Petare.

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:20.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Petare, I have to live

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with violence and delinquency.

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years ago,
we lost a pioneer sister who,

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:28.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sadly, was hit by a bullet.

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:32.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, something like that
also happened to my son.

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:36.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a confrontation

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:38.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the neighborhood,
and a stray bullet hit my son

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and killed him instantly.

00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:49.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That left such a void.

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:53.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It hurt me to go into his room
and see his empty bed.

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:55.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then to see his things:

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:58.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his shoes, his favorite clothes.

00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:00.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see them in the wardrobe—

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Crying was inevitable.

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:08.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These situations were very difficult 
to deal with at the time.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as the congregation

00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:16.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found out about the situation,

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:19.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right away they gave me support.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were there to help care
for all the things you need to do

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you lose a loved one.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After going through all that,
I was very afraid

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:32.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue
going out in field service.

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:34.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feared for my life

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:36.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the life of my family.

00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:39.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:43.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave me
practical wisdom to continue.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when I’m alone meditating
and thinking about my son,

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those memories return and,
of course, I have a setback,

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:58.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so to speak,

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:01.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I begin to cry again.

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:04.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keeping clearly in mind
the promise of the resurrection

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what motivates
me to keep going.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An account that I really like

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:17.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I always keep in mind
is the account about Lazarus.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:20.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, Martha uses an expression.

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:24.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says, ‘I know
he’ll rise on the last day.’

00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:27.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the same confidence
that I have in Jehovah.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that my son will rise.

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:31.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give him to me.

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:39.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time
that this terrible thing happened,

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s true that I lost my joy for a time.

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:48.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later after the mourning passes,

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:50.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resurrection hope gives us joy.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah speaks to me,
saying, ‘Keep calm.’

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:57.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if he gives me a gentle pat,

00:02:57.062 --> 00:03:00.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling me to ‘keep going
and that’s what will happen to you.

00:03:00.062 --> 00:03:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep faithful, and continue loyal,
and I will give him back to you.’

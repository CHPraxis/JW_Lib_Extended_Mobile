00:00:01 Welcome to this edition of Extraordinary Experiences.
00:00:03 We’re very happy to have with us today Laddie and Cecelia Sandy
00:00:07 serving as special pioneers in the country of Sierra Leone.
00:00:10 You attended the 144th class of Gilead.
00:00:12 Welcome, it’s very nice to have you with us.
00:00:14 Thank you.
00:00:15 On March 23, 1991,
00:00:18 the civil war in Liberia spilled across the borders
00:00:21 into Sierra Leone, and this ignited an 11-year civil war.
00:00:26 Laddie, could you tell us,
00:00:29 what were the conditions like as war came to Freetown,
00:00:32 where the branch was located?
00:00:34 It was total chaos
00:00:37 —no law and order.
00:00:40 Lawlessness was at its highest peak,
00:00:44 and it was terrible.
00:00:47 In your interview on The Inside Story,
00:00:49 you related how the branch at one point was attacked.
00:00:52 Could you explain to us, Laddie, what happened after that?
00:00:55 What did you do after that attack?
00:00:58 We had to leave the branch
00:01:02 because it was not safe.
00:01:04 People were just shouting that
00:01:06 the rebels were coming and amputating people,
00:01:09 so we decided to head
00:01:11 for another missionary home on the other side of town.
00:01:15 We just went along with the crowd,
00:01:18 and we met a military roadblock
00:01:22 that asked us not to go beyond that roadblock.
00:01:25 We had to spend the night sleeping on the streets.
00:01:28 I tried to persist,
00:01:31 and they refused and warned that if I continued asking them,
00:01:34 they would shoot at me.
00:01:37 Cecilia, what were you thinking at this time?
00:01:40 I felt like my whole body was numb out of fear.
00:01:45 And I was just praying inside—
00:01:48 I was praying for a resurrection,
00:01:50 not protection, to Jehovah
00:01:53 because all I could see in front of us was death.
00:01:56 So I would just pray that Jehovah should please
00:02:00 remember us in the resurrection.
00:02:02 And we just left everything in Jehovah’s hand.
00:02:05 Now, when the morning came,
00:02:07 what did you do in the morning?
00:02:09 We decided to return because it was quiet and a little bit safe,
00:02:13 so we returned to secure the branch.
00:02:16 To go back to the branch was a big—
00:02:20 It was a big decision for us
00:02:22 because we didn’t feel safe any longer
00:02:25 to stay either at the branch or the missionary home.
00:02:29 But we left everything in Jehovah’s hands,
00:02:32 and we did what the brothers told us:
00:02:35 “Don’t worry. Jehovah will keep protecting us.”
00:02:39 And so we went back to the branch, and we continued to stay there.
00:02:43 OK.
00:02:44 What would you say really helped the brothers and sisters
00:02:47 during this time period of war in Sierra Leone?
00:02:51 It’s love for Jehovah and the brotherhood.
00:02:54 They remained active
00:02:57 with theocratic-routine activities,
00:03:01 attending Christian meetings, having family worship,
00:03:05 getting together as a brotherhood.
00:03:09 That was what really kept them going.
00:03:10 So meeting attendance was important then, would you say, Cecelia?
00:03:14 Very much, very important.
00:03:17 Before any problem, we have to develop love for meetings
00:03:21 because if we have the habit of missing meetings,
00:03:24 it will be challenging in times of trouble.
00:03:26 What would happen if somebody who usually came to the meetings
00:03:30 didn’t come to the meeting?
00:03:33 We had to go in search of him
00:03:35 (of the family) if the family was not there,
00:03:38 because during the war,
00:03:40 we did not have access to mobile phones.
00:03:44 The telephone system was terrible,
00:03:46 so we had to take the risk
00:03:49 and make sure they were OK and return.
00:03:53 So during this time,
00:03:55 if somebody who regularly came to the meetings wasn’t there,
00:03:58 brothers would go out and risk their life
00:04:00 to find them, to make sure they were OK?
00:04:02 Yeah.
00:04:03 That’s a really powerful reminder, thank you.
00:04:06 Laddie, did you have anything else you’d like to add or to share with us?
00:04:11 Well, in times of difficulties, we need to pray
00:04:15 to Jehovah for courage
00:04:17 to face challenges in life
00:04:20 because Jehovah, indeed, will help us.
00:04:23 And the collective prayers
00:04:26 on our behalf from the brotherhood
00:04:29 —Jehovah does listen to such prayers.
00:04:31 That’s what, really, I learned personally during the war period in Sierra Leone.
00:04:37 I don’t know where the courage came from.
00:04:39 Because it’s later on that Jehovah gives the courage,
00:04:43 and the collective prayers of our brothers also help.
00:04:46 Thank you very much. We thank both of you very much,
00:04:49 and we thank you, too, friends, for being with us,
00:04:51 and we look forward to being together again for another edition
00:04:53 of Extraordinary Experiences.

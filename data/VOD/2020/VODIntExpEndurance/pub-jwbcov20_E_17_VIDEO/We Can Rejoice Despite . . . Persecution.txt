00:00:08 Early one morning, armed Russian special forces
00:00:11 broke into my home.
00:00:17 They handcuffed me and searched my place.
00:00:23 They took me
00:00:24 to the FSB office for interrogation.
00:00:26 Two days later, the court sentenced me to pretrial detention.
00:00:35 I was scared because I didn’t know
00:00:37 how I would be treated in prison.
00:00:40 Threatening that things would get worse for me, the officer demanded
00:00:43 that I incriminate myself, admit guilt, and give the names of my fellow believers.
00:00:48 I also really missed my dear wife.
00:00:51 It was so hard without her.
00:00:54 For two months, I didn’t have
00:00:56 any spiritual food or a Bible,
00:00:59 so I decided to make one.
00:01:00 My wife sent me a notebook,
00:01:03 and every day I wrote down verses
00:01:05 that I was able to remember.
00:01:07 After I had written about 500 verses,
00:01:10 I was given a Bible.
00:01:12 Because I was
00:01:13 so spiritually hungry, I read it through in four months.
00:01:17 During this time, I wrote letters
00:01:19 to my wife and friends and shared interesting things
00:01:22 that I learned from my reading.
00:01:23 But the letters I received
00:01:25 from my friends and my dear wife gave me the feeling
00:01:29 that the brothers and sisters were so close to me,
00:01:33 as if they were in the cells next to me.
00:01:35 I wasn’t lonely.
00:01:37 I felt as if my friends were right there with me.
00:01:42 Pretrial detention isolates a person from society.
00:01:46 But it’s impossible to isolate someone from Jehovah.
00:01:49 Throughout the day, I prayed to Jehovah many times,
00:01:52 but I especially waited for bedtime.
00:01:55 When everyone was in bed and only the night-light was on,
00:01:58 I could talk to Jehovah as much as I wanted.
00:02:02 There were times when I was all alone
00:02:04 in the cell and, of course, I took advantage of the situation.
00:02:09 I would get down on my knees and would literally cry
00:02:13 as I prayed to Jehovah.
00:02:16 I decided to write my requests to God
00:02:19 on a sheet of paper and then mark off the ones that he answered.
00:02:23 I was convinced that Jehovah was very close to me.
00:02:27 I also quietly sang our songs
00:02:30 throughout the day.
00:02:31 But when I was all alone, I sang at the top of my voice.
00:02:35 I also tried to give a witness whenever possible.
00:02:39 We discussed a variety of topics
00:02:41 —everything from tattoos to “the king of the north.”
00:02:45 All my fears and anxieties were for nothing.
00:02:49 I was in detention 343 days,
00:02:53 and “not even a hair” fell from my head.
00:02:56 This was the most interesting year of my life
00:03:00 —an excellent school to help refine my spiritual qualities.
00:03:03 I have never felt so close to Jehovah.
00:03:06 What a great honor to uphold God’s sovereignty in this way!

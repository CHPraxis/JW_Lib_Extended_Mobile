00:00:01 Big projects require thousands of volunteers
00:00:05 over a period of several years.
00:00:08 On our program thus far, we have also considered disaster relief work
00:00:12 and branch renovation projects.
00:00:15 All of these initiatives require
00:00:17 that volunteers fill out an application
00:00:21 to be used in these capacities.
00:00:24 And there are so many avenues of service
00:00:27 that require the submittal of an application.
00:00:30 With that thought in mind,
00:00:32 please carefully watch the next video entitled
00:00:35 A New Application for Processing Applications.
00:00:46 Have you ever submitted an application to expand your ministry?
00:00:53 Since the early 1900’s,
00:00:55 our organization has used paper applications
00:00:57 for many forms of service
00:01:03 and faithful workers have responded.
00:01:07 This growth is in fulfillment of Jesus’ words at Matthew 9:37:
00:01:12 “The harvest is great.”
00:01:17 And the needs are greater than ever before.
00:01:21 Can more workers make themselves available?
00:01:26 Can applying for different avenues of service be simplified?
00:01:31 We are pleased to announce
00:01:33 online applications on jw.org®!
00:01:38 Publishers will be able to apply online to expand their ministry!
00:01:46 Elders will review and approve applications online.
00:01:51 When needed, circuit overseers will review
00:01:54 and approve applications online.
00:01:57 Your willing spirit to expand your theocratic service
00:02:01 supports the need for more workers in many ways.
00:02:11 Jehovah inspired King David to write:
00:02:14 “Your people will offer themselves willingly.”
00:02:19 And Jehovah’s people have always wholeheartedly responded.
00:02:26 We hope this new online tool
00:02:28 will help you support the Kingdom
00:02:31 in whatever way you can, all to Jehovah’s praise.
00:02:49 As you noted, this provision will be available
00:02:51 for those applying for various privileges of service
00:02:55 beginning January 2020.
00:03:00 Technology continues to make advancements.
00:03:04 Is there a way to harness such advances
00:03:07 for the benefit of Jehovah’s people?
00:03:10 Brother Clive Martin,
00:03:12 who oversees the MEPS Department at Warwick,
00:03:16 will discuss a new way
00:03:18 to access jw.org® audio files.
00:03:22 Please, Brother Martin.
00:03:26 We just love the rich supply of spiritual food on our website and app.
00:03:31 However, some have asked if there’s an easier way to find
00:03:35 and listen to the audio publications and programs.
00:03:39 This would be particularly helpful
00:03:42 for many of our dear publishers who have limited vision
00:03:45 and who depend on these audio programs.
00:03:49 With this in mind, we’re happy to introduce
00:03:52 jw.org® for Amazon Alexa
00:03:55 and the Google Voice Assistant.
00:04:01 You may have bought
00:04:03 one of these voice assistants
00:04:04 to listen to music,
00:04:06 check the news and the weather,
00:04:08 or perhaps to control your home appliances.
00:04:11 Now you can use it to listen
00:04:13 to the content that we need
00:04:14 for our regular spiritual routine.
00:04:17 Let’s try it out.
00:04:19 “Alexa, read the daily text from jw.org.”
00:04:25 Reading the daily text.
00:04:27 Saturday, October 5:
00:04:29 “Make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them.”
00:04:35 “Alexa, play the Bible reading for this week from jw.org.”
00:04:41 Playing this week’s Bible reading.
00:04:43 The letter of James.
00:04:46 Chapter 1.
00:04:49 For Google devices, the command is just a little different.
00:04:53 Let’s ask for a specific chapter.
00:04:55 “Hey, Google,
00:04:57 ask jw.org to play Matthew 24.”
00:05:01 Playing the Bible starting at Matthew chapter 24.
00:05:05 Chapter 24:
00:05:08 “Now as Jesus was departing from . . . ”
00:05:12 Are you learning another language?
00:05:14 Here’s a feature that can help.
00:05:16 “Alexa,
00:05:18 play the Watchtower  study in Russian from jw.org.”
00:05:22 Playing this week’s Watchtower  study article in Russian.
00:05:30 Just remember, though,
00:05:32 that your newfound friend does have some limitations.
00:05:37 “Alexa, what do you think of that new point in The Watchtower?”
00:05:41 I don’t have an opinion on that.
00:05:51 And that’s probably just as well.
00:05:57 Would you like to listen to the audio track of the monthly broadcast?
00:06:01 “Hey, Google, ask jw.org to play the broadcast.”
00:06:08 Playing JW Broadcasting®, September 2019.
00:06:12 Hello, everyone.
00:06:14 We’re so happy to have you with us for this month’s broadcast.
00:06:17 You can also ask for the broadcast for a specific month or year.
00:06:21 Now, how about some theocratic music?
00:06:24 “Alexa, play original songs from jw.org.”
00:06:30 Playing original songs.
00:06:39 You can also listen to our collection of Kingdom songs in the same way.
00:06:44 Or if you want to practice a specific song for the meeting,
00:06:48 “Hey, Google, ask jw.org to play song 57.”
00:06:54 Playing 57, “Preaching to All Sorts of People.”
00:07:04 These features will be available within the next few days.
00:07:15 So look on jw.org this coming week for instructions
00:07:19 on how to enable these features for your Alexa or Google device.
00:07:24 We thank Jehovah and his organization
00:07:28 that they make it ever easier for us to benefit
00:07:31 from our rich library of spiritual content.
00:07:43 We now look forward to Scriptural talks to be presented
00:07:50 by various members of the Governing Body.
00:07:53 First, please give your attention to Brother David Splane.
00:07:57 His subject is intriguing:
00:07:59 “An Attack Coming From the North.”
00:08:12 Alexa!
00:08:25 Where are you when I need you?
00:08:35 Well, an attack coming from the north—
00:08:41 What are we talking about?
00:08:43 Are we talking about the attack of Gog of Magog?
00:08:47 No.
00:08:49 We’re talking about an attack
00:08:52 by a plague of locusts
00:08:57 coming from the north.
00:08:59 And we can read   about that plague in Joel chapter 2.
00:09:04 I’d like you to follow  and leave your Bibles open, please,
00:09:08 at Joel because we’re going to be considering
00:09:10 a few verses in this prophecy.
00:09:13 This is Joel 2:7-9
00:09:19 —an attack by a plague,
00:09:23 a swarm, of locusts.
00:09:25 Joel 2:7:
00:09:27 “They charge like warriors,
00:09:31 “they scale a wall like soldiers,
00:09:33 “each keeps to his own course,
00:09:36 “and they do not swerve from their paths.
00:09:39 “They do not shove one another;
00:09:41 “each man advances in his course.
00:09:44 “If the weapons cause some to fall, the others do not break ranks.
00:09:48 “Into the city they rush, on the wall they run.
00:09:51 “Onto the houses they climb,
00:09:53 through the windows they enter like a thief.”
00:09:59 Now, I think you can see that we’re not talking about insects here.
00:10:03 Notice in verse 8:
00:10:05 “Each man  advances in his course.”
00:10:08 So we’re talking about people
00:10:11 who are likened to locusts,
00:10:14 who have the characteristics of locusts.
00:10:17 And the question is,
00:10:19 Are these good people, or are they bad people?
00:10:25 Well, for many years,
00:10:27 including in the April 15, 2009, Watchtower,
00:10:31 our understanding was that these were good people.
00:10:35 In fact, these were Jehovah’s people.
00:10:37 These were Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:10:39 who were preaching the good news of the Kingdom.
00:10:42 And the idea was that they were just like locusts because,
00:10:45 first of all, you couldn’t stop them from preaching
00:10:48 and they would go to any length to keep preaching the good news
00:10:52 —probably not go into people’s windows like thieves,
00:10:56 but otherwise, they’d stop short of that.
00:10:59 But they would do other things.
00:11:00 Preaching the good news
00:11:02 —it didn’t matter what wall of opposition was erected against them;
00:11:05 they would scale that wall and keep preaching.
00:11:09 And if we were to confine ourselves to a reading of just these three verses,
00:11:14 we could make a case for that explanation.
00:11:18 But now, prophecy is best understood
00:11:21 when we consider it in context.
00:11:24 And if you look at the context of Joel chapter 2,
00:11:28 you are forced to come to a different conclusion.
00:11:32 Now let’s consider a couple of reasons why this is so.
00:11:36 Now, we talk about context,
00:11:38 so let’s look at verse 20 in the same chapter,
00:11:42 Joel chapter 2.
00:11:45 And here in verse 20,
00:11:47 we’re talking about the locusts that come from the north,
00:11:51 and we’re going to see how Jehovah views these locusts.
00:11:55 Are these good people, or are they bad people?
00:11:58 Verse 20:
00:12:00 “I will drive the northerner far away from you;
00:12:04 “I will disperse him to a dry and desolate wasteland,
00:12:08 with his vanguard toward the eastern sea.”
00:12:12 Well, Jehovah is talking about the locusts here,
00:12:16 and he says he’s going to drive them away.
00:12:18 If these were Kingdom publishers who are declaring the good news,
00:12:22 why would Jehovah want to drive them away?
00:12:24 And then how does Jehovah view these locusts?
00:12:27 Look at the last part of verse 20:
00:12:31 “The foul smell from him will ascend,
00:12:34 the stench from him will keep ascending.”
00:12:38 That’s not good.
00:12:41 So it’s looking like these locusts are not good people.
00:12:46 What is Jehovah talking about here?
00:12:49 Pest control.
00:12:52 He doesn’t like the locusts.
00:12:55 Now look at verse 25.
00:12:57 Jehovah says:
00:12:59 “And I will make compensation to you for the years
00:13:04 “that the swarming locust, the unwinged locust,
00:13:07 “the voracious locust, and the devouring locust have eaten,
00:13:11 my great army that I sent among you.”
00:13:15 Well, now, if the locusts were ministers of the Kingdom,
00:13:19 why would Jehovah say that he had to “make compensation”
00:13:22 for the damage that the locusts have done?
00:13:24 The locusts, if they were Kingdom publishers,
00:13:27 would just be helping people to save their lives.
00:13:29 So why would Jehovah call that damage?
00:13:32 Why would he say they would have to “make compensation”?
00:13:36 Now, that’s one aspect of this that we considered.
00:13:41 But there’s another one, and that is the sequence of events.
00:13:44 Look at verse 28,
00:13:47 and we’ll read just the first part of verse 28.
00:13:50 And keep in mind, at this point,
00:13:52 Jehovah has driven the locusts away.
00:13:55 They have done all the damage they could.
00:13:58 They have devastated the land.
00:14:00 They have destroyed all of the vegetation,
00:14:03 and now Jehovah God has driven
00:14:05 “the northerner,” the locust, away.
00:14:08 And so, what does he say in verse 28?
00:14:11 “After that
00:14:14 “[after the locusts have been driven away]
00:14:18 I will pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh.”
00:14:23 Now let’s think about that.
00:14:25 If the locusts were really carrying out the preaching work
00:14:29 and they don’t get the holy spirit until after they finish the preaching work,
00:14:33 does that mean that we’ve been preaching all this time
00:14:36 without the help of Jehovah’s powerful holy spirit?
00:14:39 I’m sure you’ll all agree, we couldn’t possibly keep preaching
00:14:42 without the help of Jehovah’s powerful holy spirit.
00:14:48 So it’s obvious that we have some thinking to do about this prophecy.
00:14:53 Now, someone might bring up Revelation chapter 9,
00:14:57 because in Revelation chapter 9,
00:14:59 we read of locusts with “human faces”
00:15:02 and what “seemed to be crowns of gold” on their heads,
00:15:06 and they torment the wicked.
00:15:08 And someone will say,
00:15:10 “Well, don’t those locusts represent
00:15:13 Jehovah’s anointed servants and their preaching work?”
00:15:16 And the answer is yes.
00:15:18 And it’s true that there are some similarities
00:15:21 between Revelation chapter 9 and Joel chapter 2,
00:15:24 but there are significant differences as well.
00:15:27 For example, in Joel’s prophecy,
00:15:29 the locusts come from the north,
00:15:32 they devastate the vegetation, and they’re driven away.
00:15:35 But what about Revelation?
00:15:37 Well, those locusts come out of an abyss,
00:15:40 and “they [are] told not to harm the vegetation,”
00:15:44 and they stay on until their work is done.
00:15:47 So there are similarities, but there are also differences.
00:15:51 What are we saying?
00:15:53 We are saying that the locusts in Revelation
00:15:57 are not the same as the locusts in Joel.
00:16:01 Now, it’s not unusual for a symbol to mean one thing in one Bible book
00:16:04 and something quite different in another
00:16:07 —Revelation 5:5, Jesus, “the Lion of the tribe of Judah”;
00:16:12 1 Peter 5:8, Satan the Devil, “a roaring lion”
00:16:17 —same symbol but quite different meanings.
00:16:22 Well, now,
00:16:24 if the locusts are bad people,
00:16:28 if they are not Jehovah’s faithful servants,
00:16:32 we have to look for a different explanation.
00:16:35 What could it be?
00:16:38 It’s a simple one.
00:16:41 Joel is predicting a military attack.
00:16:46 Jehovah will use Babylonian soldiers who are just like locusts
00:16:51 —“my great army,” he calls them—
00:16:53 to bring his people into captivity.
00:16:56 And the army is called “the northerner”
00:16:58 because the Babylonians will come up and invade Israel from the north.
00:17:03 And when we read Joel 2:8, 9
00:17:05 with the idea of Babylonian soldiers, it all makes sense.
00:17:09 Let’s just read those verses again, verse 8 and verse 9:
00:17:14 “They do not shove one another;
00:17:17 “each man advances in his course.
00:17:19 “If the weapons cause some to fall, the others do not break ranks.
00:17:24 “Into the city they rush,  on the wall they run.
00:17:28 Onto the houses they climb, through the windows they enter like a thief.”
00:17:32 Can you picture the scene?
00:17:34 There are soldiers everywhere.
00:17:36 No one can escape the sword of the Babylonians.
00:17:41 And this concords with what the prophet Isaiah wrote.
00:17:44 He was looking into the future,
00:17:47 and he was looking at this event and the outcome of this event.
00:17:51 And he says: “All who were found were taken prisoner,
00:17:55 even though they had fled far away.”
00:18:01 Now, the prophet Jeremiah foretold something similar
00:18:04 at Jeremiah 16:16.
00:18:08 Let’s read that; then we’ll go back to Joel.
00:18:13 Jeremiah 16:16:
00:18:23 “‘Here I am sending for many fishermen,’
00:18:25 “declares Jehovah, ‘and they will fish for them.
00:18:29 “‘After that I will send for many hunters,
00:18:32 “‘and they will hunt them down
00:18:35 “‘on every mountain and every hill
00:18:38 and out of the clefts of the crags.’”
00:18:41 Now, we used to think that the hunters and fishers
00:18:45 were hunting and fishing for righthearted ones
00:18:48 in sort of a marking work, I guess,
00:18:50 where they were looking for righthearted ones.
00:18:52 But now, the revised New World Translation
00:18:55 helps us to get the right understanding of this.
00:18:57 Did you notice what it says?
00:18:58 “They will hunt them down.”
00:19:01 It’s the wicked who are being hunted, not the righthearted ones.
00:19:06 And just to confirm that, look at verse 17:
00:19:09 “For my eyes are on everything they do.
00:19:12 “They have not been hidden from before me,
00:19:14 nor has their error been hidden from my eyes.”
00:19:17 And then in verse 18, he says he is going
00:19:19 to ‘repay the full amount of their error.’
00:19:23 So these are not righthearted ones.
00:19:25 These are people who might try to hide in the forest.
00:19:29 They’ll be hunted down.
00:19:30 If they go out and try to hide in the sea, they’ll be fished out of the water.
00:19:35 They will not get away from the Babylonian soldiers.
00:19:40 But now Joel has some good news for us,
00:19:43 and we want some good news after this, don’t we?
00:19:46 And the news is restoration.
00:19:49 And Joel is saying that at some point an ample supply of spiritual food
00:19:54 is going to become available for the people.
00:19:56 Let’s go back to Joel
00:19:58 and this time read entirely verses 28 and 29.
00:20:02 Joel 2 —Joel 2:28, 29:
00:20:09 “After that
00:20:11 “[so the Babylonians have done what they were going to do]
00:20:15 “I will pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh,
00:20:20 “and your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
00:20:23 “your old men will dream dreams, and your young men will see visions.
00:20:26 “And even on my male slaves and female slaves
00:20:30 I will pour out my spirit in those days.”
00:20:35 Well, when was the prophecy fulfilled?
00:20:37 After that, certainly.
00:20:39 The apostle Peter tells us
00:20:41 that it was first fulfilled at Pentecost 33 C.E.
00:20:45 Jehovah poured out his spirit, and at the end of that day,
00:20:49 there were 3,000 publishers of the Kingdom.
00:20:54 And did Jehovah bless their zealous activity?
00:20:59 He certainly did, because by the end of the century,
00:21:04 thousands had become obedient to the word.
00:21:10 How many thousands?
00:21:12 We don’t know.
00:21:14 The Bible doesn’t say.
00:21:16 But we do know that it would have to be
00:21:19 a lot less than 144,000
00:21:22 because the search for Kingdom heirs was going on in the first century,
00:21:25 and it wasn’t nearly complete by the end of the first century.
00:21:28 Yet, the zealous activity of those 3,000
00:21:32 who began preaching the good news,
00:21:35 that zealous activity, was blessed by Jehovah God,
00:21:39 and thousands became obedient to the word.
00:21:44 Well, now, can we see a little bit of a parallel here?
00:21:49 The year 1919.
00:21:51 In 1919, according to official records,
00:21:55 there were fewer than 6,000 publishers
00:21:58 of the good news.
00:22:01 But has Jehovah blessed the efforts
00:22:04 of those 6,000 publishers?
00:22:06 By the end of the century,
00:22:09 he certainly had shown that he’d blessed the efforts of the brothers.
00:22:13 Do you know that every year
00:22:16 since 1983,
00:22:19 more than 144,000
00:22:22 have been baptized each year?
00:22:25 And our brothers today don’t have the gifts of the spirit.
00:22:28 So, what does this indicate?
00:22:30 It indicates that Jehovah has made
00:22:33 a mighty outpouring of his spirit
00:22:36 in these last days.
00:22:38 It’s a marvelous thing to behold.
00:22:41 Now, when you think of it,
00:22:43 we sort of had our explanation backward in the past.
00:22:46 Because in the past, the idea was that the spirit
00:22:49 was poured out in 1919 and then the locusts went to work,
00:22:52 because the locusts were Jehovah’s people.
00:22:54 But that’s not what the Bible says, is it?
00:22:56 The Bible says that the locusts finish their work,
00:22:59 and after that, the spirit is poured out.
00:23:02 Well, today, thousands upon thousands are getting baptized,
00:23:07 and we can expect that more are going to get baptized in the future,
00:23:10 with the new instructions we’ve received:
00:23:12 Concentrate more on conversations;
00:23:15 concentrate more on starting Bible studies.
00:23:17 And with those instructions in mind,
00:23:19 no doubt we’re going to have a tremendous increase in baptisms.
00:23:24 But now, here’s a little word of caution:
00:23:26 By all means, have conversations;
00:23:30 by all means, read the Bible to people;
00:23:34 by all means, offer Bible studies.
00:23:38 But don’t forget to offer literature.
00:23:43 If you say,
00:23:45 “I deliberately didn’t offer one piece of literature all month,”
00:23:49 you’re not bragging.
00:23:52 What do we print it for?
00:23:55 And, brothers, let’s be realistic about it:
00:23:57 You have a lovely conversation with someone,
00:24:00 and then you don’t find the person for another three weeks.
00:24:03 Leave the person some literature
00:24:05 that he can read so that he can further his interest.
00:24:10 Well, we might think of this explanation and say:
00:24:15 “Well, that’s obvious. This explanation is obvious.
00:24:19 Why didn’t we see it before?”
00:24:22 And the answer is, yes, it’s obvious
00:24:25 when Jehovah’s time for us to understand it comes along.
00:24:30 But before Jehovah’s time for us to understand it comes along,
00:24:33 it isn’t always so obvious.
00:24:36 So we always look to Jehovah God for clarification in matters.
00:24:40 Now, what has changed?
00:24:42 It’s true that in a few lands (but not many)
00:24:46 Jehovah’s people do seem to be everywhere,
00:24:49 as numerous as locusts,
00:24:51 and it’s true that in every land we won’t allow
00:24:54 any wall of opposition to prevent us from doing our work;
00:24:58 but we’re just not doing it
00:25:00 in fulfillment of Joel chapter 2 and Jeremiah chapter 16.
00:25:04 So let’s continue having a zealous share
00:25:07 in proclaiming the life-giving message that God has given us,
00:25:11 confident that he won’t drive us away.
00:25:14 He will sustain us until the work is done.
00:25:26 Well, it was certainly very encouraging and interesting.
00:25:29 Thank you, Brother Splane.
00:25:31 Now Brother Herd has something to share with us.
00:25:35 His title is “Study the Bible With the Study Bible.”
00:25:44 Who is the most important person that you know?
00:25:47 Well, as dedicated Witnesses of Jehovah, I’m sure you would say, “Jehovah.”
00:25:52 Well, who is the second most important person that you know?
00:25:59 I asked my wife that once, and she said, “You.”
00:26:03 And then she said, “I’m just joking.”
00:26:08 No, it’s Jesus Christ, and we all know that.
00:26:12 But, now, how important is it for us to know
00:26:15 not just Jehovah but also his Son?
00:26:20 Well, let’s look at something in the Bible.
00:26:22 Open your Bibles, if you please,
00:26:24 to John 17:3,
00:26:28 one of the most familiar scriptures that we learn when we come into the truth,
00:26:33 John 17:3:
00:26:36 “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you,
00:26:39 the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”
00:26:45 Well, now, let’s think about it.
00:26:47 It means our salvation —doesn’t it?—
00:26:49 to come to know Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus.
00:26:54 Come to know them —it means everlasting life.
00:26:59 Our salvation rests on our knowledge
00:27:03 of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus.
00:27:06 It means our life.
00:27:10 But “coming to know,” what does this mean?
00:27:16 Could it be what the study note on this verse says?
00:27:22 “The verb is used in the present tense to express continuous action.”
00:27:27 Absolutely! That’s the correct answer.
00:27:30 So coming to know Jehovah
00:27:34 or someone else is an ongoing process.
00:27:41 We have to become acquainted with that person.
00:27:47 Now, if I should ask you, How many of you know me?
00:27:51 Raise your hands, please.
00:27:53 Get them down because you don’t really know me.
00:27:57 Oh, in a sense, you were right in raising your hand.
00:28:00 You know who I am; you know the position I have.
00:28:02 You’ve got my name, you’ve heard me give some talks, and so forth.
00:28:06 So you have some knowledge of me, but there are so many things
00:28:10 about me that you don’t know.
00:28:13 And if you did know these things,
00:28:18 it wouldn’t help you.
00:28:22 But, now, coming to know Jehovah is altogether different.
00:28:24 Coming to know Jesus is altogether different.
00:28:28 The more we know about them, why, then
00:28:31 the better we have a relationship with them.
00:28:35 And we’re going to benefit from that knowledge in ever so many ways.
00:28:40 So we want to come to know Jehovah.
00:28:44 No matter how long we’ve been in the truth
00:28:46 (and some of you have been there for decades),
00:28:49 we must keep working at coming to know Jehovah God
00:28:54 and his Son, Jesus.
00:28:57 But the question is,
00:28:58 How can we come to know Jehovah better and better?
00:29:05 Well, we can learn much through creation.
00:29:08 We look around us, and it draws us ever closer to Jehovah.
00:29:13 When we see the animal creation, as we have earlier today
00:29:18 (the zebra and various birds and other animals),
00:29:23 we think of Jehovah and his great wisdom
00:29:26 and the blessings that he has showered upon us
00:29:30 as a result of the creation around us.
00:29:32 And how many of us enjoy going to the beautiful parks a certain time of year
00:29:37 and enjoying all the creation —the greenery, the flowers, the trees?
00:29:41 My, there’s just no end to it!
00:29:43 And whenever we see fish that we’ve never seen before
00:29:46 (and there are so many fish that are so new to us),
00:29:49 their beauty—
00:29:51 It all speaks of Jehovah as the Creator, does it not?
00:29:55 And we marvel at these wonderful things.
00:29:58 But here’s another way that we benefit:
00:30:03 It’s through his Word.
00:30:05 It’s through the Bible that we’re able
00:30:08 to know the name of our God—Jehovah.
00:30:15 We’re able to appreciate what that name stands for,
00:30:21 and we’re drawn ever closer
00:30:23 to him as a result of that knowledge.
00:30:26 We’re able to have the knowledge of his purpose.
00:30:30 We know that he’s not responsible
00:30:32 for all the wickedness that goes on in the earth around us.
00:30:35 That’s not of his making, but yet people in the world feel that it is.
00:30:39 If someone dies, they blame God: “Why did he take that beautiful little girl?
00:30:43 “She was only two years old.
00:30:44 Why did he do a thing like that?”
00:30:46 Well, they have no knowledge, but you have knowledge.
00:30:50 When a person dies whom they love,
00:30:53 people in the world have no idea
00:30:57 about the resurrection.
00:30:59 They feel that two things can happen.
00:31:01 Many of them feel this way (not all),
00:31:03 that two things can happen —either they go to heaven
00:31:06 and become a flower in His garden up there in some kind of a way
00:31:11 or else they go somewhere else
00:31:14 where they are tormented
00:31:17 day and night forever and ever.
00:31:22 Now, what about God’s Son?
00:31:24 How can we come to know him better and better.
00:31:27 Well, let’s watch the following video,
00:31:29 How Can We Come to Know the Son of God Better and Better?,
00:31:33 seven minutes.
00:31:41 He was neither rich nor powerful from the world’s point of view.
00:31:47 He did not even have a home that he could call his own.
00:31:51 Yet, his teachings have changed the course of history.
00:31:55 They have helped millions to gain
00:31:58 something more important than material wealth.
00:32:02 The man is Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
00:32:09 Jehovah wants us to know his Son,
00:32:11 to love his Son, to be like his Son.
00:32:17 To help us know his Son, Jehovah lovingly reserved
00:32:20 a portion of his Word, the four Gospels
00:32:23 —Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John— and the book of Acts.
00:32:27 These Bible books have helped true Christians to find
00:32:31 the happiest, most meaningful life possible.
00:32:39 The Gospels portray a man of tender and deep feelings.
00:32:43 They show the wide range of Jesus’ personality:
00:32:47 compassion for a leper,
00:32:51 indignation at self-righteous religious leaders,
00:32:56 deep sadness over the nation that rejected him.
00:33:01 In the Gospels,
00:33:03 we learn of the many miracles Jesus performed,
00:33:07 from healing the sick to raising the dead.
00:33:10 Those miracles changed people’s lives,
00:33:13 yet Jesus was not known as Healer or a miracle worker.
00:33:17 Instead, he was called the Teacher.
00:33:20 And what a teacher he was!
00:33:24 Think of the wise sayings of Jesus that have become
00:33:27 part of everyday speech
00:33:30 thousands of years after he uttered them.
00:33:34 The Gospels give a fourfold historical account
00:33:37 of the life and ministry of Jesus.
00:33:41 Matthew, an apostle, evidently wrote
00:33:45 his Gospel for the Jews.
00:33:48 Over 40 percent of its content is unique.
00:33:54 Matthew gives us a far more extensive account of the Sermon on the Mount.
00:33:58 In this profound sermon,
00:34:01 Jesus does not just tell us the course of wisdom.
00:34:04 He does much more.
00:34:06 He shows us by explaining, reasoning, and offering proof.
00:34:13 How we marvel at the simplicity, clarity,
00:34:17 and unparalleled wisdom in the teachings of Jesus!
00:34:23 Mark’s vigorous, fast-moving account
00:34:25 was seemingly written for non-Jewish readers.
00:34:29 It mentions 19 miracles of Jesus,
00:34:33 including the only account of the deaf man whose hearing Jesus restored.
00:34:39 Considerately, Jesus takes the man away from the crowd
00:34:44 and heals him in a private place.
00:34:48 How reassuring to learn that Jesus uses his power
00:34:51 in such a considerate and thoughtful way!
00:34:57 Luke, the beloved physician,
00:35:00 wrote for both Jews and non-Jews.
00:35:05 Some 60 percent of this Gospel is unique,
00:35:08 including the account of the resurrection
00:35:11 of the only child of the widow of Nain.
00:35:15 Jesus is “moved with pity” for this widow.
00:35:18 After resurrecting her son,
00:35:20 Jesus gives him to his mother.
00:35:23 Death has torn the family apart,
00:35:26 but Jesus makes them a family again.
00:35:30 How beautifully this account reveals a very tender side of the Son of God!
00:35:37 John, the apostle who was especially close to Jesus,
00:35:42 wrote his Gospel last.
00:35:44 Some 90 percent contains information
00:35:47 not found in the other three Gospels.
00:35:52 Only John mentions the resurrection of Lazarus.
00:35:55 In this touching account,
00:35:57 Jesus openly sheds tears.
00:36:01 How comforting it is to know that Jesus
00:36:03 has such deep empathy!
00:36:08 Together, the four Gospels paint a detailed portrait of Jesus.
00:36:12 The Bible book of Acts
00:36:14 also helps us to come to know Jesus.
00:36:17 Written by the physician Luke, Acts is a continuation
00:36:20 of the Gospel of Luke.
00:36:23 In the opening chapter, we learn of Jesus’ final words
00:36:26 to his disciples before ascending to heaven.
00:36:30 The resurrected Jesus leaves no doubt as to what he expects his disciples,
00:36:35 including us, to do.
00:36:37 They are to be witnesses of him
00:36:40 “to the most distant part of the earth.”
00:36:44 The Bible book of Acts helps us to understand
00:36:47 what being a follower of Jesus is all about.
00:36:53 How can we benefit fully from the four Gospels and the book of Acts?
00:36:58 We must do more than just read them.
00:37:01 We must slow down and take the time
00:37:04 to study them carefully and meditate on them deeply.
00:37:10 We need to bring the accounts to life by doing research,
00:37:13 observing details,
00:37:15 comparing parallel accounts,
00:37:18 and using our imagination
00:37:21 to see, hear, and feel the action.
00:37:27 Over the years, our organization has published a number of books
00:37:30 designed to help us to dig deeply.
00:37:34 At the annual meeting in 2015,
00:37:37 the Governing Body announced
00:37:39 that a new online Study Bible  would be released.
00:37:44 How can the Study Bible help us come to know Jesus better?
00:37:50 Within the four Gospels alone, there are about 2,300 study notes.
00:37:56 Added to that, the image gallery, maps, and introduction videos
00:38:01 bring the Bible accounts to life.
00:38:06 There’s no question about it.
00:38:08 Our organization has given us the help we need
00:38:10 to dig deeper into the Gospels and the book of Acts
00:38:14 and to reflect appreciatively on them.
00:38:20 As a result, we come to know the Son of God better and better.
00:38:27 We agree with the sentiment of the apostle Peter,
00:38:30 who said of Jesus:
00:38:32 “Though you never saw him, you love him.”
00:38:44 Have you benefited from using the online Study Bible?
00:38:53 I’m sure you will agree that it is a great tool to help us
00:38:58 come to know God’s Son better and better.
00:39:01 But what if accessing the information online
00:39:05 is not easy for you as an individual?
00:39:08 Let’s face it, not everyone has easy access
00:39:13 to the Internet or finds it easy to navigate online.
00:39:18 Well, the Governing Body
00:39:20 is pleased to announce the release of a printed version
00:39:24 of the Study Bible
00:39:26 containing the five Bible books we just discussed in the video
00:39:30 —Matthew through Acts.
00:39:43 Why are we releasing a printed version of the Study Bible?
00:39:46 Well, many prefer a printed medium such as a book,
00:39:50 especially for doing deeper reading and making notes.
00:39:55 It’s easier to slow down
00:39:57 and absorb the information at hand.
00:40:01 And many of us find it easier when we use a printed and bound book
00:40:06 for our study periods.
00:40:08 Have you ever gone back and found something you read in a book
00:40:11 because you recall that it was either at the top
00:40:16 or bottom of a page
00:40:18 or on the left- or on the right-hand side of a two-page spread?
00:40:24 Would you like to see what this new publication looks like?
00:40:31 Well, let’s watch the next video.
00:40:57 What are some of the features of the printed Study Bible
00:41:01 that make it an effective tool for studying the four Gospels and the book of Acts?
00:41:07 Let’s see.
00:41:13 Each Bible book has an introduction with noteworthy facts,
00:41:16 study notes about the title,
00:41:18 and an overview of the book.
00:41:21 Subheadings within the sacred text help you
00:41:23 to locate specific accounts more easily.
00:41:28 Wide margins offer ample space for note-taking.
00:41:31 Study notes are found below the scriptures.
00:41:35 The image gallery contains 153 illustrations and photographs
00:41:40 from the books of Matthew through Acts.
00:41:44 The map gallery helps you to combine
00:41:46 specific events with locations.
00:41:49 The glossary gives definitions of Biblical and non-Biblical words
00:41:54 that are used in the main text or in the study notes.
00:41:59 Would you like to read the entire Bible in one year?
00:42:03 Then use the Bible reading schedule to keep track of your progress.
00:42:09 This Study Bible  is designed to help you study more deeply
00:42:12 and bring Bible accounts to life.
00:42:15 Take, for instance, the account of the widow in the temple.
00:42:20 Verse 41 says that
00:42:22 Jesus “sat down
00:42:25 with the treasury chests in view.”
00:42:30 Hmm.
00:42:32 What does the study note say about treasury chests?
00:42:37 That’s interesting: ‘According to rabbinical sources,
00:42:41 there were 13 treasury chests’ for collecting
00:42:44 the contributions of those entering the temple.
00:42:47 And these chests were “apparently located in the area
00:42:50 called the Court of the Women.”
00:42:53 I wonder where that was in the temple.
00:42:55 Hmm.
00:42:57 The study note directs us to Appendix B11.
00:43:02 Wow, look at those four giant golden lampstands!
00:43:08 ‘The facade surrounding the front doors
00:43:11 may have been plated with gold.’
00:43:14 Impressive!
00:43:17 The “light from the rising sun
00:43:19 would have been reflected with dazzling brilliance.”
00:43:23 Let me go back to the account.
00:43:26 Verse 42 says: “Now a poor widow came
00:43:31 and dropped in two small coins of very little value.”
00:43:35 What does the parallel account say?
00:43:38 Luke’s account calls her “a needy widow.”
00:43:42 The study note says:
00:43:45 “Needy . . . may denote a person
00:43:48 “who lacks the basic necessities of life
00:43:51 or someone for whom life is a great struggle.”
00:43:55 Might the widow have felt that her small gift
00:43:57 was too insignificant to matter?
00:44:01 I’ve felt that way before.
00:44:04 Jesus showed that the widow and her contribution
00:44:08 were valuable to Jehovah.
00:44:11 “This poor widow put in more than all the others . . .
00:44:16 She . . . put in everything she had.”
00:44:21 She gave her best.
00:44:25 When I give Jehovah my best,
00:44:27 no matter how much it is, it is precious to him.
00:44:34 Clearly, the Study Bible is designed to help us study
00:44:38 the Bible more deeply.
00:44:41 May this printed edition of Matthew through Acts
00:44:44 help you to come to know Jesus Christ,
00:44:46 the Son of God, better and better.
00:44:59 Remember that Jehovah set aside
00:45:01 a significant portion of his Word
00:45:05 for us to become acquainted with his Son, Jesus
00:45:09 —our Ransomer, our Leader and, of course, our King.
00:45:13 Jehovah wants us to know his Son.
00:45:16 He wants us to love his Son
00:45:18 and to put faith in his Son.
00:45:22 So by all means,
00:45:24 let’s—each and every one of us—use this new Bible
00:45:28 to make progress in coming to know the Son of God.
00:45:33 And as you do,
00:45:35 you will also be coming to know better
00:45:38 the One whom Jesus perfectly imitated,
00:45:41 our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:45:53 Thank you very much, Brother Herd.
00:45:57 We appreciate what we heard from you.
00:46:00 And what a blessing the Study Bible  has proven to be
00:46:05 for those who have it available in their language.

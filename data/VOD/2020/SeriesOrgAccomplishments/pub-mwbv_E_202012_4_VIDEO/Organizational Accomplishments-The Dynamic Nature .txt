00:00:10 The prophet Isaiah foretold
00:00:12 that ‘in the final part of the days,
00:00:15 ‘nations would stream
00:00:17 ‘to the mountain of Jehovah
00:00:19 ‘[his elevated pure worship]
00:00:21 to be instructed about his ways.’
00:00:25 In God’s organization,
00:00:27 we can all benefit from that divine education.
00:00:32 We also see the results
00:00:34 of Proverbs 4:18:
00:00:40 “The path of the righteous is like the bright morning light
00:00:45 that grows brighter and brighter.”
00:00:49 Naturally, what we learn
00:00:51 through the program of divine education
00:00:54 has to keep pace with our refined understanding
00:00:57 of Bible teachings.
00:01:00 To accomplish this,
00:01:02 the Teaching Committee of the Governing Body
00:01:05 oversees the work  of the Theocratic Schools Department
00:01:08 in Patterson, New York.
00:01:12 How do they keep the curriculums of our theocratic schools
00:01:16 up-to-date and effective
00:01:18 in training God’s people to do his will?
00:01:25 In the fall of 1942,
00:01:27 Brother Nathan Knorr wondered
00:01:29 if 1,000 pioneers could be found
00:01:31 who would be willing to go through Gilead
00:01:33 to ensure the school’s operation
00:01:35 for at least five years.
00:01:38 Nearly 80 years later,
00:01:41 Gilead School is still going strong,
00:01:44 and it’s not alone.
00:01:46 The Theocratic Schools Department
00:01:48 develops and maintains seven schools
00:01:51 under the direction of the Teaching Committee.
00:01:53 Together, these schools train God’s people
00:01:56 for theocratic assignments around the world.
00:01:59 But each school’s curriculum
00:02:01 needs continual review and updating.
00:02:03 Why?
00:02:05 We may receive new direction for a school from the Governing Body
00:02:09 or need to integrate Bible teachings
00:02:11 from new or updated publications.
00:02:14 Thanks to Jehovah’s rich blessing,
00:02:17 theocratic schools are being conducted
00:02:19 in 93 branch territories in 293 languages.
00:02:24 The amazing growth of these schools produces
00:02:27 a mammoth amount of work behind the scenes.
00:02:30 There are more than 2,000 documents that need to be put through a robust process
00:02:34 of formatting, proofreading,
00:02:36 editing, cross-checking for redundancy, and internal indexing.
00:02:39 Additionally, thousands of reference checks
00:02:43 that include scripture citations and publication references are made.
00:02:47 The schools are dynamic, so this work is continuous
00:02:51 to keep them up-to-date, accurate, and harmonious.
00:02:55 Once revisions are identified, the affected teaching outlines are adjusted.
00:03:00 Often, when a school is revised, a pilot class is taught.
00:03:04 Brothers from the Schools Department can observe
00:03:07 and listen to comments and suggestions from the instructors.
00:03:11 They can then make further adjustments
00:03:13 before the updated school is taught worldwide.
00:03:18 The theocratic schools are having a far-reaching effect.
00:03:22 How did the students feel about their training?
00:03:26 The training I received at Gilead was a big help
00:03:30 for my new assignment as a member of the Branch Committee.
00:03:34 It helped me not to be rule oriented or position oriented.
00:03:39 It helped me to understand how Jehovah
00:03:42 wants me to use authority
00:03:45 —to treat our brothers and sisters
00:03:48 in a humble and a friendly and a loving way,
00:03:51 to really take care of his sheep.
00:03:54 In October 2018, a special announcement was made.
00:04:00 We are pleased to inform you
00:04:02 that the Governing Body has given approval
00:04:06 for all field missionaries with an FMF enrollment
00:04:11 who have been serving for at least five years
00:04:16 to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, SKE.
00:04:22 SKE was very much a refresher course for us.
00:04:27 It helped us to be able to bring back to mind
00:04:30 things that we had learned from Gilead
00:04:32 and then improve upon them.
00:04:34 Going to SKE was just Jehovah’s way
00:04:38 of giving us that encouragement (that hug)
00:04:42 telling us that he loves us and giving us
00:04:45 the needed training to keep on going.
00:04:49 Brother Knorr may have wondered in 1942
00:04:52 if we’d ever find 1,000 students,
00:04:55 but by the tenth class of Gilead,
00:04:57 the 1,000th student had graduated.
00:05:00 In just the United States branch territory,
00:05:03 more than 1,000 students are being trained
00:05:06 in theocratic schools each week!
00:05:09 In our times, we see Isaiah 60:22 coming true:
00:05:14 “The little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation.”
00:05:18 Jehovah has blessed the use of theocratic schools
00:05:20 to contribute to this amazing growth.
00:05:23 And with such training,
00:05:25 he’s strengthening his people from the inside out
00:05:27 as he prepares us all for “the real life” to come.

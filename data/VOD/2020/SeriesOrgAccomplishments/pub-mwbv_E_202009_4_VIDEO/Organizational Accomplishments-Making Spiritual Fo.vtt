At Acts 1:8,

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold that the good news
would be preached

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:25.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, digital technology

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has greatly enhanced
our global preaching work

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as our Christian meetings.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More videos and digital publications

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being produced by Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than ever before.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in some parts of the earth,

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters
have great difficulty

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accessing this spiritual food.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:01.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it is the monthly JW Broadcasting® file,

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will not download during the day.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, the speed is the main challenge.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Internet connectivity is better at night.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be easier to download
the material if I stay up late.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Internet data bundles are very expensive.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we may buy them at 1,000
or 2,000 Malawi Kwacha ($1.35 to $2.70)

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this is a lot of money.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we weren’t able to download
the required publications

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:39.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our priority was
to provide food for the family.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult to have
meaningful family worship

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we didn’t have videos to use.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we could say
that we couldn’t increase

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our intake of spiritual food.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The difficulty in the town of Lisala,
where we live,

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that the network is very bad.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many outages.

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To get the publications and videos,

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked to a brother
who was traveling to Kinshasa.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gave him my tablet.

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine, three weeks

00:02:16.907 --> 00:02:20.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no study publications and no videos

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I felt like I was working in vain.

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To address these challenges,

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body has lovingly provided

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a simple yet effective solution.

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is it—JW Box.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:42.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s innovative and affordable,
and it can be set up in less than a minute.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You connect it to a USB device

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is preloaded with our videos
and publications,

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you plug this into an external
power source, like a battery.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:54.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the brothers there
can use their personal devices

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to connect to it over Wi-Fi.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because it’s
a local connection, it’s fast.

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:04.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch office preloads JW Boxes

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with approved content
already publicly available

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on jw.org® and <i>JW Library</i>®

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:17.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then distributes them
to the local congregations.

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also used
at assemblies and conventions.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one convention, publishers downloaded

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a newly released <i>New World Translation</i>
in their language

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right at the convention site.

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:34.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep the digital content up-to-date,

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:37.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the branch downloads new videos

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and digital publications

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:42.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
onto USB keys.

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Local congregations receive these keys

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with their literature shipment.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The materials we use for family worship

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have strengthened our family bond.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make it easier for us to help our girls.

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes it easier for them to give comments
after watching the videos for the meetings.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bonnie watched the videos and said,

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:10.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Daddy, I want to make
a contribution at the Kingdom Hall.”

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That lets me know that the video
touched her heart.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The videos have helped us a lot.

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:20.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at first, it was
very difficult for our child

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn songs from our songbook,

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:25.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because of the videos, it’s easy for her.

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now our relationship with Jehovah
is stronger,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including with our family and our children.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I use my phone in the field ministry
and at the meetings,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I use it to show videos
to my friends at school.

00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve started studying with them
because of these videos.

00:04:42.344 --> 00:04:47.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the videos that I show them
help me to reach their hearts.

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:50.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my field service report,
I would leave the “Video” section empty,

00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now it’s no longer empty.

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:54.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I report many videos.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people I study the Bible with
are very interested

00:04:57.192 --> 00:04:59.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in them, and I now have several studies

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they like to watch these videos.

00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Box has been a great help to our family

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:10.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the publications
and videos we can download now.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our children are learning
from the lessons shown

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:21.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate this provision so much

00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:24.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it helps to get spiritual food

00:05:24.094 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the hands and the hearts
of our brothers.

00:00:10 At Acts 1:8,
00:00:13 Jesus foretold that the good news would be preached
00:00:18 “to the most distant part of the earth.”
00:00:22 In recent years, digital technology
00:00:25 has greatly enhanced our global preaching work
00:00:29 as well as our Christian meetings.
00:00:32 More videos and digital publications
00:00:35 are being produced by Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:39 than ever before.
00:00:42 However, in some parts of the earth,
00:00:46 our brothers and sisters have great difficulty
00:00:50 accessing this spiritual food.
00:00:57 If it is the monthly JW Broadcasting® file,
00:01:01 it will not download during the day.
00:01:03 Basically, the speed is the main challenge.
00:01:09 Internet connectivity is better at night.
00:01:12 It will be easier to download the material if I stay up late.
00:01:23 Internet data bundles are very expensive.
00:01:25 Sometimes we may buy them at 1,000 or 2,000 Malawi Kwacha ($1.35 to $2.70)
00:01:30 —this is a lot of money.
00:01:32 Sometimes we weren’t able to download the required publications
00:01:35 because our priority was to provide food for the family.
00:01:41 It was difficult to have meaningful family worship
00:01:44 because we didn’t have videos to use.
00:01:48 In other words, we could say that we couldn’t increase
00:01:50 our intake of spiritual food.
00:01:56 The difficulty in the town of Lisala, where we live,
00:02:00 is that the network is very bad.
00:02:03 There are many outages.
00:02:05 To get the publications and videos,
00:02:08 I talked to a brother who was traveling to Kinshasa.
00:02:12 I gave him my tablet.
00:02:14 Now, imagine, three weeks
00:02:16 with no study publications and no videos
00:02:20 —I felt like I was working in vain.
00:02:24 To address these challenges,
00:02:27 the Governing Body has lovingly provided
00:02:30 a simple yet effective solution.
00:02:34 So this is it—JW Box.
00:02:37 It’s innovative and affordable, and it can be set up in less than a minute.
00:02:42 You connect it to a USB device
00:02:44 that is preloaded with our videos and publications,
00:02:47 and then you plug this into an external power source, like a battery.
00:02:51 And then the brothers there can use their personal devices
00:02:54 to connect to it over Wi-Fi.
00:02:56 And because it’s a local connection, it’s fast.
00:03:00 The branch office preloads JW Boxes
00:03:04 with approved content already publicly available
00:03:09 on jw.org® and JW Library®
00:03:13 and then distributes them to the local congregations.
00:03:17 They’re also used at assemblies and conventions.
00:03:21 At one convention, publishers downloaded
00:03:24 a newly released New World Translation in their language
00:03:29 right at the convention site.
00:03:31 To keep the digital content up-to-date,
00:03:34 the branch downloads new videos
00:03:37 and digital publications
00:03:39 onto USB keys.
00:03:42 Local congregations receive these keys
00:03:45 along with their literature shipment.
00:03:51 The materials we use for family worship
00:03:53 have strengthened our family bond.
00:03:57 They make it easier for us to help our girls.
00:04:00 It makes it easier for them to give comments after watching the videos for the meetings.
00:04:04 Bonnie watched the videos and said,
00:04:07 “Daddy, I want to make a contribution at the Kingdom Hall.”
00:04:10 That lets me know that the video touched her heart.
00:04:14 The videos have helped us a lot.
00:04:16 For example, at first, it was very difficult for our child
00:04:20 to learn songs from our songbook,
00:04:22 but because of the videos, it’s easy for her.
00:04:25 Now our relationship with Jehovah is stronger,
00:04:28 including with our family and our children.
00:04:31 I use my phone in the field ministry and at the meetings,
00:04:34 and I use it to show videos to my friends at school.
00:04:39 I’ve started studying with them because of these videos.
00:04:42 So the videos that I show them help me to reach their hearts.
00:04:47 In my field service report, I would leave the “Video” section empty,
00:04:50 but now it’s no longer empty.
00:04:52 I report many videos.
00:04:54 The people I study the Bible with are very interested
00:04:57 in them, and I now have several studies
00:04:59 because they like to watch these videos.
00:05:02 JW Box has been a great help to our family
00:05:06 because of the publications and videos we can download now.
00:05:10 Our children are learning from the lessons shown
00:05:13 in the Caleb and Sophia videos.
00:05:18 We appreciate this provision so much
00:05:21 because it helps to get spiritual food
00:05:24 into the hands and the hearts of our brothers.

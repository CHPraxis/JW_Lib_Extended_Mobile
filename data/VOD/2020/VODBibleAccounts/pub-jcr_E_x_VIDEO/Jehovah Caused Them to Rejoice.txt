00:00:01 “Serve Jehovah with rejoicing,”
00:00:04 says Psalm 100:2.
00:00:07 Yes, Jehovah wants us to be joyful.
00:00:11 And he’s given us many reasons to rejoice.
00:00:14 He gave us life with its many joys.
00:00:17 He gave us the Bible to teach us how to enjoy life.
00:00:21 And he guides us into countless joyful experiences.
00:00:26 Yes, Jehovah is the God who gives joy.
00:00:31 Satan, however, does not want us
00:00:33 to find joy in serving Jehovah.
00:00:35 Why not?
00:00:37 For one thing, he knows that joy helps us
00:00:40 to keep on preaching and teaching
00:00:43 —the very work he wants to stop.
00:00:45 So he tries to destroy our joy,
00:00:48 sometimes through official opposition
00:00:51 and at other times through family and community pressure.
00:00:55 Satan also wants us
00:00:58 to cut back our service to Jehovah
00:01:01 in order to obtain unnecessary material things.
00:01:05 He wants us to think that getting more and more material things
00:01:09 will bring us lasting joy.
00:01:12 It won’t.
00:01:13 Satan’s tactics are not new.
00:01:16 As we now read portions of the books
00:01:19 of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah,
00:01:22 look for lessons that can help us
00:01:24 to “serve Jehovah with rejoicing” today.
00:01:29 Note what brought Jehovah’s people joy back then
00:01:34 and what robbed them of their joy.
00:01:37 And consider why and how we  can experience
00:01:41 “the joy of Jehovah” today,
00:01:43 even under trying circumstances.
00:01:55 Ezra, a priest and a copyist of the Law of Moses,
00:01:58 is the writer of the book that bears his name.
00:02:02 The book of Ezra picks up the history of Israel
00:02:05 from the end of 2 Chronicles,
00:02:07 which likely Ezra also wrote.
00:02:10 It’s 537 B.C.E.,
00:02:13 and many Jews are about to return to Judah.
00:02:16 The nation has spent 70 years in captivity to Babylon
00:02:21 for practicing idol worship.
00:02:23 They’ve learned a hard lesson,
00:02:26 and never again does the entire nation
00:02:29 fall back into idolatry.
00:02:32 Now the time has come to get pure worship
00:02:37 back on its feet in Jerusalem.
00:02:41 The account spans the reigns
00:02:43 of several Persian kings,
00:02:45 starting with King Cyrus,
00:02:47 and it has a joyful beginning.
00:02:50 Please open to Ezra 1:1-6, and follow along.
00:02:56 “In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia,
00:02:58 “in order that Jehovah’s word spoken by Jeremiah would be fulfilled,
00:03:02 “Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia
00:03:05 “to make a proclamation throughout his kingdom,
00:03:08 which he also put in writing, saying:”
00:03:11 “This is what King Cyrus of Persia says,
00:03:15 “‘Jehovah the God of the heavens
00:03:18 “‘has given me all the kingdoms of the earth,
00:03:21 “‘and he has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem,
00:03:24 “‘which is in Judah.
00:03:27 “‘Whoever there is among you of all his people,
00:03:29 “‘may his God be with him,
00:03:32 “‘and let him go up to Jerusalem,  which is in Judah,
00:03:35 “‘and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel
00:03:39 “‘—he is the true God—
00:03:41 “‘whose house was in Jerusalem.
00:03:43 “‘Anyone who is residing as a foreigner,
00:03:46 “‘wherever he may be,
00:03:48 “‘let him be helped by his neighbors
00:03:50 “‘by their giving him silver and gold,
00:03:53 “‘goods and livestock,
00:03:55 “‘along with the voluntary offering  for the house of the true God,
00:03:58 which was in Jerusalem.’”
00:04:01 “Then the heads of the paternal houses of Judah and of Benjamin
00:04:06 “and the priests and the Levites
00:04:08 “—everyone whose spirit the true God had stirred—
00:04:11 “prepared to go up and rebuild the house of Jehovah,
00:04:15 “which was in Jerusalem.
00:04:17 “All those around them supported them
00:04:19 “by giving them utensils of silver and of gold,
00:04:22 “goods, livestock, and valuable things,
00:04:26 besides all the voluntary offerings.”
00:04:29 Just imagine!
00:04:30 Jehovah returns the Jews to their land
00:04:33 with a commission from King Cyrus himself to rebuild the temple.
00:04:39 Many Jews joyfully take up this assignment.
00:04:42 However, those who for various reasons cannot return
00:04:46 give financial support to those who can.
00:04:49 Likely in the early spring of 537 B.C.E.,
00:04:53 nearly 50,000 Israelites depart Babylon.
00:04:57 Leading them are high priest Jeshua,
00:05:00 also called Joshua,
00:05:03 and the governor whom Cyrus appointed,
00:05:05 Zerubbabel.
00:05:08 In the early autumn, they arrive in Judah,
00:05:11 and they are joyful!
00:05:13 But how can they sustain that joy?
00:05:16 Note what they do as soon as they get settled.
00:05:20 Let’s read Ezra 3:1-6:
00:05:24 “When the seventh month arrived  and the Israelites were in their cities,
00:05:29 “they gathered together with one accord in Jerusalem.
00:05:33 “Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and his fellow priests
00:05:36 “and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers
00:05:40 “rose up and built the altar of the God of Israel,
00:05:43 “so that they could offer up burnt sacrifices on it,
00:05:47 “as it is written in the Law of Moses  the man of the true God.
00:05:51 “So they set the altar up on its former site,
00:05:54 “despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands,
00:05:58 “and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah on it,
00:06:01 “the morning and the evening burnt sacrifices.
00:06:05 “Then they held the Festival of Booths according to what is written,
00:06:09 “and day by day they offered up the specified number of burnt sacrifices
00:06:13 “that were required each day.
00:06:15 “Afterward they offered up the regular burnt offering
00:06:19 “and the offerings for the new moons
00:06:21 “and those for all the sanctified festival seasons of Jehovah,
00:06:25 “as well as those from everyone
00:06:27 “who willingly offered a voluntary offering to Jehovah.
00:06:31 “From the first day of the seventh month
00:06:33 “they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah,
00:06:37 “though the foundation of Jehovah’s temple
00:06:39 had not yet been laid.”
00:06:41 Did you notice that the Jews reinstitute Jehovah’s worship
00:06:46 “despite their fear of the peoples of the surrounding lands”?
00:06:51 Because of their courageous action,
00:06:54 this is a very joyful time.
00:06:57 It’s just as Moses said when he instructed the nation
00:07:00 to celebrate the Festival of Booths:
00:07:03 “You will become nothing but joyful”!
00:07:07 The next year, they courageously
00:07:10 and joyfully lay the foundation for the temple.
00:07:13 Let’s read about that at Ezra 3:10-13:
00:07:19 “When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah,
00:07:23 “then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets,
00:07:27 “and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals,
00:07:30 “stood up to praise Jehovah
00:07:33 “according to the direction of King David of Israel.
00:07:37 “And they began to sing in response
00:07:39 “by praising and giving thanks to Jehovah,
00:07:42 “‘for he is good; his loyal love toward Israel endures forever.’
00:07:49 “Then all the people shouted with a loud shout of praise to Jehovah
00:07:53 “because the foundation of the house of Jehovah had been laid.
00:07:58 “Many of the priests, the Levites, and the heads of the paternal houses
00:08:03 “—the old men who had seen the former house—
00:08:06 “wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid,
00:08:11 “while many others shouted joyfully at the top of their voice.
00:08:15 “So the people could not distinguish
00:08:18 “the sound of the joyful shouts from the sound of the weeping,
00:08:21 “for the people were shouting so loudly
00:08:24 that the sound was heard from a great distance.”
00:08:28 Yes, some of the oldest members of the nation
00:08:31 cannot imagine how this temple could possibly match
00:08:36 the glory of Solomon’s temple.
00:08:38 But the others’ joyful shouting overpowers their weeping.
00:08:43 The people of the surrounding lands, however,
00:08:46 do not rejoice.
00:08:49 Instead, they cunningly target Israel’s joy.
00:08:53 Let’s see how in Ezra chapter 4:1-3:
00:08:58 “When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard
00:09:01 “that the returned exiles were building a temple to Jehovah the God of Israel,
00:09:06 “they immediately approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the paternal houses
00:09:10 and said to them:”
00:09:12 “Let us build along with you;
00:09:15 “for like you, we worship your God
00:09:18 “and we have been sacrificing to him
00:09:20 “since the days of King Esar-haddon of Assyria,
00:09:23 who brought us here.”
00:09:25 “However, Zerubbabel and Jeshua
00:09:28 “and the rest of the heads of the paternal houses of Israel
00:09:30 said to them:”
00:09:32 “You have no share with us in building a house to our God,
00:09:36 “for we alone will build it to Jehovah the God of Israel,
00:09:39 just as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”
00:09:44 Zerubbabel discerns that behind their enemies’ offer to help
00:09:49 lurk bad motives.
00:09:51 When he rejects their offer,
00:09:53 they try to prevent the Jews from working on the temple.
00:09:57 Notice how verses 4 to 7 continue:
00:10:01 “Then the people of the land
00:10:04 “were continually discouraging the people of Judah
00:10:07 “and disheartening them from building.
00:10:09 “They hired advisers against them to frustrate their plans
00:10:13 “all the days of King Cyrus of Persia until the reign of King Darius of Persia.
00:10:18 “At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus,
00:10:20 “they wrote an accusation
00:10:22 “against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
00:10:25 “And in the days of King Artaxerxes of Persia,
00:10:28 “Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his colleagues
00:10:33 “wrote to Artaxerxes the king;
00:10:35 “they translated the letter into Aramaic,
00:10:37 writing it with Aramaic characters.”
00:10:42 Let’s read what Rehum, the chief government official,
00:10:45 and others of Israel’s enemies write to the king.
00:10:49 Consider what kind of false accusations they make,
00:10:52 as recorded at Ezra 4:11-16:
00:10:57 “This is a copy of the letter that they sent him.”
00:11:02 “To King Artaxerxes from your servants,
00:11:05 “the men of the region Beyond the River:
00:11:08 “And now let it be known to the king
00:11:12 “that the Jews who came up here from you to us have arrived at Jerusalem.
00:11:17 “They are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city,
00:11:21 “and they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.
00:11:25 “Now let it be known to the king
00:11:27 “that if this city should be rebuilt and its walls finished,
00:11:31 “they will not give tax, tribute, or toll,
00:11:35 “and it will result in a loss to the treasuries of the kings.
00:11:40 “Since we eat the salt of the palace
00:11:43 “and it is not proper for us to see the king’s interests harmed,
00:11:47 “we have therefore sent to make this known to the king,
00:11:52 “so that there may be an investigation
00:11:54 “of the book of records of your ancestors.
00:11:57 “You will find in the book of records
00:12:00 “and learn that this city is a rebellious city,
00:12:03 “injurious to kings and provinces,
00:12:07 “and within it have been those stirring up sedition
00:12:10 “from ancient times.
00:12:13 “That is why this city was destroyed.
00:12:16 “We are making known to the king
00:12:19 “that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished,
00:12:23 you will have no control of the region Beyond the River.”
00:12:28 Do those false accusations sound familiar?
00:12:31 They are the same ones our enemies sometimes hurl against us today:
00:12:36 “They don’t pay taxes.
00:12:38 “They work against the government’s interests.
00:12:41 “They are rebellious and seditious.
00:12:44 They’re uncontrollable.”
00:12:46 All false charges, of course!
00:12:49 And back then, they had their effect.
00:12:53 The king orders the work halted,
00:12:56 and temple rebuilding comes to a standstill.
00:12:59 How sad!
00:13:00 When the Jews first returned,
00:13:02 they didn’t let fear of man
00:13:05 stop them from doing Jehovah’s work.
00:13:08 But now they do.
00:13:10 Many of us today
00:13:12 face increasing opposition to Jehovah’s work.
00:13:15 But compromising or giving up
00:13:18 has never brought anyone joy
00:13:21 —just the opposite.
00:13:23 Remaining faithful brings joy,
00:13:26 even in the face of violent persecution.
00:13:29 But how is that possible?
00:13:32 Consider a true-life example.
00:13:34 Picture a mother and daughter
00:13:37 surrounded by a mob of angry men
00:13:40 demanding that they buy political party cards.
00:13:43 What would the sisters do?
00:13:45 If they compromised and bought the cards,
00:13:48 their persecutors would rejoice.
00:13:50 But afterward the sisters would be miserable,
00:13:54 knowing they had denied their heavenly Father.
00:13:57 The sisters did not give in.
00:14:00 Of course, they didn’t enjoy being ridiculed and mistreated.
00:14:04 Later, however, their consciences were clean.
00:14:08 And they felt deep joy,
00:14:10 knowing they had remained faithful to Jehovah.
00:14:15 What about the Jews of Ezra’s day?
00:14:18 Many may have left a stable life in Babylon
00:14:21 to make the arduous trek to Judah.
00:14:24 Now, after about 14 years of constant opposition,
00:14:28 from the laying of the temple’s foundation up to the ban,
00:14:32 the Jews have lost their zeal for Jehovah’s work.
00:14:36 They go through the motions of offering sacrifices,
00:14:40 but they are not doing what Jehovah told  them to do
00:14:45 —finish rebuilding the temple!
00:14:47 When they meet resistance,
00:14:49 they rationalize that it must not be
00:14:52 Jehovah’s time to finish the work.
00:14:55 Apparently, even Governor Zerubbabel
00:14:57 and high priest Jeshua need encouragement.
00:15:00 To provide it, Jehovah sends the prophet Haggai.
00:15:05 Let’s turn now to the book of Haggai, chapter 1.
00:15:09 Haggai’s clear and powerful messages,
00:15:11 delivered during a period of about four months,
00:15:14 get right to the heart of the matter,
00:15:17 as we read at Haggai 1:2-11:
00:15:22 “This is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:15:25 “‘These people say,
00:15:27 “The time has not yet come for the house of Jehovah to be built.”’
00:15:31 “And the word of Jehovah again came through Haggai the prophet, saying:
00:15:35 “‘Is it the time for you to dwell in your paneled houses,
00:15:40 “‘while this house lies in ruins?
00:15:43 “‘Now this is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:15:46 “‘“Set your heart on your ways.
00:15:49 “‘“You have sown much seed, but you harvest little.
00:15:53 “‘“You eat, but it is not to satisfaction.
00:15:56 “‘“You drink, but you do not drink your fill.
00:15:59 “‘“You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.
00:16:03 “‘“The one who hires himself out
00:16:06 “puts his wages in a bag full of holes.”’
00:16:09 “This is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:16:13 “‘Set your heart on your ways.
00:16:16 “‘Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber.
00:16:19 “‘And build the house,
00:16:22 “so that I may take pleasure in it  and I may be glorified,’ Jehovah says.
00:16:27 “‘You were expecting much and receiving little;
00:16:31 “‘and when you brought it into the house, I blew it away.
00:16:35 “For what reason?’ declares Jehovah of armies.
00:16:38 “‘Because my house is in ruins,
00:16:41 “‘while each of you runs around taking care of his own house.
00:16:45 “‘So the heavens above you withheld their dew,
00:16:48 “‘and the earth withheld its produce.
00:16:51 “‘And I kept calling for a drought on the earth,
00:16:54 “‘on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine,
00:16:58 “‘on the oil, on what grows from the ground,
00:17:01 on humans and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.’”
00:17:07 Jehovah compares the results of the Jews’ self-centered efforts
00:17:10 to those of a hired worker who puts
00:17:12 his wages into a moth-eaten sack.
00:17:16 Because the Jews are neglecting the house of Jehovah,
00:17:19 he holds back his blessing.
00:17:21 The results of the Jews’ labor are limited,
00:17:24 and their lives lack joy.
00:17:27 Evidently, some try to fill that void
00:17:30 by beautifying their own homes.
00:17:34 But material  things cannot satisfy spiritual needs.
00:17:38 Can we see the warning here for us?
00:17:41 It’s not wrong to enjoy nice things.
00:17:45 But material things cannot bring us true and lasting joy,
00:17:50 especially if we neglect Jehovah’s work to obtain them.
00:17:55 Remember the lesson of Psalm 127:1:
00:17:58 “Unless Jehovah builds the house,
00:18:00 “it is in vain
00:18:02 that its builders work hard on it.”
00:18:05 On the other hand, when we unselfishly ‘seek first
00:18:09 God’s Kingdom and his righteousness,’
00:18:12 he  provides what we really need
00:18:14 and at just the right time.
00:18:18 As Proverbs 10:22 tells us:
00:18:22 “It is the blessing of Jehovah
00:18:25 “that makes one rich,
00:18:27 and He adds no pain  with it.”
00:18:30 But now, will this rebuilt temple really not attain to its former glory,
00:18:34 as some believe?
00:18:36 Through Haggai, Jehovah guarantees
00:18:39 that the future glory of this house
00:18:41 will be even greater.
00:18:44 Let’s continue reading at Haggai 2:3-9.
00:18:49 “‘Who is left among you  who saw this house in its former glory?
00:18:54 “‘How does it look to you now?
00:18:57 “‘Does it not seem like nothing in comparison?
00:19:00 “But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares Jehovah,
00:19:05 “‘and be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
00:19:09 “And be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares Jehovah,
00:19:13 “‘and work.
00:19:15 “For I am with you,’ declares Jehovah of armies.
00:19:19 “‘Remember what I promised you when you came out of Egypt,
00:19:23 “‘and my spirit remains among you.
00:19:25 “Do not be afraid.’
00:19:27 “For this is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:19:30 “‘Yet once more —in a little while—
00:19:33 “‘and I will shake the heavens and the earth
00:19:36 “‘and the sea and the dry land.
00:19:38 “‘And I will shake all the nations,
00:19:41 “‘and the precious things of all the nations will come in;
00:19:45 “and I will fill this house with glory,’ says Jehovah of armies.
00:19:50 “‘The silver is mine,
00:19:52 “and the gold is mine,’ declares Jehovah of armies.
00:19:56 “‘The future glory of this house
00:19:58 will be greater than the former,’ says Jehovah of armies.”
00:20:03 Yes, when the Creator and Owner of the entire universe declares his purpose,
00:20:08 who or what could possibly prevent him from carrying it out?
00:20:13 Nothing and no one!
00:20:16 Jehovah’s straightforward message is unmistakable.
00:20:20 Still, the returnees need more encouragement.
00:20:23 Jehovah sends his angel
00:20:25 to another prophet, Zechariah.
00:20:29 Please turn to Zechariah 1:12-16,
00:20:34 and let’s read together the angel’s reassuring words for Israel.
00:20:39 That’s Zechariah 1:12-16.
00:20:45 “So the angel of Jehovah said:”
00:20:48 “O Jehovah of armies,
00:20:50 “how long will you withhold your mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah,
00:20:55 with whom you have been indignant these 70 years?”
00:20:59 “Jehovah answered the angel who was speaking with me,
00:21:02 “with kind and comforting words.
00:21:05 Then the angel who was speaking with me told me:”
00:21:08 “Call out,  ‘This is what Jehovah of armies says:
00:21:13 “‘“I am zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great zeal.
00:21:17 “‘“With great indignation I am indignant with the nations that are at ease,
00:21:22 “‘“because I felt indignant to a small extent,
00:21:25 “‘but they added to the calamity.”
00:21:28 “‘Therefore this is what Jehovah says:
00:21:31 “‘“I will return to Jerusalem with mercy,
00:21:34 “‘and my own house will be built in her,” declares Jehovah of armies,
00:21:39 “and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’”
00:21:44 To emphasize just how protective Jehovah will be,
00:21:47 the angel continues, at chapter 2, verses 7-9:
00:21:52 “Come, Zion!
00:21:55 “Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.
00:21:59 “For this is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:22:02 “who after being glorified has sent me to the nations that were plundering you:
00:22:07 “‘Whoever touches you  touches the pupil of my eye.
00:22:12 “‘For now I will wave my hand against them,
00:22:15 “and they will become plunder for their own slaves.’
00:22:19 And you will certainly know that Jehovah of armies has sent me.”
00:22:24 Would you let someone poke his finger in your eye?
00:22:28 Of course not!
00:22:30 Neither will Jehovah allow Israel’s opposers to harm them.
00:22:34 Then, in Zechariah 3:1, 2,
00:22:38 the angel reveals  the greater enemy behind the opposition.
00:22:43 “And he showed me Joshua the high priest  standing before the angel of Jehovah,
00:22:48 “and Satan was standing at his right hand to resist him.
00:22:52 Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan:”
00:22:55 “May Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan,
00:22:59 “yes, may Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you!
00:23:03 Is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire?”
00:23:09 Is all this intended simply to build up
00:23:13 Israel’s confidence in themselves?
00:23:15 On the contrary!
00:23:17 They need to remember that only with Jehovah’s help
00:23:22 can they accomplish anything.
00:23:25 Listen to the angel’s further words
00:23:27 to Zechariah in chapter 4, verses 6, 7:
00:23:31 “This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel:
00:23:35 “‘Not by a military force, nor by power,
00:23:38 “but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.
00:23:42 “Who are you, O great mountain?
00:23:45 “Before Zerubbabel you will become a level land.
00:23:49 “And he will bring out the top stone amid shouts of:
00:23:53 ‘How wonderful! How wonderful!’”
00:23:57 Energized by Jehovah’s motivating words
00:24:00 through his two prophets,
00:24:02 the Jews stop wavering in a lack of faith and resume
00:24:05 construction of the temple.
00:24:07 Predictably, Israel’s enemy neighbors,
00:24:10 led by Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai,
00:24:13 also spring into action.
00:24:16 Returning to the book of Ezra,
00:24:18 we read at chapter 5, verses 3-5:
00:24:22 “At that time Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River
00:24:26 and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and asked them:”
00:24:30 “Who issued an order to you to build this house
00:24:34 and to finish this structure?”
00:24:36 “Then they asked them:”
00:24:38 “What are the names of the men who are working on this building?”
00:24:42 “But God was watching over the elders of the Jews,
00:24:45 “and they did not stop them until the report could be sent to Darius
00:24:49 and an official document could be sent back concerning this.”
00:24:53 So there is another lesson for us today:
00:24:55 When we courageously do Jehovah’s work despite opposition,
00:25:00 Jehovah blesses our efforts
00:25:02 and enables us to keep on serving him.
00:25:06 For now, though, the Jews must continue their work
00:25:09 on the temple under ban.
00:25:11 The king who issued  the ban, however,
00:25:14 was assassinated after reigning only seven months.
00:25:18 So Tattenai and his accomplices
00:25:20 are dealing with a new  king, Darius I.
00:25:26 In denouncing the Jews,
00:25:28 they try to use Zerubbabel’s own words against him,
00:25:32 including his statement that King Cyrus
00:25:34 issued the order to rebuild the temple.
00:25:37 They ask King Darius to investigate whether that’s really so.
00:25:43 Darius orders the investigation.
00:25:46 What will King Darius decide?
00:25:49 Will the Jews’ renewed faith and determination bring them joy?
00:25:52 or just more trouble?
00:25:55 Darius learns that Cyrus did indeed order that the temple be rebuilt.
00:26:00 At Ezra 6:6-12, we read
00:26:05 Darius’ stinging reply.
00:26:08 “So now Tattenai the governor of the region Beyond the River,
00:26:13 “Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues,
00:26:16 “the lesser governors of the region Beyond the River
00:26:19 “—stay away from there.
00:26:21 “Do not interfere with the work on that house of God.
00:26:24 “The governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews
00:26:27 “will rebuild that house of God in its former place.
00:26:31 “Furthermore, I am issuing an order
00:26:34 “as to what you are to do for these elders of the Jews
00:26:36 “for rebuilding that house of God:
00:26:39 “From the royal treasury,
00:26:41 “from the tax collected in the region Beyond the River,
00:26:44 “the expenses are to be promptly given to these men
00:26:47 “to continue without interruption.
00:26:49 “And whatever is needed
00:26:52 “—young bulls as well as rams and lambs
00:26:54 “for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven,
00:26:57 “wheat, salt, wine, and oil,
00:27:01 “just as the priests who are in Jerusalem say—
00:27:03 “is to be given them continually
00:27:06 “day by day without fail,
00:27:09 “so that they may continually present offerings
00:27:12 “that please the God of the heavens
00:27:14 “and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
00:27:18 “I have also issued an order that if anyone violates this decree,
00:27:23 “a timber will be pulled out of his house
00:27:26 “and he will be lifted up and fastened to it,
00:27:29 “and his house will be turned into a public latrine for this offense.
00:27:34 “And may the God who has caused his name to reside there
00:27:37 “overthrow any king and people who lift a hand
00:27:41 “to violate this order and destroy that house of God,
00:27:45 “which is in Jerusalem.
00:27:47 “I, Darius, issue this order.
00:27:50 Let it be done promptly.”
00:27:54 Upon receiving the king’s command, Tattenai and his colleagues have no choice.
00:27:59 Not only must they stop interfering with the work on the temple,
00:28:03 they must help finance it!
00:28:06 What a joyful outcome for the faithful Jews.
00:28:10 In 515 B.C.E.,
00:28:12 they hold the inauguration of the house of God with joy,
00:28:17 and as we read at verse 22:
00:28:21 “They also joyfully held
00:28:23 “the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days,
00:28:25 “for Jehovah caused them to rejoice
00:28:28 “and he had made the heart of the king of Assyria favorable toward them,
00:28:32 “so that he supported them in the work of the house of the true God,
00:28:36 the God of Israel.”
00:28:40 Today, when wise and just officials similarly intervene in our behalf,
00:28:45 we’re very grateful to them.
00:28:47 But we’re most grateful to Jehovah for directing matters.
00:28:51 As Proverbs 21:1 says:
00:28:54 “A king’s heart is like streams of water
00:28:57 “in Jehovah’s hand.
00:28:59 He directs it wherever He pleases.”
00:29:02 So we do not put our ultimate hope in any ruler
00:29:06 or institution of this world.
00:29:09 None of them can bring us permanent salvation.
00:29:13 In fact, before the end of Satan’s system,
00:29:16 all the nations will turn against Jehovah’s people.
00:29:20 But they’ll experience an outcome worse than that of Tattenai’s.
00:29:25 What lessons can we  draw
00:29:27 from these portions of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah?
00:29:32 First, Jehovah blesses our determined efforts
00:29:35 to keep on doing his work despite challenges,
00:29:39 but he frustrates the efforts of our opposers.
00:29:43 Second, when we put Jehovah’s work ahead of material comforts,
00:29:46 he gives us true joy.
00:29:50 What’s the work Jesus commissioned us to do today?
00:29:54 He made it very clear in his parting words to his followers:
00:29:58 “Go, therefore, and make disciples
00:30:02 of people of all the nations.”
00:30:05 Are we, with our hearts and hands,
00:30:09 putting this assignment ahead of material goals?
00:30:12 Haggai foretold that one day,
00:30:15 Jehovah’s temple would become far more glorious
00:30:19 than the one Solomon built.
00:30:22 That prophecy is being fulfilled today.
00:30:25 Jehovah is using our preaching to shake the nations.
00:30:30 Millions of “precious things” —new worshippers—
00:30:34 are coming to him.
00:30:37 These are joyfully flocking to the great spiritual temple
00:30:41 —Jehovah’s arrangement for worshipping him
00:30:44 on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.
00:30:48 Now is not the time to focus our attention
00:30:52 on “paneled houses”
00:30:54 or on any other unnecessary pursuit.
00:30:58 Very soon, on a day we do not expect,
00:31:02 Satan’s world will end,
00:31:05 and we will enter Jehovah’s new world.
00:31:08 So no matter how Satan tries to discourage
00:31:12 or distract us now,
00:31:14 may we never let him rob us
00:31:17 of our joy in Jehovah!
00:31:19 May we, rather, walk with Jehovah
00:31:22 right into his peaceful new world,
00:31:25 where we will serve him forever with rejoicing.
00:31:30 Zerubbabel,
00:31:31 Jeshua,
00:31:32 Haggai,
00:31:34 and Zechariah have done much
00:31:37 to help Israel regain Jehovah’s favor.
00:31:41 Later, in 468 B.C.E.,
00:31:43 Ezra himself comes to Jerusalem to support true worship.
00:31:47 But the nation needs still more direction.
00:31:51 So Jehovah sends them another brave leader.
00:31:56 During the next two days of this convention,
00:31:59 we’ll learn about that faithful and powerful man
00:32:03 —Nehemiah.

In the present system of things,

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:06.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us experience trials.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you ever wonder
whether Jehovah will act in your behalf?

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if so, when?

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:17.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be certain that Jehovah
will support us during our trials.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah’s foremost attribute

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an especially heartwarming quality
—love.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To learn about this quality,
including how we can show it ourselves,

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s examine the Bible account of Joseph.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph was born

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 3,700 years ago in Mesopotamia.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His father was the patriarch, Jacob,

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also known as Israel.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph had ten half brothers

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:52.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one full brother, Benjamin.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a tender age, Joseph began to face adversity

00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the jealousy of his ten older brothers.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Joseph’s trials

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to the saving of his whole family from famine.

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than that, as a result of his trials,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can receive everlasting blessings.

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to read along in your Bible

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you listen to Genesis 37:2-11.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Joseph was 17 years old,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the young man was tending the flock

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:33.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah,

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the wives of his father.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:39.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Joseph brought a bad report
about them to their father.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Israel loved Joseph
more than all his other sons

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because he was the son of his old age,

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had a special robe made for him.

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When his brothers saw that their father
loved him more than all his brothers,

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they began to hate him,
and they could not speak peaceably to him.

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Later Joseph had a dream
and told it to his brothers,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they found further reason to hate him.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:10.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Please listen to this dream that I had.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘There we were binding sheaves
in the middle of the field

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘when my sheaf got up and stood erect

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and your sheaves encircled
and bowed down to my sheaf.’

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His brothers said to him:

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:28.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Are you really going to make yourself
king over us and dominate us?’

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they found another reason to hate him,

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of his dreams and what he said.

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that he had still another dream,

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he related it to his brothers:

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I have had another dream.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This time the sun and the moon

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:50.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and 11 stars were bowing down to me.’

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:54.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he related it to his father
as well as his brothers,

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his father rebuked him and said to him:

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What is the meaning of this dream of yours?

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:03.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Am I as well as your mother and your brothers

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“really going to come
and bow down to the earth to you?’

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And his brothers grew jealous of him,

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his father kept the saying in mind.”

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:22.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph’s family find it difficult
to accept the meaning of his dreams!

00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:25.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jacob ‘keeps the saying,’

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, he keeps Joseph’s dreams “in mind.”

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:32.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He keeps thinking the matter over.

00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps he realizes
that his son’s dreams are from Jehovah.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph’s brothers, however,
have a different reaction.

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Follow along in Genesis 37:18-36.

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now they caught sight of him from a distance,

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and before he reached them,

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they began plotting
against him to put him to death.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they said to one another:

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! Here comes that dreamer.

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:06.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, now, let us kill him
and pitch him into one of the waterpits,

00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and we will say
that a vicious wild animal devoured him.

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then let us see
what will become of his dreams.’

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Reuben heard this, 
he tried to rescue him from them.

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:19.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he said:

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let us not take his life.’

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Reuben said to them:

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:25.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not shed blood.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Throw him into this waterpit in the wilderness,

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:30.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but do not harm him.’

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His purpose was to rescue him from them

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to return him to his father.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So as soon as Joseph came to his brothers,

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:43.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they stripped Joseph of his robe,
the special robe that he wore,

00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:46.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they took him
and threw him into the waterpit.

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the time the pit was empty;
there was no water in it.

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:53.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then they sat down to eat.

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:55.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they looked up,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there was a caravan of Ishmaelites
coming from Gilead.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their camels were carrying labdanum gum,

00:05:01.822 --> 00:05:04.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“balsam, and resinous bark,

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they were on their way down to Egypt.

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:10.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Judah said to his brothers:

00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What profit would there be
if we killed our brother

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and covered over his blood?

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, now, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites,

“‘and do not let our hand be upon him.

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After all, he is our brother, our flesh.’

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:27.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they listened to their brother.

00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:31.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And when the Midianite merchants 
were passing by,

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:34.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they lifted Joseph up out of the waterpit

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:38.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and sold him to the Ishmaelites
for 20 pieces of silver.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:42.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These men took Joseph into Egypt.

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:45.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Later when Reuben returned to the waterpit

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:48.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and saw that Joseph was not in the waterpit,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he ripped his garments apart.

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:54.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he returned to his brothers, he exclaimed:

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The child is gone!

00:05:57.085 --> 00:06:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I
—what am I going to do?’

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:04.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they took Joseph’s robe
and slaughtered a male goat

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and dipped the robe in the blood.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that they sent the special robe 
to their father and said:

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:14.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is what we found.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:19.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please examine
whether this is your son’s robe or not.’

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he examined it and exclaimed:

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is my son’s robe!

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘A vicious wild animal must have devoured him!

“Joseph is surely torn to pieces!’

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:36.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that Jacob ripped his garments apart

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and put sackcloth around his waist

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and mourned his son for many days.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And all his sons and all his daughters

00:06:45.926 --> 00:06:48.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“kept trying to comfort him,

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:52.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he kept refusing to take comfort, saying:

00:06:52.182 --> 00:06:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will go down into the Grave mourning my son!’

00:06:57.104 --> 00:07:00.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And his father continued weeping for him.

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now the Midianites
sold him in Egypt to Potiphar,

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a court official of Pharaoh
and the chief of the guard.”

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:13.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a drastic change

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:17.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from favorite son to lowly slave!

00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:21.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph’s brothers
not only fail to show loyal love to him,

00:07:21.753 --> 00:07:25.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they fail to show love
to their father, Jacob,

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:29.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,
to their heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithful servants of Jehovah
are not always shielded from injustice.

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:37.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, injustice may befall us

00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:40.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even at the hands of a fellow believer.

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you in the middle of a trial like that?

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:47.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, your trial gives you a unique opportunity

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:49.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prove your love for Jehovah.

00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:51.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:55.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider how Joseph responded to his trial.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what Genesis 39:1-23 says.

00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:05.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt,

“As a result, he became successful

everything that he did successful.

“Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he appointed him over his house,

the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph,

came to be on all that he had

“He eventually left everything
that was his in Joseph’s care,

except the food he was eating.

“Moreover, Joseph grew
to be well-built and handsome.

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:16.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now after these things,

00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the wife of his master

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“‘Lie down with me.’

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:28.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“and actually sin against God?’

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

with her or to remain with her.

“none of the household servants
were in the house.

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

by his garment and said:

“‘Lie down with me!’

00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:16.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he left his garment in her hand

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:19.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As soon as she saw
that he had left his garment in her hand

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:22.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and had fled outside,

00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:26.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“she began to cry out
to the men of her house and to say to them:

“‘Look! He brought to us this Hebrew man

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that she laid his garment beside her

00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until his master came to his house.

00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:58.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then she told him the same thing, saying:

“‘The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As soon as his master heard the words
his wife spoke to him, saying:

00:11:17.697 --> 00:11:20.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘These are the things your servant did to me,’

00:11:20.492 --> 00:11:22.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“his anger blazed.

00:11:22.702 --> 00:11:26.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Joseph’s master took him
and gave him over to the prison,

00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:30.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the place where the prisoners
of the king were kept under arrest,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he remained there in the prison.

00:11:33.713 --> 00:11:38.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jehovah continued with Joseph
and kept showing loyal love to him

00:11:38.468 --> 00:11:42.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and granting him favor
in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:44.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the chief officer of the prison

00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:48.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put Joseph in charge
of all the prisoners in the prison,

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:51.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and everything that they were doing there,

00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:53.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was the one having it done.

00:11:53.567 --> 00:11:55.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The chief officer of the prison

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was looking after absolutely nothing
that was in Joseph’s care,

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:01.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jehovah was with Joseph

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:05.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah made whatever he did successful.”

00:12:07.914 --> 00:12:11.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph remains under Jehovah’s watchful care,

00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:15.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah makes
whatever Joseph does successful.

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:20.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is Jehovah so attached to Joseph?

00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:24.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Joseph maintains
unshakable love for God.

00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph’s experience teaches us

00:12:28.184 --> 00:12:31.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we maintain our love for Jehovah,

00:12:31.354 --> 00:12:34.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will not abandon us!

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:39.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, He will provide
just what we need at the right time

00:12:39.112 --> 00:12:41.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we may endure.

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:44.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Returning to Joseph’s story,

00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:48.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find he’s assigned
to care for two special prisoners

00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:51.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Pharaoh’s personal cupbearer

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his chief baker.

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:58.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night, they each have a puzzling dream.

00:12:58.256 --> 00:13:03.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah enables Joseph
to interpret those dreams accurately,

00:13:03.094 --> 00:13:05.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the dreams are fulfilled.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that at Genesis 40:14,

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:13.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph entreats the cupbearer with the words:

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must remember me
when things go well with you.

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:21.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please show me loyal love
and mention me to Pharaoh,

00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:24.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to get me out of this place.”

00:13:24.783 --> 00:13:29.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the cupbearer forgets all about Joseph.

00:13:29.162 --> 00:13:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually,

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:34.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pharaoh himself has two baffling dreams

00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:38.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of plump cattle eaten by skinny ones

00:13:38.797 --> 00:13:42.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other of choice ears of grain

00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:45.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
swallowed by shriveled ones.

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:47.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of the priests and wise men in Egypt

00:13:47.972 --> 00:13:50.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to interpret these dreams.

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:54.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the cupbearer tells Pharaoh

00:13:54.104 --> 00:13:58.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Joseph’s amazing ability
to interpret dreams.

00:13:58.483 --> 00:14:01.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph is quickly summoned from prison.

00:14:02.487 --> 00:14:07.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we resume our reading from Genesis 41:25,

00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:12.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph, now 30 years old,
is standing before the king.

00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:17.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Joseph said to Pharaoh:

00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:20.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same.

00:14:20.213 --> 00:14:24.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

scorched by the east wind,

“‘The true God has caused Pharaoh
to see what He will do.

“‘There are to be seven years
of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.

“‘But seven years of famine
will certainly arise after them,

00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and all the abundance
in the land of Egypt will certainly be forgotten,

“‘and the famine will exhaust the land.

00:15:09.137 --> 00:15:11.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And the previous abundance in the land

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:15.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will not be remembered

“‘for it will be very severe.

“‘The dream was given twice to Pharaoh

has been firmly established by the true God,

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:27.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the true God will soon carry it out.’”

00:15:29.032 --> 00:15:32.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph lays out a detailed strategy

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:34.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with the coming famine.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pharaoh is so pleased
with Joseph’s interpretation

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his sound advice

00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:44.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he installs Joseph as ruler over all Egypt,

00:15:45.048 --> 00:15:47.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second only to himself!

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:52.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eight years later, famine dominates the region.

00:15:52.722 --> 00:15:55.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph’s family suffers too.

00:15:55.767 --> 00:16:00.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob directs his sons
to try to buy food in Egypt.

00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:04.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob’s ten oldest sons leave for Egypt.

00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:08.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, his youngest, Benjamin,
stays safely at home.

00:16:09.823 --> 00:16:14.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ten brothers meet Joseph
and bow down to him,

00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:17.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling Joseph’s dream from years earlier.

00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:20.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph recognizes his brothers,

00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:23.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they don’t recognize him.

00:16:23.837 --> 00:16:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He speaks to them
only in Egyptian through an interpreter

00:16:28.174 --> 00:16:31.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeps his true identity secret.

00:16:32.554 --> 00:16:35.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph now has a decision to make.

00:16:35.974 --> 00:16:40.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he use his authority
to make life hard for his brothers?

00:16:40.645 --> 00:16:43.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he dismiss them indifferently,

00:16:43.147 --> 00:16:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feeling that they don’t deserve his help?

00:16:46.317 --> 00:16:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or will he look for any opening
to reconcile with them?

00:16:51.114 --> 00:16:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he imitate Jehovah’s loyal love?

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you have done?

00:16:58.621 --> 00:17:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph wants to know
if their attitude has changed

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:06.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if they’re still filled with hatred and envy.

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:09.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, he accuses them of being spies,

00:17:09.924 --> 00:17:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling them he’ll keep
their brother Simeon under arrest

00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:16.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they return with Benjamin.

00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:22.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Genesis 42:21-24.

00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:28.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘We are surely being punished
on account of our brother,

00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:30.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because we saw his distress

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘when he begged us to show compassion,

00:17:32.447 --> 00:17:34.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but we did not listen.

00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:37.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why this distress has come upon us.’

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:40.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Reuben answered them:

00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Did I not say to you,

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Do not sin against the child,”

00:17:45.084 --> 00:17:47.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but you would not listen?

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now his blood is certainly being asked back.’

00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But they did not know that Joseph understood,

00:17:54.844 --> 00:17:57.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for there was an interpreter between them.

00:17:57.305 --> 00:18:00.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he turned away from them
and began to weep.

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he returned and spoke to them again,

00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:07.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he took Simeon from them
and bound him before their eyes.”

00:18:09.192 --> 00:18:14.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reuben expresses remorse
over their mistreatment of Joseph.

00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But are Reuben and his brothers
genuinely repentant?

00:18:18.534 --> 00:18:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find out, Joseph demands
that his brothers return to Canaan

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:27.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then bring Benjamin,
their youngest brother, to Egypt.

00:18:28.169 --> 00:18:30.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jacob respond

00:18:30.588 --> 00:18:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the demand that Benjamin
be brought to Egypt?

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:39.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 42:36, 37 answers:

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is I you have bereaved!

00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more,

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you are going to take Benjamin!

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:53.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is upon me that all these things have come!’

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Reuben said to his father:

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You may put to death my own two sons
if I do not bring him back to you.

00:19:00.994 --> 00:19:05.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give him over to my care,
and I will return him to you.’”

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:09.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob is adamant!

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will not allow Benjamin out of his sight.

00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:16.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, by the second year of the famine,

00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:21.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food supplies run out at home
for Jacob and his household.

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jacob now be persuaded
to let Benjamin join his brothers

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:29.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their trek back to Egypt
for more food supplies?

00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:31.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out

00:19:31.357 --> 00:19:37.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reading Genesis 43:8-10, 13, and 14.

00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Judah then urged Israel his father:

00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:43.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Send the boy with me, and let us go on our way

00:19:43.661 --> 00:19:45.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“‘But if we had not delayed,

00:20:01.387 --> 00:20:04.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we could have been there

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Take your brother and go, return to the man.

00:20:22.784 --> 00:20:25.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be bereaved!’”

00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:30.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although earlier
Judah had displayed insensitivity

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:33.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward his father’s favored son, Joseph,

00:20:33.753 --> 00:20:37.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now he’s willing to take full responsibility

00:20:37.298 --> 00:20:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his father’s beloved son Benjamin.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jacob permits his sons to return to Egypt,

00:20:44.055 --> 00:20:46.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing Joseph a large gift.

00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:52.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading Genesis 43:26-30.

00:20:53.606 --> 00:20:56.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Joseph went into the house,

00:20:56.317 --> 00:20:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they brought their gift to him into the house

00:20:58.653 --> 00:21:02.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and prostrated themselves to him to the ground.

00:21:02.198 --> 00:21:05.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How is your aged father
of whom you have spoken?

“Is he still alive?’

00:21:07.578 --> 00:21:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this they said:

“‘Your servant our father is well.

“He is still alive.’

00:21:14.544 --> 00:21:19.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then they bowed down
and prostrated themselves.

00:21:19.048 --> 00:21:22.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he looked up 
and saw Benjamin his brother,

of whom you have spoken to me?’

00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:32.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He added:

00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘May God show you his favor, my son.’

00:21:34.897 --> 00:21:37.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Joseph then hurried out,

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because he was overcome
with emotion for his brother,

00:21:40.528 --> 00:21:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he looked for a place to weep.

00:21:42.613 --> 00:21:47.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he went into a private room
and gave way to tears there.”

00:21:48.953 --> 00:21:52.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph wants to discern
his brothers’ true feelings,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he tests them.

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:56.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:21:56.252 --> 00:22:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph has his servants
fill each of his brothers’ bags with food.

00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:04.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Secretly, he also has his special silver cup

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:06.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
slipped into Benjamin’s bag.

00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:11.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After they all leave
and have traveled a short distance on the road,

00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:14.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph sends his servants after them.

00:22:14.979 --> 00:22:18.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they catch up with them,
the servants demand:

00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why have you stolen
our master’s silver cup?’

00:22:23.696 --> 00:22:28.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph’s brothers
strongly deny any wrongdoing and add:

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you find the cup with any one of us,

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let that person be killed.’

00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:37.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the servants search through all the bags,

00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:40.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they find the cup in Benjamin’s bag!

00:22:40.671 --> 00:22:45.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers show their grief
by ripping their garments apart.

00:22:45.635 --> 00:22:50.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perplexed, they all return
with Benjamin to Joseph’s house.

00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,
having fallen to the ground before Joseph,

00:22:55.603 --> 00:22:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Judah says:

00:22:57.647 --> 00:23:01.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The true God 
has found out the error of your slaves.

00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:05.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now slaves to my master.”

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:09.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph, continuing his test, replies sternly:

00:23:09.242 --> 00:23:12.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘As for the rest of you, return home,

00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:16.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Benjamin must stay here as my slave!’

00:23:16.457 --> 00:23:18.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Judah moans:

00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:21.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I fail to bring Benjamin back,

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:24.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘my father will surely die

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:28.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will have sinned against him forever.’

00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:31.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Judah is unwilling to cause his father

00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:34.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pain of losing another favored son,

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:39.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he volunteers to become
a slave in place of Benjamin.

00:23:40.189 --> 00:23:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read of Joseph’s emotional reaction

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:47.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Genesis 45:1-15:

“At this Joseph could no longer control himself

00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:56.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he cried out:

“No one else stayed with him

“while Joseph
made himself known to his brothers.

00:24:03.296 --> 00:24:06.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he began to weep so loudly

“that the Egyptians heard it
and Pharaoh’s house heard it.

00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:12.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:26:36.574 --> 00:26:40.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accordingly, Jacob, with about 70 of his family,

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:42.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moves down to Egypt.

00:26:42.163 --> 00:26:46.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pharaoh gives them
the land of Goshen to dwell in.

00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:51.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 215 years,
Jacob’s descendants live in Egypt

00:26:51.255 --> 00:26:53.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the day when all three million

00:26:53.841 --> 00:26:57.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or more of them pass
between the walls of the parted Red Sea

00:26:57.344 --> 00:27:00.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and eventually take possession
of the Promised Land.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used Joseph

00:27:03.517 --> 00:27:07.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preserve the line of descent
leading to the Messiah.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can the story of Joseph teach us?

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:14.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what situation he faced,

00:27:14.653 --> 00:27:17.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph showed loyal love to Jehovah.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years,
he was battered by one trial after another,

00:27:21.702 --> 00:27:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he never became resentful.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we may have little control

00:27:26.832 --> 00:27:30.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the trials we face in this imperfect system.

00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:34.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can control our reaction to them.

00:27:35.466 --> 00:27:38.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We refuse to become embittered 
against Jehovah.

00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love Jehovah,

00:27:40.763 --> 00:27:43.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are determined to prove our love

00:27:43.974 --> 00:27:47.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by rejecting any conduct that would hurt him.

00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, when Joseph’s circumstances changed,

00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:54.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he showed loyal love to his family,

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite his brothers’ unjust treatment.

00:27:57.655 --> 00:28:01.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Joseph’s loyal love toward his family

00:28:01.575 --> 00:28:04.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped to fulfill a prophecy!

00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:07.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days
of Joseph’s great-grandfather Abraham,

00:28:07.998 --> 00:28:12.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had set 
the precise time to deliver His people

00:28:12.378 --> 00:28:15.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—exactly 430 years later.

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:19.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Joseph had not shown
loyal love toward his family,

00:28:19.718 --> 00:28:22.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would that prophecy have been fulfilled?

00:28:22.429 --> 00:28:27.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, our loyal love
for our brothers matters to Jehovah.

00:28:28.477 --> 00:28:31.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you are ever hurt by your spiritual brother,

00:28:31.814 --> 00:28:35.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reject the temptation
to spread negative talk about him

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:38.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to hurt him in kind.

00:28:39.321 --> 00:28:42.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do whatever is necessary to restore peace.

00:28:42.366 --> 00:28:46.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,
our brothers are loved by Jehovah.

00:28:46.745 --> 00:28:50.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They deserve our loyal love too!

00:28:50.374 --> 00:28:53.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The finest example of loyal love in this account

00:28:53.794 --> 00:28:55.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Jehovah.

00:28:55.796 --> 00:28:58.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph was abandoned by his family,

00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:01.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
slandered by his employer’s wife,

00:29:01.176 --> 00:29:03.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and finally thrown into prison;

00:29:03.971 --> 00:29:06.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah “continued with Joseph

00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:09.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept showing loyal love to him.”

00:29:09.685 --> 00:29:11.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:14.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw that Joseph remained loyal,

00:29:14.231 --> 00:29:17.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he acted in loyalty toward Joseph.

00:29:17.943 --> 00:29:20.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s treatment of Joseph

00:29:20.404 --> 00:29:24.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also an expression
of loyal love toward the nation of Israel.

00:29:24.867 --> 00:29:28.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By using Joseph to preserve his family,

00:29:28.454 --> 00:29:31.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah preserved the line of the Messiah

00:29:31.665 --> 00:29:35.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ensured that His promise
to deliver the Israelites

00:29:35.252 --> 00:29:38.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was fulfilled right on time.

00:29:38.005 --> 00:29:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that reassuring?

00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:43.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imperfect humans may let you down,

00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:46.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may face ridicule or even slander,

00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you may be treated unjustly.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:53.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you remain loyal,
Jehovah will never abandon you.

00:29:53.687 --> 00:29:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never forgot Joseph,

00:29:55.898 --> 00:30:00.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will not forget
any of His loyal servants today.

00:30:00.361 --> 00:30:02.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stick close to Jehovah,

00:30:02.946 --> 00:30:07.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will continue showing loyal love to you.

How will you feel
when all we came here to do

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is finally completed?

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, we will find a moment to reflect

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:15.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the words of Philippians 2:13.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah energized us

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave each and every one of us
“both the desire

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power to act.”

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:28.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has sharing on this project
affected your life?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started over seven years ago.

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how excited
you’re going to be

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we hear
that the new branch facility at Chelmsford

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been approved by the City Council?

00:00:57.953 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, guess what?

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yesterday afternoon we received the approval.

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whilst the buildings are beautiful,

00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the day,
they are just buildings.

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:40.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The really special part of this project

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been the people;

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:47.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even non-Witnesses saw that something special

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was taking place on our site.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very friendly site to work on.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just how friendly everyone is.

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You walk in, and it just—
I find it mind-blowing.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a negative (sometimes) society,

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you come here,
it just puts a smile on your face.

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A truly unexpected success

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the visitors’ center.

00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we underestimated the appreciation

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:12.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people have

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:14.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for theocratic activities.

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:17.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Visitors from all around the globe witnessed

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the activities of Jehovah for themselves.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is partly why

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m actually studying the Bible
to get baptized,

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:29.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when I came here,
it just hit me somewhere, you know?

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me and Alicia can’t see,

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so everyone has been
so encouraging and thoughtful.

00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really feel like Jehovah is with us
and he’s supported us.

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:46.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really liked the ladies driving tractors.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone wanted to have
a part in the project.

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every single contribution warmed our hearts

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:58.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes our heads too.

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:02.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another beautiful project highlight

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the day-volunteer program.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:07.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The effort and expense brothers and sisters

00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:09.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificed reminded all of us

00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:13.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what a privilege it is
to work for Jehovah.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how about the commuters
who helped on the project?

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:19.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would the BRD family have had

00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:21.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same spirit without our commuters?

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:28.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you just love being a part
of this amazing family?

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were regularly reminded that spirituality

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:37.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is of the utmost importance.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you ever say that a monthly meeting

00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:42.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best one yet?

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lies outside the comfort zone

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the faith zone.

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:51.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t cry because it’s over;

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:54.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smile because it happened.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:59.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your story?

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:02.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The center of all of our stories is Jehovah.

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:05.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one who energized us;

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:08.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is the one who gave us
both the desire

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:10.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power to act.

00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one we can thank

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:14.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the lifelong friendships we have formed,

00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:16.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the training we have received,

00:06:16.396 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the challenges
we have been able to overcome.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember your story.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:26.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, it’s only just beginning.

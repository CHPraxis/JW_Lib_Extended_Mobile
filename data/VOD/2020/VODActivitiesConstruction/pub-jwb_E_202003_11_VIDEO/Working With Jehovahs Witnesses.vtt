WEBVTT

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:04.942 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been working on the project

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:06.569 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
almost 12 months now.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.237 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had a limited knowledge

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:09.363 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:11.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Occasionally, they knock on the door.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.741 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We only see one small part of you

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when you’re coming around the streets

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:16.078 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and you’re knocking on doors.

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.121 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even know they did

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
these sorts of projects.

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Then I’ve learned that they’ve been

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all over the world doing these,
the same sort of thing.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve never been on a site
that’s as well-run as this one.

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:28.757 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The cleanliness of the actual site

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:30.301 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is, you know, impeccable.

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It seems a very, very well-organized site.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:35.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The planning of the whole thing . . .

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:35.598 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:36.891 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
. . . the walkways, the routes in and out

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.434 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—it’s all been exemplary.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:40.269 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s been an experience

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.021 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—a good one, I might add.

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s opened my eyes
to a lot of different ways of working.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I found out
that most of the people on this site

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were volunteers, I was quite amazed.

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very clear that Watchtower

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put so much time into their people

00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of bringing them on,
putting the skills in, 

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making them capable of doing
the job that they wanted to do.

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:07.504 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And that training and that time,

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was just superb to see.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:11.216 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This fellow sitting next to me, 

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:12.551 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when I explained to him, you know,

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that volunteers were working here,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t believe me.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everyone we speak to,
there’s just no chance they would believe us

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to what we see and what we experience
—which has been good.

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:23.479 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got ladies driving

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.647 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
diggers and big dumpers.

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not very often you see that.

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Construction is still
a male-dominated environment,

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to actually come on-site
and see the number of women

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are actually operating
the plant and actually involved

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the cold-face construction,
it’s fantastic.

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It proves that they’re able to do
as good a job and—walking around this site

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I’m going to be honest with you)
—probably a better job in many instances.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how everyone

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:51.966 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is just really nice

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.342 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and just seems so relaxed

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are just genuinely
really, really, nice people.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always got a “Hello.”

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always got a “Goodbye.”

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always were asked how you were doing.

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.017 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When you go back home, you feel different.

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:04.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have that feeling

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.814 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—that stress—on top of you.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:08.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We came here the first time,

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was almost
(to my mind) like a film set.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone seemed happy all the time,

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it didn’t seem possible
that it could happen.

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, and it’s just continued for the last

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what?—eight months, nine months
since I have been here.

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s always happy,
and no one can fake that.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s great to see people that are
just really positive about everything,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which in a sometimes negative society

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you pick up the papers
and look at the news—

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:34.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just when you come here
—it’s just—it puts a smile on your face.

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:35.759 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s just been a warmer,

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.094 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
friendlier experience.

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:38.345 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
All the health and safety

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the briefings—they’re all still done.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you build so fast
and so accurately with such quality, though?

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what’s blown our minds.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the people on-site don’t have
the skills when they first come here,

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re doing work as good

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as some of our guys who’ve probably
been employed six or seven years.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The communication has been fantastic.

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a two-way conversation
when problems arise;

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not always a fight over money.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just working with each other.

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s not an argument over everything.

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If something is not right,
you work together to get over the problem.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.084 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To see everyone here together

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all striving for the same goal is fantastic.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think what’s made it great for us,
working with Watchtower,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that everything they want to do,
they want to do it right.

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:20.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they do everything
with passion and energy,

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s something
that we like to do ourselves, as well.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve built The Gherkin in the city;
I’ve built Wembley Stadium

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—big projects, big status—

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:33.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve pretty much seen the cusp
of other professionals out there.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would not know the difference.

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:38.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And being volunteer
and nonprofit (I would say),

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s been absolutely
incredible to see, really.

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:48.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve learned how to work together
with other people on-site;

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve learned how to work with people
that haven’t been in construction before.

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:56.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just keeping it honest and straightforward
sort of solves a lot of problems.

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wish it would be like
that everywhere else,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, you know, it’s unheard of, really.

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve learned more on this site
than we’ve learned on any site

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about working with each other,
probably in 23 years.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had an enjoyable experience
working with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:11.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If there was a chance

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:12.689 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to come up with another project,

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:13.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d definitely be more than willing

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:15.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to want to get involved.

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:18.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish all sites could be like this
because my life would be a lot easier.

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to get people to come to this site;

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:23.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there would be a definite difference

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way people
perceive Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:28.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s certainly opened and broadened my mind

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what Jehovah’s Witnesses do.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s changed my opinion
of your organization most

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that you do exactly what you preach,
and I mean exactly: 

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re friendly, you’re forthright,
you’re very truthful.

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve never been
on any other project like this,

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not at all.

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:52.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wish
all construction sites were like that.

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be a nicer place to live and work.

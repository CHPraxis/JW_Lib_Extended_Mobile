I’ve got this grudge.
I’m holding it in.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s so heavy;
it pulls me down.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I could
turn this around.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand
the need to forgive,

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not easy
if it’s not my fault.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These thoughts
bring forgiveness to a halt.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s right about now
that I have to pray.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw what happened;
he knows my pain.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all
he gives me

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strength to let it go.

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I can’t do this
on my own.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:23.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help me to reflect
The way he forgives, the way he forgets.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:39.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive freely.

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trying my best
to let it all go,

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times,
it comes back to mind.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I could put
all this behind.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realize
that I can’t hold on.

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgiveness means
you don’t bring it back up.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This only gets me
in a rut.

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s right about now
that I have to pray.

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw what happened;
he knows my pain.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:35.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all
he gives me

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strength to let it go.

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I can’t do this
on my own.

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

I pray, “Jehovah, please help me;
Help me forgive freely.”

00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:23.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive freely.
Forgive freely.

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:33.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive freely.
Forgive freely.

the word of truth

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About Jehovah
and a world that is new,

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love grew in my heart
right up to this day.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I know this world
wants to pull me away.

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:48.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot lose sight.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

So we have to choose
where we will stand:

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A life built on rock
or one built on sand.

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This world around us
wants us to believe

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will stand forever,
so live and be free.

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know the truth,

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What the Kingdom will do.

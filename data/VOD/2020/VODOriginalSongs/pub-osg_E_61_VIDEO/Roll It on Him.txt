00:00:19 When I called yesterday, I could tell you’d lost your way.
00:00:26 Be assured you are loved By our God up above.
00:00:36 So do not fear. When you’re broken, he is near.
00:00:49 Trust in Jehovah; don’t give in. Just let it go; roll it on him.
00:00:56 You’re not alone; you can pray. He hears your words; he feels your pain.
00:01:06 Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.
00:01:14 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:01:23 Raise your eyes up and see; The new world is in our reach—
00:01:30 No more tears, only love Through the gift of God’s dear Son.
00:01:40 But until then, We can endure down to the end
00:01:52 If we trust in Jehovah; don’t give in. Just let it go; roll it on him.
00:02:00 We’re not alone; we can pray. He hears our words; he feels our pain.
00:02:09 Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.
00:02:19 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:03:00 Trust in Jehovah; don’t give in. Just let it go; roll it on him.
00:03:08 We’re not alone; we can pray. He hears our words; he feels our pain.
00:03:17 Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.
00:03:26 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:03:34 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.

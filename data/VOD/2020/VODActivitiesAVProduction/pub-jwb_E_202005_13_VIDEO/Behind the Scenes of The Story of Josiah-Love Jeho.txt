00:00:12 Where do you begin an important project
00:00:14 like The Story of Josiah: Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad?
00:00:18 You begin with prayerful consideration.
00:00:22 It’s a serious responsibility —part of being loyal to Jehovah and his Word.
00:00:28 Therefore, many hours of careful research goes into the first step:
00:00:31 writing a script.
00:00:34 The script is then visualized through a step called storyboarding.
00:00:43 But it’s not just the script and storyboarding
00:00:45 that requires attention to accuracy.
00:00:48 Costumes must be thoroughly researched so that their components,
00:00:52 styles, colors, and even the types of fabric
00:00:55 appear as historically accurate as possible.
00:01:01 The production must also accurately depict the times
00:01:04 being represented while making the best use of donated funds.
00:01:08 How can this be done?
00:01:10 For The Story of Josiah,
00:01:12 the solution was to film at Bethel locations,
00:01:14 such as the studio spaces at Mount Ebo.
00:01:19 Set construction began early in 2018.
00:01:23 The production team designed and built three flexible sets
00:01:26 so that with easy prop adjustments,
00:01:29 they could be in multiple locations.
00:01:34 Even the exterior Jerusalem city scenes
00:01:36 were filmed indoors.
00:01:46 Many brothers and sisters from local congregations
00:01:49 served as extras for the crowd scenes.
00:01:53 With an eye to Biblical and historical accuracy,
00:01:55 the makeup team transformed the actors
00:01:58 into characters from King Josiah’s time.
00:02:02 There were so many details to get right.
00:02:31 For a large portion of the drama, filming in front of a green screen
00:02:34 enabled the visual effects team to construct accurate environments digitally.
00:02:42 Many layers of character action, called plates, were assembled
00:02:45 with digital environments to produce complex visuals.
00:03:14 For the closing festival scene,
00:03:16 which required 14,000 Israelites
00:03:20 and many sheep,
00:03:22 3D models were made and duplicated to simulate the large crowd.
00:03:31 In July 2018, the production packed up
00:03:34 and moved to an outdoor location
00:03:37 at Watchtower Farms in Wallkill, New York.
00:03:42 And action!
00:03:56 In August, the last scene was filmed
00:03:59 back at the Mount Ebo studio.
00:04:02 After 45 days of filming
00:04:04 and with over 4 terabytes of footage captured,
00:04:07 the team had finished production.
00:04:10 The project moved to the editing facilities at Patterson, New York.
00:04:18 But what more could be done so that the account portrayed
00:04:21 could touch our hearts?
00:04:24 A colorist applied a look to the overall film
00:04:27 to enhance the picture’s quality and mood.
00:04:30 You have to get better.
00:04:31 I’m afraid of being alone.
00:04:33 Additional sound effects, such as footsteps
00:04:36 and the sound of dry grass being rustled,
00:04:39 were recorded to make the on-screen action more natural and compelling.
00:04:44 Finally, the musical soundtrack was composed,
00:04:46 recorded, and added to the movie to enhance the appeal to our hearts.
00:04:53 The work on The Story of Josiah: Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad
00:04:57 was done to strengthen Jehovah’s people worldwide.
00:05:02 You’re not alone.
00:05:03 Jehovah is with you.
00:05:07 This powerful story also assists parents as they teach their children
00:05:11 the power of God’s Word and promise.
00:05:16 “These words that I am commanding you today
00:05:18 “must be on your heart,
00:05:21 “and you must inculcate them in your sons
00:05:23 “and speak of them when you sit in your house
00:05:26 “and when you walk on the road
00:05:28 and when you lie down and when you get up.”
00:05:32 “So that it may always go well with you
00:05:34 “and your sons after you,
00:05:37 “because you are doing what is good
00:05:40 and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”
00:05:45 The Story of Josiah has proven to be yet another example
00:05:49 of how Jehovah continues to provide abundant spiritual food and support
00:05:54 for his people worldwide.

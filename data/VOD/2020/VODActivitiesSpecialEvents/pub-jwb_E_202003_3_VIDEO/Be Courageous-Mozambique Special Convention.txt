00:00:17 The Mozambique special convention
00:00:19 is truly outstanding
00:00:22 for so many different reasons.
00:00:23 One thing that has made this convention unique
00:00:26 is that we have so many courageous brothers
00:00:28 who have been in prison for their faith
00:00:31 from Angola, Korea, Malawi, Zimbabwe,
00:00:34 and from some of the countries in Europe
00:00:36 and who had to really stand up and set an example.
00:00:40 And to have them all here
00:00:41 with our courageous
00:00:42 Mozambican brothers
00:00:43 has made this
00:00:45  convention so special.
00:00:47 It is very encouraging
00:00:49 to be at this special convention.
00:00:50 We have spent ten years
00:00:52 in the “reeducation camps”
00:00:53 along with our brothers from Malawi, and we were at the same camp.
00:00:57 And today we are together at this special convention.
00:01:00 It’s very encouraging.
00:01:03 In 1990, I was judged and condemned
00:01:05 to 15 months of prison in Paris.
00:01:07 We were about 100 brothers in prison.
00:01:10 They tried to shame us,
00:01:12 but thanks to Jehovah, we had courage.
00:01:14 And today this beautiful convention
00:01:17 fills us with even more courage.
00:01:20 I was one of the brothers serving
00:01:22 as a bicycle courier during the ban,
00:01:24 delivering literature long distances.
00:01:26 It was difficult work because the police were searching for us.
00:01:30 Jehovah blessed us with courage, giving us a heart without fear.
00:01:37 Because of our Christian neutrality,
00:01:39 we were in prison.
00:01:40 Although it was a difficult time,
00:01:42 Jehovah gave us courage to endure,
00:01:45 and now we are here together.
00:01:47 We really thank Jehovah for that.
00:01:53 I was arrested and sentenced
00:01:55 to six years in prison.
00:01:57 Despite all these difficulties,
00:01:59 today I feel very happy.
00:02:01 I feel very encouraged.
00:02:09 At this convention, we released
00:02:11 the Greek Scriptures  in Tshwa and Sena.
00:02:20 Thank you very much, Jehovah,
00:02:22 for this wonderful provision.
00:02:24 I will surely use it
00:02:27 while speaking about
00:02:28 Jehovah’s name in Tshwa.
00:02:31 We are so happy to have
00:02:33 this Bible in the Tshwa language.
00:02:35 It’s easy to read, and it will improve our family worship.
00:02:39 Those were the first two local languages
00:02:42 in Mozambique to receive any part of the New World Translation.
00:02:45 So it was a very exciting day!
00:02:52 This convention was tied
00:02:54 in to 18 locations in Mozambique.
00:02:57 A total of 1,685 were baptized.
00:03:05 I have faith in Jehovah
00:03:07 and want to have
00:03:08 a close relationship with him.
00:03:11 Many have commented on the fact that among the 981
00:03:15 who were baptized in Maputo, there were many young ones.
00:03:18 And it just shows that the families here in Mozambique
00:03:21 are working very hard with their young ones
00:03:24 to help them to know Jehovah and love Jehovah
00:03:27 and to know what it means to be courageous.
00:03:32 To organize
00:03:33 a special convention
00:03:34 in Africa
00:03:35 requires a lot of work and a lot of planning.
00:03:40 But you can truly see the blessing of Jehovah here
00:03:43 because everything has gone so beautifully
00:03:46 and the delegates are so happy!
00:03:49 You can really feel that Jehovah’s spirit is with us.
00:03:59 Before the work
00:04:00 was banned in Mozambique,
00:04:02 we used to sing to Jehovah.
00:04:04 At the camps, we continued to sing joyfully.
00:04:09 Now with the special convention,
00:04:11 we continue to sing to our delegates.
00:04:16 Many of the delegates commented that their favorite part
00:04:19 of the convention was going out in the ministry with the local brothers.
00:04:24 Even though the brothers may have very limited resources,
00:04:27 they showed them tremendous hospitality;
00:04:30 it made a huge impression.
00:04:32 Some of the delegates even said that when they go back,
00:04:35 this is going to have a life-changing effect on them.
00:04:44 We want to assure
00:04:45 these dear brothers and sisters
00:04:47 that the Governing Body loves them.
00:04:50 But greater than that, Jehovah God knows about them;
00:04:53 he loves them; he’s supporting them.

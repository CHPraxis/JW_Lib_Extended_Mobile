00:00:04 The modern-day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Greece
00:00:07 includes a long record of legal battles
00:00:09 to establish the freedom to preach the good news.
00:00:15 However, today, for the most part, opposition has subsided
00:00:18 and the Greece branch continues to spearhead
00:00:21 the preaching work in Cyprus and in Greece.
00:00:25 What led up to this branch dedication?
00:00:28 After a ten-year search for a suitable site
00:00:30 for the new branch and with help
00:00:33 from the Worldwide Design/Construction Department,
00:00:35 a location was found.
00:00:38 The new branch office is located on the outskirts of Athens,
00:00:41 close to the busy port of Piraeus.
00:00:45 What are the new offices like?
00:00:48 Let’s start with the translation office,
00:00:50 which was dedicated in October 2016.
00:00:54 The translation office is located on the second floor of this building
00:00:58 just above the dotted line.
00:01:01 Most members of the translation team live in the apartments above the offices.
00:01:06 Here, the brothers translate into Greek,
00:01:09 Greek Sign Language, and two Romany languages.
00:01:14 The new branch office is located
00:01:16 about three miles from the translation office.
00:01:20 It occupies one half of this new building.
00:01:25 A commercial firm put up the building’s structure,
00:01:28 and a local design construction team customized
00:01:31 the inside for our needs.
00:01:34 Here is a look at the new branch.
00:01:36 Here is the lobby.
00:01:39 Here we see the rooms,
00:01:43 some of the offices,
00:01:48 and the dining room.
00:01:51 The dedication of the beautiful new branch
00:01:54 was scheduled for Saturday, November 17, 2018.
00:01:58 But things did not go as planned.
00:02:01 As Jamie and I left for the airport on Thursday morning,
00:02:05 some light snow was expected,
00:02:06 so we arrived early.
00:02:09 However, much more snow fell
00:02:11 than was forecast.
00:02:13 Our flight was delayed, and eventually it was canceled.
00:02:17 So after spending 14 hours at Newark airport,
00:02:21 we returned to Warwick.
00:02:24 We had to wait until the next evening to catch a flight.
00:02:28 The next day, the brothers in Greece were gathering in the Bethel dining room
00:02:32 for the branch dedication,
00:02:34 but our late departure meant that we would not arrive
00:02:38 in time for the program.
00:02:40 Kindly, the Teaching Committee
00:02:42 adjusted the schedule so that the dedication talk could be
00:02:45 presented on Sunday.
00:02:47 But what took place in Greece
00:02:49 when all the brothers found out that we wouldn’t make it in time
00:02:53 for the dedication talk on Saturday?
00:02:55 I said to Brother Cook: “You know, Brother Cook,
00:02:58 if there is anything you need help with, please let me know.”
00:03:06 I didn’t expect this.
00:03:11 Brother LaFranca gave an encouraging service talk
00:03:14 that enhanced the weekend program.
00:03:16 We arrived at the branch
00:03:18 late Saturday afternoon in time to greet the brothers there.
00:03:26 On Sunday morning, we traveled to the Assembly Hall
00:03:29 along with 116 delegates
00:03:31 from 16 countries.
00:03:33 The attendance at the Assembly Hall was 1,680.
00:03:38 All the congregations in Greece and Cyprus
00:03:41 were either tied in or watched the recorded program,
00:03:45 making the total attendance 27,718.
00:03:52 Do you desire to dedicate this branch office
00:03:54 to Jehovah God to be used
00:03:57 exclusively for his praise and glory
00:04:00 and to promote his pure worship
00:04:03 in your branch territory?
00:04:14 After the program, in Greek style,
00:04:17 all rejoiced in what Jehovah had done.
00:04:22 The 84 Bethelites,
00:04:23 44 commuters,
00:04:26 and all in attendance at the Assembly Hall,
00:04:28 enthusiastically sent their love and greetings
00:04:32 to the Governing Body and the Bethel family
00:04:35 in the United States.

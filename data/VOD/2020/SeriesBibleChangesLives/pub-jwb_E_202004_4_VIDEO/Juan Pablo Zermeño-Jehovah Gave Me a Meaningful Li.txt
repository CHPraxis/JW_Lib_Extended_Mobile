00:00:06 When you’re little, you just want to be happy.
00:00:16 But sadly, my father had a problem with alcohol,
00:00:28 and no child wants to live through that.
00:00:32 One day, my family from the United States came to visit us.
00:00:38 They looked so happy!
00:00:41 The way they talked, it was as though they only had fun
00:00:45 —a good life
00:00:46 with no economic problems.
00:00:50 I was shocked.
00:00:52 I asked myself, ‘How can we live
00:00:54 in such poverty while their life is so great?’
00:00:57 That was the life I wanted for my family.
00:01:09 So when I was nine years old,
00:01:16 I left my mother and the rest of my family
00:01:18 to cross the border into the United States.
00:01:22 I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood.
00:01:26 So I joined a local gym to learn how to defend myself.
00:01:33 The trainer, Leo, was like a father to me.
00:01:37 He always tried to give us good advice.
00:01:41 Raymond was part of the boxing team.
00:01:45 He was a good friend.
00:01:47 We got along really well.
00:01:49 He respected me, and he looked after me.
00:01:53 After several years of being around Raymond
00:01:56 and the other members of the team, I felt really comfortable.
00:02:00 To some extent, I admired him
00:02:02 because I could see that he was really doing well,
00:02:06 because Raymond was selling drugs.
00:02:08 I knew that it wasn’t right.
00:02:11 But in time,
00:02:13 I began to sell drugs as well.
00:02:16 Raymond was in a drug deal gone wrong,
00:02:21 and he was murdered.
00:02:25 I said to myself, ‘This could happen to me too.’
00:02:31 It had been six years since I had seen my mom and my siblings.
00:02:46 My mother was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:52 It helped her to cope with a lot of suffering.
00:02:55 It brought her peace.
00:02:57 She was so happy.
00:03:02 I began to realize that this was what I really needed.
00:03:06 I also thought about my friends at the gym.
00:03:08 I wanted them to understand why life was so hard for all of us,
00:03:13 so I returned to the United States.
00:03:17 But they weren’t interested.
00:03:20 My trainer, Leo, told me that I didn’t need to sell drugs anymore;
00:03:25 he could make me a professional boxer,
00:03:28 and I could help out my family in that way.
00:03:30 He even gave me the nickname The Bible Boy.
00:03:43 But I realized that that was just a temporary solution.
00:03:47 What I was learning was going to help me forever.
00:03:50 I was determined to serve Jehovah.
00:03:54 I returned to Mexico.
00:03:56 I started to study the Bible and take it seriously.
00:03:59 I began to view Jehovah as my Father
00:04:02 because he helped me to find real relief from my pain,
00:04:06 to have peace—a tranquility that makes you feel
00:04:09 accepted, loved, and wanted.
00:04:15 I have enjoyed an incredible life serving Jehovah.
00:04:23 Decades later, my father was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:27 Jehovah has been so kind to me,
00:04:29 my family, and my siblings.
00:04:33 Truly, I have no way to repay Jehovah for the life he’s given me.
00:04:39 I’ve had so many blessings in my life: a wonderful wife
00:04:44 and great friends,
00:04:46 including those that I serve
00:04:47 alongside of in Bethel.
00:04:49 I’m not on my own anymore.
00:04:53 Jehovah has given me a life full of real meaning, purpose,
00:04:58 and so much happiness.

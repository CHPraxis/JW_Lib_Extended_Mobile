00:00:05 A teacher should always help his or her student
00:00:08 to develop love for Jehovah.
00:00:12 That’s the best foundation to build on.
00:00:16 For me, it’s important that they see Jehovah
00:00:19 as a real Person.
00:00:21 In order to help them build a good foundation, they need to know
00:00:25 that Jehovah gave us the Bible so that we can receive his guidance
00:00:29 for the future and for eternity.
00:00:33 I’m so thankful for my Bible teacher.
00:00:36 She always helped me see Jehovah’s point of view
00:00:39 on things from the Bible.
00:00:43 I’ll never stop thanking Jehovah
00:00:45 for what he’s done for me.
00:00:47 He drew me to the truth.
00:00:49 He gave me a teacher that didn’t just teach me about the Bible,
00:00:53 but by his example, the brother taught me
00:00:55 how to really be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:59 When I started studying,
00:01:01 my parents told me that they didn’t consider me their daughter anymore.
00:01:08 During the study, my teacher helped
00:01:10 me see from the Bible that Jehovah had a lot of really good things in store for me.
00:01:23 My environment was very hostile before.
00:01:28 My problem was that my wife and I argued a lot,
00:01:31 and I had a bad temper.
00:01:35 The brother’s advice really helped us to keep calm when we had problems.
00:01:43 When a person starts getting to know Jehovah and they learn
00:01:47 and apply Bible truths in their lives,
00:01:50 the people who were their friends before are going to disappear.
00:01:55 We need to give them that friendship they’re losing.
00:02:02 We’ve had to make some sacrifices for our students.
00:02:06 But when we think about the blessings,
00:02:08 we can barely remember the sacrifices.
00:02:12 I worked full-time,
00:02:16 but I had to adapt to the student’s needs,
00:02:18 not the other way around.
00:02:20 Sometimes I’d be up at six o’clock in the morning
00:02:23 conducting a Bible study.
00:02:25 Sometimes things come up, and you can’t make it.
00:02:28 But the study should still happen.
00:02:31 Another brother can study with them if we’re not going to be there.
00:02:35 When someone starts studying, it can feel like a lot.
00:02:38 The Bible itself has 66 books.
00:02:42 So for example, you can suggest that the student start reading
00:02:46 a few verses every day
00:02:48 and then add a little more every week.
00:02:50 So that is how we see them progress.
00:02:53 You get to see them practice what they’re learning
00:02:56 —really following the Bible’s counsel in their lives.
00:03:00 We don’t just conduct a study,
00:03:02 see them progress, get baptized,
00:03:04 and then say, “OK, see you later.”
00:03:06 It doesn’t work like that. They become part of our life.
00:03:12 He’s been my friend since before I got baptized.
00:03:15 It’s been about 28 years now.
00:03:18 Years ago, my former student Abel had a really difficult time.
00:03:22 His wife got sick.
00:03:25 Although we were far away when we heard about it,
00:03:28 we kept in touch with him.
00:03:32 “Thank you, Livingston family,
00:03:34 “for calling Jessica during these hard times.
00:03:39 It’s very encouraging to us.”
00:03:41 “I know that you love us, and we also love you very much.
00:03:46 “You are an example in true worship for us.
00:03:50 May Jehovah continue caring for you and blessing you.”
00:04:02 I got baptized 34 years ago
00:04:04 and have been pioneering for 33 years.
00:04:09 My Bible teacher was Schera.
00:04:12 She was diagnosed with cancer.
00:04:15 When I got sick,  Jehovah used Mercedes to help me.
00:04:21 After all this time, since I helped
00:04:24 her learn the truth, now she comforts me.
00:04:28 It’s a father-son relationship.
00:04:31 At some point,
00:04:33 maybe this student will help me.
00:04:35 And we can say that ‘we are good-for-nothing slaves,
00:04:38 and we have done what we ought to have done.’
00:04:41 And they keep loving and serving Jehovah.
00:04:44 What’s better than that?

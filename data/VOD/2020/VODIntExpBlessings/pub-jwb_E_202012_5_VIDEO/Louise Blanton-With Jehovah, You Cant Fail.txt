00:00:03 My family started studying with Witnesses in New Jersey.
00:00:08 My parents had been very diligent in helping us to appreciate
00:00:12 not only Bible principles
00:00:14 but also characters in the Bible
00:00:17 who could be a role model for us.
00:00:20 It helped us to know that Jehovah cared
00:00:24 not only for adult publishers
00:00:27 but also for the children
00:00:29 that were serving him.
00:00:33 When you went out in the ministry,
00:00:35 it became such a common thing
00:00:39 —the police would come and pick you up.
00:00:41 If they couldn’t track down the parents, they would put the children in jail,
00:00:46 knowing that eventually the parents would have to come looking for them.
00:00:51 The police would use scare tactics.
00:00:54 They’d say: “There are rats in the cell.
00:00:58 Is that where you want to be?”
00:01:00 —anything to make you fearful,
00:01:04 to intimidate you to tell them where your parents were.
00:01:08 They’d put us in the jail,
00:01:10 and in order to build our faith, we would sing.
00:01:14 We didn’t have Kingdom melodies back then,
00:01:17 so we used to make up songs,
00:01:20 and that would keep us focused
00:01:23 on what we were doing there.
00:01:27 After I reached the age of 18,
00:01:29 my parents were agreeable to my accepting an assignment.
00:01:33 And in those years,
00:01:35 because of the racial issue in the south,
00:01:40 there were so many areas in the south
00:01:44 where they didn’t have Kingdom Halls
00:01:46 that the colored could attend.
00:01:49 So if you were free  and you would accept an assignment,
00:01:54 the Society usually sent you to the south.
00:01:57 My parents were both born in the south,
00:02:01 so they were able to tell us what to expect
00:02:06 to keep the culture shock from being so great.
00:02:10 I was assigned to pioneer in Andalusia, Alabama.
00:02:15 Based on all of the matters that pertain
00:02:20 to integration and segregation,
00:02:22 this was a hotbed
00:02:25 for testing those issues.
00:02:29 And so I was concerned
00:02:32 about whether I had the fiber
00:02:35 to work under those circumstances.
00:02:41 The field was wide open.
00:02:43 There were so many in the area
00:02:45 that had no knowledge of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:02:49 and were very receptive to the message.
00:02:52 That part of our ministry was very rewarding.
00:02:57 We had some very strong
00:03:01 and helpful brothers
00:03:04 that Jehovah was using
00:03:07 to get his people
00:03:12 —no matter what color—
00:03:14 to appreciate Him and his purpose.
00:03:19 When you focused on these things
00:03:21 —the suggestions and the ideas—
00:03:23 the brothers would help you to appreciate
00:03:26 how to deal with the issues.
00:03:28 They taught us, for one thing,
00:03:31 that the whole purpose of the Ku Klux Klan
00:03:34 is to intimidate.
00:03:37 They feel that if they frighten you enough,
00:03:40 you will leave.
00:03:43 Satan has always used
00:03:45 methods to try to intimidate.
00:03:48 But we would make it a practice to stay, to hold our place.
00:03:52 When we were in street work, we’d stay right there.
00:03:56 And of course, as they passed,
00:03:59 they had their remarks to make,
00:04:01 but we just stood there.
00:04:03 When I think back on my youth,
00:04:07 there isn’t anything that I was able to participate in
00:04:11 that I came to regret.
00:04:13 There were always blessings that went along with it.
00:04:16 If you make yourself available,
00:04:18 Jehovah will use you.
00:04:22 Jehovah is always there as a support.
00:04:26 There isn’t anything that he directs his organization to do
00:04:32 that doesn’t receive his support.
00:04:35 So if we are challenged with a new assignment
00:04:39 or if we feel inadequate about it,
00:04:43 if we look to Jehovah
00:04:46 —with Jehovah, you can’t fail.

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were serving in a small town in Alberta,

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we began having children.

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we moved to Craig we had four children.

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after living here,
we now have nine children.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:23.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were given this trust,
and so as a parent,

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to put the Kingdom first;

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to set a good example;
you need to be at the meetings;

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to be regular in field service.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really believed
that we needed to love Jehovah first

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to be
a good example for our children.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They helped us see that what would make
us happy were spiritual things.

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents, more in action than in words,

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught us to seek first the Kingdom.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With nine kids,
it’s always going to be hectic.

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have extra children;
you have more excuses, perhaps.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having nine children
is a challenge in a million ways.

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, she had moments where she’d sit

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in her rocking chair
and just look <i>so</i><i> </i><i> </i>exhausted.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember one time
when it was time to go to the meeting,

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was so exhausted.

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought of Isaiah 40,
where Jehovah says

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “those hoping
in Jehovah will regain power.”

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I figured that Jehovah wants me to do it.

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to make me
strong enough to do this.

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I prayed, and I got ready.

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:37.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a scramble.

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Hebrews, we see the encouragement

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never forsake “our meeting together.”

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad always spoke of that.

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:55.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a time
that we had to travel in the wintertime,

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe up to two hours to get to the meeting.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d come back to your home late at night,

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, with all these kids
that are worn out—and yourself too.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing the importance
that they placed on the meetings,

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to see
that you never take meetings for granted.

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:19.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents always instilled in us consistency

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:23.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in field service just like the meetings.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just what we did.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That wasn’t questioned.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got up on Saturday morning,

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:33.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we got ourselves
out the door and in service.

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:37.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t simply
just be a backseat ornament.

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that we were there to give a witness.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From an early age,
we were really following the example

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our parents in showing interest in people.

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So because of that,
we enjoyed being in the ministry.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gave me a sense of purpose.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had people to go visit in service.

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to know what I was going to talk
to them about and have a plan.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In field service, we would often take breaks

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sake of the children and ourselves.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was important to have our children

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoy field service—not push them hard

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be too rigid, and so forth.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:23.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think about Proverbs 22:6
in the Byington translation

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:28.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says to “give a boy
the start his course requires.”

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did that by putting the spiritual things

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the material things.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us
to be the best parents we could be.

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:44.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We failed at times, but I always knew
that Jehovah was the best Parent.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:49.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we could teach them to love Him,
then he would take over.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we as a family were successful

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we did have Jehovah in our lives.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:57.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All our children

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing very well in the truth.

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:02.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we’re very happy about that,

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure it makes Jehovah happy.

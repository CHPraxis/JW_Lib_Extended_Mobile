00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.483 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed associating

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:05.901 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Later, I also started to study the Bible.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I had to make

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:11.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drastic changes in my life,

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my job prevented me from doing so.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.872 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So I asked myself,

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:20.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘What would I like to do with my life?’

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began studying
the Bible again with the couple

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.882 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and one month later

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
started attending meetings regularly.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:33.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since our parents had stopped studying,

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only three of us went to the meetings.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.477 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can do a lot with you.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.146 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah could, you know,

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your whole perspective can change.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew if I applied what I learned,

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would not let me down.

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the Bible daily and I pray.

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:00.039 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with Jehovah

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.041 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has gotten stronger.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I pray now,

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it feels like I’m talking to my close Friend.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.047 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Going out in service more—

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:09.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think it really helped me

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:11.342 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to draw closer to Jehovah

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make the Kingdom feel real to me.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s why I wanted to get baptized.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:20.559 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What a great pleasure it was for me

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when four months later

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get baptized!

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:28.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me so happy.

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today is a very, very special day for me,

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because today I’m getting baptized.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the regional convention, August 9, 2014,

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.710 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was a beautiful day.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.388 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I think about my three children

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who got baptized today,

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel my heart is full of joy,

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really thank Jehovah!

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it’s not a day I don’t go thank Jehovah

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking me out of the darkness.

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.991 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
If we are determined to be loyal to Jehovah

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.535 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we have the courage to remain chaste, 

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we won’t have any regrets.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:26.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To know that you have a heavenly Father

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cares about you

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that was the best feeling on earth.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often think:
‘God, is it true? Is it real?

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:42.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really deserve to have
all these blessings?’

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:47.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these blessings have helped me to see

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this life provides
true satisfaction and true happiness.

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:55.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The important quality

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:58.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has taught me is love.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:00.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that love from my family,

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah, and from my friends.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:06.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that it’s OK to love people,

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what you are supposed to do.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:10.961 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Working closely with Jehovah,

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really feel part of his family.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:16.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When you give your faith to Jehovah,

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:18.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you’re giving your life to him.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s permitted these things
to come upon me;

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:23.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he protected me.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:28.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meditate and think

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:31.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what Jehovah
has done for me and Lei Lei,

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to be afraid.

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is my “secure refuge,”

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because life may change,
but Jehovah does not change.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Choosing to serve Jehovah

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:47.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best decision I have made in my life.

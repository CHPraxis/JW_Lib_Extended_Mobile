I’m so happy to welcome today

00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a very dear friend of mine,

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert P. Johnson.

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:10.293 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
R. P., welcome to the program.

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:11.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Mark.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciate being here.

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’re here, R.P.,

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are a wonderful example

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of someone who’s had a life

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:23.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filled with blessings in Jehovah’s service.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:24.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I know that your family
goes way back in the truth.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:31.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I understand
that your great grandfather

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learned the truth in Brother Russell’s time,
even before 1914.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right!

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means
you’re a fourth-generation Witness.

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, like so many
who are watching our program,

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were a little boy growing up
in a congregation of Jehovah’s people.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did you come
to the decision that you wanted

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:54.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life to serve Jehovah
and then get baptized?

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:59.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Mark, thinking back, I can identify

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least two
outstanding influences in my life.

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first was my parents.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having that heritage in the truth helped me.

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just an average kid in my early years.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:19.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the parents instilled in me a desire 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to please Jehovah
and make it my life to do that.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They set goals before me.

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They taught me the truth.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned enough from them to be able

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a dedication to Jehovah God 

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:35.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have a close relationship with him.

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:40.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so early on, that’s what I did.

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:43.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that evening after supper

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my bedroom 

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
praying to Jehovah to accept my dedication.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The date was May 25, 1949.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 11 years old at the time.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told my parents, and they were happy,

00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:04.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they just wanted me
to wait longer to make sure 

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:08.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially how I
would handle the teenage years

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so on, so I waited.

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so then when did the moment
come for you to finally get baptized?

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:20.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was at the 1953 international convention

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Yankee Stadium in New York

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on July 22, 1953, when I was baptized.

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, I remember
that like it was yesterday.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came up out of the water,

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah that finally,

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:40.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!”

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also, like a child, added,

00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:46.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can bring the end anytime now.”

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:52.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you mentioned your parents,
the good influence they had on you,

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but was there another influence
on you that helped you?

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:57.393 --> 00:03:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the 1953 convention,
Brother Knorr had identified

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be a special program

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:07.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for training people in the truth.

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:10.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from the congregation,
there was a brother

00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:13.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the anointed named Charles Richardson,

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father asked Brother Richardson

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:20.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to train me in this training program.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Richardson

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a mentor to me
for the next five years of my life.

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, he helped me

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
view the ministry as an opportunity

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help people develop
a relationship with Jehovah 

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:39.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, therefore, to reach out to them

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in teaching them the truth
—the doctrinal truth—

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to help them to see
that Jehovah is a real person.

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:50.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he helped me to enjoy the ministry.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what has kept me happy

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:56.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service down to this day.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just from your expressions
and what you talked about with me before,

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could see that this Brother Richardson

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:06.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a tremendous impact on your life.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think, R.P., it really made you

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
want to be a trainer of other people 

00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:14.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s how I first met you, right?

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:16.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.
Right.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were the brother
assigned to be my trainer

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:20.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I came to the Service Department.

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:21.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that fondly.

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:24.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know that I’m not the only one.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, you’ve really spent
your whole life training other people.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s been a privilege.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was trained;
I was helped along the way.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was nobody special, but Jehovah 

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has extended undeserved kindness to me 

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:43.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made all these things possible.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no excuse
for me not passing along the baton.

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a delight
for me to see others carry it.

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, let’s come back.

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:56.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re 15 years old.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get baptized at Yankee Stadium,

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:03.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now as a result
of being baptized at this age,

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you feel you benefited?

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing,

00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you know what you want to do
and you stay focused on it,

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:16.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes it easier to deal
with whatever challenges come later.

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:20.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so being dedicated

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and baptized early in life

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:28.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to stay focused on the truth.

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still remember that dedication.

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means something to me,

00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I tried to make it
mean something to others

00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:42.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(for as young as they can possibly make it).

00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:45.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll find the same thing I found:

00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s blessing will be with them.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, at 15,

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what doors start to open up?

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What opportunities come to you
because you are a baptized brother?

00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:59.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At age 17, I was appointed
as a ministerial servant.

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering right out
of high school at age 18.

00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And serving where the need was greater,

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a chance to work
at starting a new congregation.

00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:14.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so at 21,

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was congregation servant,
or an elder, at that point.

00:06:17.093 --> 00:06:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there was a need:

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The organization was looking for brothers
who could do traveling work.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at age 25, I had the privilege

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being a traveling overseer.

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, how did you feel
being an elder at 21?

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being a circuit overseer at 25?

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it a little bit overwhelming
at such a young age?

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:40.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared.

00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:45.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the truth,

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:49.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was uncertain about myself,

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:52.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then I also knew Jehovah would help me.

00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot as a young
traveling overseer, and I thank Jehovah

00:06:57.366 --> 00:07:02.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the people
in the circuits that I served 

00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endured those three years
that I was with them.

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:09.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, those were the challenges,

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:14.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what do you see as being the benefits
of being a young traveling overseer?

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the congregation, they had somebody

00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:21.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could stay out
in field service long hours.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:27.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the younger traveling overseer could relate

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the young people

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the younger adults in the congregation.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were other benefits
that even today different ones

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:42.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I served in earlier circuits
bring forth to me.

00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after having
a good time in field service

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:51.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the meetings,
I would do recreational things with the kids.

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we ran track

00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:57.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out in the streets,

00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we played board games,

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
softball, basketball,

00:08:03.866 --> 00:08:07.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we had good times
just talking about the truth

00:08:07.803 --> 00:08:10.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also talking

00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how you can put your ministry first,

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s plenty of time
for seeking a mate later.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, for a time,
you were serving as a single brother,

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at some point, that changed.

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did that happen?

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have enjoyed the best of two worlds.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:34.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed singleness
and the blessings Jehovah gave me.

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I was 28 years old,

00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married a beautiful pioneer sister,

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had already gotten adjusted
in my circuit work.

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was my second circuit.

00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:50.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, thanks to Jehovah,

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:54.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were able to be married, and to this day 

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gracie and I continue in full-time service

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after 52 years of marriage.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So R.P.,

00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:06.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you started with circuit work,
and then later you went on to district work.

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you were teaching
the Kingdom Ministry School.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:10.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:12.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you got invited to Bethel.

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:13.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:16.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 31 years at Bethel, right?

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you and Gracie
are doing special pioneer work.

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right, in Orlando, Florida.

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:28.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have more than 60 years
of full-time service to Jehovah.

00:09:30.186 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because of Jehovah’s blessing,

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:35.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s made me happy.

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question I want to ask you is:

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re looking back now
to these 60 wonderful years

00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than 60 wonderful years—

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you say to young people
who are facing the same decision

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you faced when you were
a little boy growing up in the truth?

00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the best thing
I could’ve done with my life,

00:09:56.712 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had many opportunities.

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:04.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed my humble efforts

00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:08.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he has blessed you and others too.

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:10.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young people today

00:10:10.726 --> 00:10:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have even more opportunities

00:10:13.963 --> 00:10:17.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah’s organization
under the leadership of Jesus Christ

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is expanding and moving fast.

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:25.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, like Brother Richardson taught me,

00:10:25.007 --> 00:10:27.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just make yourself available,

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the organization

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will find a place for you and use you,

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s so true today.

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of my greatest joys
is to see the young people

00:10:40.656 --> 00:10:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the baton and run with it,

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:47.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I have no regrets.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been no challenge

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:53.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has overwhelmed me
and made me regret things.

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:55.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were challenges, of course,

00:10:55.938 --> 00:10:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with Jehovah’s help,
well, I’m here today.

00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can be true of our young people.

00:11:04.714 --> 00:11:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So seize the opportunity while you’re young

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience the blessing

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gives those
who serve him from youth onward.

00:11:17.326 --> 00:11:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
R.P., it has been such a wonderful joy

00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have you here on this program

00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:25.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hear about your life filled with joy,

00:11:25.835 --> 00:11:28.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your life filled with blessings,

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all because of the decision
you made just as a little boy

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:35.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life
to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:11:35.244 --> 00:11:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:39.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.
I appreciate talking about it.

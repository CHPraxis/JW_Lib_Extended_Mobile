00:00:01 I’m so happy to welcome today
00:00:03 a very dear friend of mine,
00:00:05 Brother Robert P. Johnson.
00:00:07 R. P., welcome to the program.
00:00:10 Thank you, Mark.
00:00:11 I appreciate being here.
00:00:12 Now, you’re here, R.P.,
00:00:15 because you are a wonderful example
00:00:18 of someone who’s had a life
00:00:20 filled with blessings in Jehovah’s service.
00:00:23 OK.
00:00:24 So I know that your family goes way back in the truth.
00:00:26 Yes.
00:00:27 In fact, I understand that your great grandfather
00:00:31 learned the truth in Brother Russell’s time, even before 1914.
00:00:34 That’s right!
00:00:35 So that means you’re a fourth-generation Witness.
00:00:38 Mm-hm.
00:00:39 But now, like so many who are watching our program,
00:00:42 you were a little boy growing up in a congregation of Jehovah’s people.
00:00:47 So how did you come to the decision that you wanted
00:00:50 to dedicate your life to serve Jehovah and then get baptized?
00:00:56 Well, Mark, thinking back, I can identify
00:00:59 at least two outstanding influences in my life.
00:01:03 And the first was my parents.
00:01:07 Having that heritage in the truth helped me.
00:01:10 I was just an average kid in my early years.
00:01:14 But the parents instilled in me a desire
00:01:19 to please Jehovah and make it my life to do that.
00:01:24 They set goals before me.
00:01:26 They taught me the truth.
00:01:28 I learned enough from them to be able
00:01:30 to make a dedication to Jehovah God
00:01:33 and to have a close relationship with him.
00:01:35 And so early on, that’s what I did.
00:01:40 I remember that evening after supper
00:01:43 in my bedroom
00:01:46 praying to Jehovah to accept my dedication.
00:01:50 The date was May 25, 1949.
00:01:54 I was 11 years old at the time.
00:01:57 I told my parents, and they were happy,
00:02:01 but they just wanted me to wait longer to make sure
00:02:04 especially how I would handle the teenage years
00:02:08 and so on, so I waited.
00:02:11 And so then when did the moment come for you to finally get baptized?
00:02:15 It was at the 1953 international convention
00:02:20 in Yankee Stadium in New York
00:02:23 on July 22, 1953, when I was baptized.
00:02:28 And again, I remember that like it was yesterday.
00:02:31 When I came up out of the water,
00:02:33 I thanked Jehovah that finally,
00:02:37 “I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!”
00:02:40 and I also, like a child, added,
00:02:44 “You can bring the end anytime now.”
00:02:48 So you mentioned your parents, the good influence they had on you,
00:02:52 but was there another influence on you that helped you?
00:02:55 Yes.
00:02:57 At the 1953 convention, Brother Knorr had identified
00:03:01 that there would be a special program
00:03:04 for training people in the truth.
00:03:07 And from the congregation, there was a brother
00:03:10 of the anointed named Charles Richardson,
00:03:13 and my father asked Brother Richardson
00:03:16 to train me in this training program.
00:03:20 And Brother Richardson
00:03:22 was a mentor to me for the next five years of my life.
00:03:25 Over the years, he helped me
00:03:28 view the ministry as an opportunity
00:03:31 to help people develop a relationship with Jehovah
00:03:36 and, therefore, to reach out to them
00:03:39 in teaching them the truth —the doctrinal truth—
00:03:42 but to help them to see that Jehovah is a real person.
00:03:45 And he helped me to enjoy the ministry.
00:03:50 That is what has kept me happy
00:03:53 in Jehovah’s service down to this day.
00:03:57 Now, just from your expressions and what you talked about with me before,
00:04:01 I could see that this Brother Richardson
00:04:04 had a tremendous impact on your life.
00:04:06 And I think, R.P., it really made you
00:04:09 want to be a trainer of other people
00:04:12 because that’s how I first met you, right?
00:04:14 Right. Right.
00:04:16 You were the brother assigned to be my trainer
00:04:18 when I came to the Service Department.
00:04:20 I remember that fondly.
00:04:21 And I know that I’m not the only one.
00:04:24 I mean, you’ve really spent your whole life training other people.
00:04:28 Well, it’s been a privilege.
00:04:30 And I was trained; I was helped along the way.
00:04:34 I was nobody special, but Jehovah
00:04:37 has extended undeserved kindness to me
00:04:40 and made all these things possible.
00:04:43 So there’s no excuse for me not passing along the baton.
00:04:47 And it’s a delight for me to see others carry it.
00:04:52 So now, let’s come back.
00:04:55 You’re 15 years old.
00:04:56 You get baptized at Yankee Stadium,
00:04:58 and now as a result of being baptized at this age,
00:05:03 how do you feel you benefited?
00:05:05 For one thing,
00:05:07 if you know what you want to do and you stay focused on it,
00:05:12 it makes it easier to deal with whatever challenges come later.
00:05:16 And so being dedicated
00:05:20 and baptized early in life
00:05:24 helped me to stay focused on the truth.
00:05:28 I still remember that dedication.
00:05:32 It means something to me,
00:05:34 and I tried to make it mean something to others
00:05:39 (for as young as they can possibly make it).
00:05:42 And they’ll find the same thing I found:
00:05:45 Jehovah’s blessing will be with them.
00:05:47 So now, at 15,
00:05:49 what doors start to open up?
00:05:51 What opportunities come to you because you are a baptized brother?
00:05:54 At age 17, I was appointed as a ministerial servant.
00:05:59 I started pioneering right out of high school at age 18.
00:06:04 And serving where the need was greater,
00:06:08 I got a chance to work at starting a new congregation.
00:06:12 And so at 21,
00:06:14 I was congregation servant, or an elder, at that point.
00:06:17 Then there was a need:
00:06:20 The organization was looking for brothers who could do traveling work.
00:06:24 So at age 25, I had the privilege
00:06:28 of being a traveling overseer.
00:06:30 So now, how did you feel being an elder at 21?
00:06:34 being a circuit overseer at 25?
00:06:36 Was it a little bit overwhelming at such a young age?
00:06:38 I was scared.
00:06:42 I knew the truth,
00:06:45 but I was uncertain about myself,
00:06:49 but then I also knew Jehovah would help me.
00:06:52 I learned a lot as a young traveling overseer, and I thank Jehovah
00:06:57 that the people in the circuits that I served
00:07:02 endured those three years that I was with them.
00:07:06 But now, those were the challenges,
00:07:09 but what do you see as being the benefits of being a young traveling overseer?
00:07:15 For the congregation, they had somebody
00:07:17 who could stay out in field service long hours.
00:07:21 And also
00:07:24 the younger traveling overseer could relate
00:07:27 to the young people
00:07:29 and the younger adults in the congregation.
00:07:33 There were other benefits that even today different ones
00:07:38 that I served in earlier circuits bring forth to me.
00:07:42 For example, after having a good time in field service
00:07:46 and then the meetings, I would do recreational things with the kids.
00:07:51 And we ran track
00:07:54 out in the streets,
00:07:57 and we played board games,
00:07:59 softball, basketball,
00:08:03 and then we had good times just talking about the truth
00:08:07 and also talking
00:08:10 about how you can put your ministry first,
00:08:13 and there’s plenty of time for seeking a mate later.
00:08:18 So now, for a time, you were serving as a single brother,
00:08:21 but at some point, that changed.
00:08:24 When did that happen?
00:08:26 I have enjoyed the best of two worlds.
00:08:29 I enjoyed singleness and the blessings Jehovah gave me.
00:08:34 But when I was 28 years old,
00:08:39 I married a beautiful pioneer sister,
00:08:42 and I had already gotten adjusted in my circuit work.
00:08:46 This was my second circuit.
00:08:48 So, thanks to Jehovah,
00:08:50 we were able to be married, and to this day
00:08:54 Gracie and I continue in full-time service
00:08:57 after 52 years of marriage.
00:08:59 So R.P.,
00:09:02 you started with circuit work, and then later you went on to district work.
00:09:06 Right.
00:09:07 And then you were teaching the Kingdom Ministry School.
00:09:09 Mm-hm.
00:09:10 And then you got invited to Bethel.
00:09:12 Right.
00:09:13 And 31 years at Bethel, right?
00:09:16 Oh, yes.
00:09:17 And now you and Gracie are doing special pioneer work.
00:09:21 Right, in Orlando, Florida.
00:09:23 So you have more than 60 years of full-time service to Jehovah.
00:09:30 It’s because of Jehovah’s blessing,
00:09:32 and it’s made me happy.
00:09:35 So the question I want to ask you is:
00:09:37 When you’re looking back now to these 60 wonderful years
00:09:41 —more than 60 wonderful years—
00:09:44 what would you say to young people who are facing the same decision
00:09:49 that you faced when you were a little boy growing up in the truth?
00:09:53 It’s the best thing I could’ve done with my life,
00:09:56 and I had many opportunities.
00:10:00 Jehovah blessed my humble efforts
00:10:04 as he has blessed you and others too.
00:10:08 The young people today
00:10:10 have even more opportunities
00:10:13 because Jehovah’s organization under the leadership of Jesus Christ
00:10:17 is expanding and moving fast.
00:10:21 And, like Brother Richardson taught me,
00:10:25 if you just make yourself available,
00:10:27 then the organization
00:10:30 will find a place for you and use you,
00:10:33 and that’s so true today.
00:10:36 One of my greatest joys is to see the young people
00:10:40 take the baton and run with it,
00:10:43 and I have no regrets.
00:10:47 There’s been no challenge
00:10:50 that has overwhelmed me and made me regret things.
00:10:53 There were challenges, of course,
00:10:55 but with Jehovah’s help, well, I’m here today.
00:10:59 And that can be true of our young people.
00:11:04 So seize the opportunity while you’re young
00:11:08 and experience the blessing
00:11:11 that Jehovah gives those who serve him from youth onward.
00:11:17 R.P., it has been such a wonderful joy
00:11:19 to have you here on this program
00:11:22 and to hear about your life filled with joy,
00:11:25 your life filled with blessings,
00:11:28 all because of the decision you made just as a little boy
00:11:31 to dedicate your life to Jehovah and get baptized.
00:11:35 Thank you so much.
00:11:36 Thank you. I appreciate talking about it.

That’s a heavy one, Son.

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me help you.

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can do it, Papa.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to hurt yourself, Son.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I need someone
to prepare the talking machine.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can do it.

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Off you go, then.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born on December 4, 1916,

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a place called Sharon, Pennsylvania.

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m 102 years old.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father took
the “Photo-Drama of Creation” around.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very appreciative of my parents,
what they did.

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:57.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1931, I attended
the convention in Columbus, Ohio,

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:00.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I already knew my grand Helen.

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Brother Rutherford announced

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new name of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
she got real enthused about it.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first thing I did when I got
into my pioneer work was write to Helen.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a letter she wrote!

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:22.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “You didn’t tell me
the answer to the question I wanted to know.”

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was whether I was a pioneer or not.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote, “I am a pioneer,
and I hope I always will be.”

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we got a letter from Brooklyn,

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking us if we
were willing to go in the traveling work.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we accepted,
and so we went to west Kentucky.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:46.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aubrey and Bertha Bivens
were both from Kentucky too.

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how it is
when a couple of brothers

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are good friends
and their wives are good friends?

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we went to Gilead,
we were already good friends.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then a surprise came:
We were assigned to Guatemala.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And would you believe it?

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned
with the Bivens in the missionary home!

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when they were assigned to Puerto Barrios,
it was a sad thing.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:28.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real heartbreaker
to separate from the Bivens.

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we were assigned
back to Guatemala City

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the branch office.

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had an active life.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had many years of blessings.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very good as husband and wife.

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:04.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when my wife was sick,
it was very sad.

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’ve come to the end of my life,

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:25.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I beg Jehovah to take care of my David.

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for him, Jehovah,

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for our marriage.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wonderful and so happy!

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day Sister Helen passed away,
I went to his room.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was thinking:
‘I want to tell David that he is not alone

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—that I can accompany him if he wants me to.

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:06.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll be his traveling companion
whenever he needs me.’

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he knew he’d had
an incredibly good life with Sister Helen

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a wonderful life—
but also that he had to keep on going.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never isolated himself.

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Sister Helen died,
Brother David kept on serving

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Guatemala Branch Committee
for another 18 years.

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:35.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Brother David moved
to the Assembly Hall in San Lucas.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think living in the Assembly Hall
has done Brother David a lot of good.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every weekend he has the opportunity
to associate with the brothers and sisters.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have assemblies.

00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’re not my assemblies,
but I know many of the people.

00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:57.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I go down and say hello to them.

00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:59.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like the Bible says about the Christians

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is what made the difference—
that they loved each other.

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s wonderful.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have lots of friends too.

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My precious one,

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:29.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I ask you to put this text on your desk.

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:38.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It applies to you
and your long years of service to Jehovah.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 6:10 says:

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love you’ve shown for his name.’

It had been 18 years

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since my last visit to Indonesia.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How had Indonesia changed

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:20.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the past two decades
since the ban was lifted in 2001?

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our trip started
with the world’s longest flight

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:31.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—19 hours nonstop
from New York to Singapore,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then one more flight
from Singapore to Jakarta.

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia,

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a bustling metropolis

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a population of over 10 million people.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once hidden away,

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our branch office now occupies

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 31st floor in one of the most

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
modern office buildings in Jakarta.

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had the opportunity to spend a week

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:05.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with nearly 100 members
of the Indonesian Bethel family.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoyed association,

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worship, and delicious meals
together each day.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all
I would like to convey to you

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love and greetings
from the Governing Body.

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were also upbuilding meetings held

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with each of the various departments.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Saturday, January 12, 2019,

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special meeting was held.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 31,000 people throughout the country

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to benefit from the program.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An update on our activities within Indonesia

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was shared with the brothers and sisters.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This included a presentation

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about a special preaching campaign.

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From August 18 to September 2, 2018,

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Asian Games,

00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large multi-sport event,
was held in Indonesia.

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:04.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses made a special effort

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the good news
with people from various cultures.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This included many
from countries where our activity is limited.

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of publishers
participated in public witnessing

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:21.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at over 30 locations, using literature

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 21 languages.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:28.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A great witness was given
to people from various countries,

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tribes, and languages.

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, an update was shared

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the tragic events of September 28, 2018,

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a 7.7 magnitude earthquake

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tsunami struck Indonesia.

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers
at the branch sprang into action.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took care of both the physical

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the spiritual needs

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers and sisters
affected by this disaster.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very grateful to Jehovah,
the brothers from the branch office,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others whose prayers, examples,

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and presence really helped us to endure

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep relying on Jehovah
—no matter what.

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never felt alone.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so joyful to feel
the evidence of Jehovah’s love.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience has helped me to see

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is a real God.

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as David did
when he said at Psalm 103:2:

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let me praise Jehovah;
may I never forget all that he has done.”

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These reports were very faith-strengthening.

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:48.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was encouraging to see how Jehovah
has blessed the work in Indonesia.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the ban was lifted in 2001,

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work has accelerated

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hard work
of the brothers is clearly evident.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of the week,
we embraced old friends

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made many new ones.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:11.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the visit ended,
it was hard to say goodbye.

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we boarded the plane home,

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we took with us encouragement

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experiences that we will cherish

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for years to come.

If you were asked to think of two men

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the first century
who were zealous disciple-makers,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.406 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who would come to your mind?

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.200 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You may be thinking of Paul and Barnabas.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Together, they traveled extensively,

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching the good news
and helping many

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn the wonderful truth
about Jehovah.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work brought joy
not only to them but others too.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 15:3 states:

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:30.843 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“So after being escorted

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:33.137 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“partway by the congregation,

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:35.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“these men continued on

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“through both Phoenicia and Samaria,

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.436 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“relating in detail the conversion

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:42.354 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“of people of the nations

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:45.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and bringing great joy to all the brothers.”

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their shared experiences

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were a great source of joy
to the brotherhood.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all felt encouraged

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and united as one spiritual family.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, too, today, we have many
like Paul and Barnabas,

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are actively working
to find honesthearted ones.

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s quickly review the numbers

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what
our spiritual family’s united efforts

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have accomplished
during the 2019 service year.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news was preached in 240 lands.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The average number of publishers

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each month reached over 8.4 million!

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than two billion hours

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were spent in the field.

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you’ll be pleased to know

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the number baptized

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surpassed 300,000

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first time in 20 years!

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:44.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s, on average, 5,843 people

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symbolizing their dedication

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah every weekend.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s great potential

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for millions more to embrace the truth.

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On average, 9.6 million Bible studies

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were conducted each month,

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and almost 21 million attended the Memorial.

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We praise Jehovah for this growth

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thank you for your share
in this great increase.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:13.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body received

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:18.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some beautiful experiences
and reports this past service year,

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they wanted to share
that joy with all of you now.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to hear
some of these reports

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:28.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meet some
of our hardworking brothers and sisters?

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:31.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, then, let’s go!

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet publishers
from six regions of the earth

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear in their own words the effect

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the disciple-making work
has on them.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a quick peek.

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see some
of their unique challenges.

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it rains,

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is so much mud everywhere

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to remove our shoes
and hold them in our hands.

00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:00.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet ones
who made personal sacrifices.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I turned 60 and retired,

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I decided
to serve where the need is greater.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brother can see,
but he cannot walk,

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and me, I can walk but cannot see.

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see the impact
the truth can have on new ones.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me happy.

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was actually sort of in shock,

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really put a spotlight
on who I really was.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What bad habits did some have at first?

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What pressures did they face?

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did they overcome them?

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day she asked her to choose

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:50.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between family and Jehovah.

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hopefully that whets your appetite
for what’s to come.

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we take you around the world,

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:03.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoy the stories
of your brothers and sisters

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch for clues
to what contributed to their joy.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:10.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s begin with Africa.

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stretches from the Mediterranean

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
past the golden Sahara

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through mountains and savannas

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This continent is known
for the enormous diversity

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:27.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and richness of its wildlife.

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Africa’s population,
about 1.3 billion people,

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is growing faster
than any other part of the world.

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 1,500 languages
are spoken here.

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:46.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first Christian from Africa,

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:49.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ethiopian eunuch
mentioned in Acts chapter 8,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely brought the good news back with him

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:54.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Ethiopia when he returned home.

00:04:55.774 --> 00:05:00.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, over 1.7 million publishers

00:05:00.612 --> 00:05:03.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are making disciples
throughout this vast continent.

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:08.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit our brothers and sisters
in Africa’s most populous country:

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:10.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nigeria.

00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:14.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 360,000 publishers

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:18.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sharing the good news
with Nigeria’s over 200 million people.

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:22.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The territory is highly diverse

00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:27.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than 500 languages
and 250 ethnic groups.

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:32.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so encouraging to see
the response to the good news!

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:35.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some 870,000 Bible studies

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being conducted and, on average,

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
273 are baptized each week.

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:48.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Utonkon Congregation
in Benue state.

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:52.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, 51 publishers
and 4 regular pioneers

00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:57.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are having good results
despite a challenging territory.

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.006 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Preaching in the Utonkon territory

00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:02.591 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is enjoyable.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:04.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is just that it is accompanied

00:06:04.593 --> 00:06:06.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by some problems.

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is that the territories
are very far apart,

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and two, the roads are not good.

00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:17.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes us three hours
to get to some territories.

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:21.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it rains,
there is so much mud everywhere

00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:24.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to remove our shoes
and hold them in our hands.

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:28.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether householders
are church-goers, Muslims,

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:31.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or traditional healers, they listen.

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many even accept our invitation
to attend the meetings

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:37.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the travel challenges.

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:41.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it makes us very happy to see

00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in spite of far territories
and bad roads,

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see good results.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.014 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I am enjoying my life now,

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:53.016 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but when I lost my sight,

00:06:53.016 --> 00:06:55.018 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was all over.

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:58.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a carpenter,
I wondered how I would be able

00:06:58.063 --> 00:06:59.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do my carpentry.

00:06:59.523 --> 00:07:01.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought of it worried me so much.

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:05.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I began to learn about Jehovah
from the Bible,

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:08.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize that there was hope.

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:11.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That negative thinking
(that my life was over)

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:13.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disappeared from my mind.

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:14.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I am very happy now.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am joyful.

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:19.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a brother named Joseph.

00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:22.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brother can see, but he cannot walk,

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:25.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and me, I can walk but cannot see.

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hold his wheelchair

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and push while he directs it.

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has helped us to meet
many of our Bible students.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before now, we were few
that went out in the field as pioneers,

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:40.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now we are many.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This shows that the example
has helped other people,

00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:46.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when they see someone
who cannot walk

00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:49.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and someone who cannot see are pioneering,

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:52.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they conclude that they can pioneer too.

00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:56.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the experience
of one of my relatives.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name is Cletus.

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very kind to me.

00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would hold my hand and assist me
to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:10.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he got to the Kingdom Hall,
he would leave for his church.

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:15.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as he noticed how I preached
and attended meetings,

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy I radiated,

00:08:17.642 --> 00:08:19.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way we treated other people,

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:22.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our knowledge of the Scriptures,

00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was impressed

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and began asking many questions.

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:32.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answers he got were quite different
from what he had learned,

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:34.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they told him in church.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They continued telling him
to “get out of there”

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:41.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he should not talk to me again.

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:50.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He studied the Bible,
concluded his study, and got baptized.

00:08:50.884 --> 00:08:53.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he serves as a ministerial servant. 

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:57.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they used to assign talks to both 

00:08:57.474 --> 00:08:59.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of us to handle as a symposium,

00:08:59.643 --> 00:09:02.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this made me see Cletus
as a spiritual brother

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:05.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the organization and the congregation.

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:11.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives me joy and makes me very happy.

00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:15.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people notice our activities,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they usually praise Jehovah and encourage us

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do more since they know
that the work we do

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:23.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not by our power,

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:26.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is Jehovah who empowers us.

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:29.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is true that I am blind,

00:09:29.047 --> 00:09:31.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can see Jehovah.

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:36.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am helping other people
see Jehovah’s hand in our lives.

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:38.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even people who are disabled

00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:41.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can bring praise to Jehovah.

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:47.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have nothing to do other than to be joyful

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:49.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise Jehovah for my life.

00:09:51.611 --> 00:09:54.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We share your joy, Brother Igbo!

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:58.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t it touch our hearts
to see Gabriel and Joseph

00:09:58.952 --> 00:10:01.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping each other in the pioneer work?

00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:05.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their example
encourages others to ask,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:08.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What prevents me from pioneering?’

00:10:08.003 --> 00:10:11.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we’re moved
to ask that question too.

00:10:11.298 --> 00:10:15.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice
what spurred Cletus to action?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed the conduct of Gabriel

00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other Witnesses
in the congregation.

00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:22.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we learn?

00:10:22.142 --> 00:10:25.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That our Christian conduct
often speaks louder

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:28.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than even the most eloquent words.

00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:34.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we go to the largest continent
in the world: Asia.

00:10:35.614 --> 00:10:39.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Asia is home to three fifths
of the world’s people,

00:10:39.117 --> 00:10:43.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including some 760,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:47.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The geography of Asia ranges

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:49.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from tundra

00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:52.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to coral reefs

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from Earth’s tallest peak, Mt. Everest,

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:58.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to its lowest land surface, the Dead Sea.

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:03.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Asia’s cultural diversity
is greater than any other continent.

00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:06.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two most populated countries
in the world

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—China and India—

00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:11.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are here in Asia.

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:13.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit our brothers in India.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:19.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a growing population
of about 1.3 billion people,

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:24.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
India is on track to become
the world’s most populous country

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within a decade.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:30.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the potential for growth in India!

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:33.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With 90 percent of the population

00:11:33.296 --> 00:11:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having not yet received a witness,

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:40.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our 50,000 brothers and sisters
have plenty of work to do.

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:42.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news is being preached

00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:47.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in territory that includes
mountain ranges, plains and plateaus,

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:51.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
villages, and some
of the world’s largest cities.

00:11:52.607 --> 00:11:56.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hyderabad is in south-central India.

00:11:56.069 --> 00:12:01.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Hyderabad
RTC Cross Roads Congregation

00:12:01.032 --> 00:12:02.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the heart of the city.

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:05.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, 94 publishers,

00:12:05.662 --> 00:12:08.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including 17 regular pioneers,

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducting 95 Bible studies.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were delighted
to have 252 attend last year’s Memorial.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:21.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s meet Sangram.

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:25.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His story actually begins
in another part of India,

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he learned the truth
with the help of Alex and Anne Das.

00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:37.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I serve
in the Pandharpur Sign-Language Group.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Currently, there are only three publishers

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:43.241 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—me, my wife,

00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.243 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and another brother who is deaf.

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:50.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have contact
with around 100 deaf ones in our territory.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:57.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each week, 50 to 60 deaf ones
attend the meetings.

00:12:57.005 --> 00:13:00.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they come,
they bring their deaf friends with them.

00:13:00.383 --> 00:13:03.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also bring their relatives.

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy to see them
come regularly for the meetings

00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:09.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of the opposition
from their families

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:13.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes even severe opposition.

00:13:15.315 --> 00:13:18.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are progressing well spiritually.

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are really happy
to see their spiritual advancement.

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:27.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I turned 60 and retired,

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:31.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I decided to serve
where the need is greater.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To our surprise, we were asked
to support the sign-language field.

00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:37.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,

00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:41.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did not have any experience
in sign language.

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:43.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then our circuit overseer asked us

00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:46.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were ready to move
to where the need is greater.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked if we would move to Latur,

00:13:49.849 --> 00:13:53.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city that was 521 miles
(838 km) from our home.

00:13:54.604 --> 00:13:56.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we reached the city,

00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:59.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were overjoyed to see
the interest of the deaf ones.

00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we decided to stay there.

00:14:05.407 --> 00:14:08.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not long after we arrived there,

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:11.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we met a priest whose name is Sangram.

00:14:11.496 --> 00:14:14.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the leader of a deaf association,

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:17.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was short-tempered.

00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:21.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we wanted to meet him often,

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:25.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we invited him to our home
to discuss the daily text.

00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:30.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came regularly at seven o’clock
for daily text discussions.

00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:35.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we moved here,
we did not know how to sign very well;

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both my wife and I knew almost nothing.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:40.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after we met Sangram

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to teach him the Bible,
we, in turn,

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:46.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to learn sign language from him.

00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very happy.

00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really very happy.

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we started studying
the Bible with Sangram,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made changes in his life
in line with the Bible principles.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He changed his hairstyle.

00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:06.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He left the deaf association
of which he was the leader.

00:15:07.427 --> 00:15:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even his personality changed.

00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:13.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He stopped responding angrily
to those who provoked him.

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:15.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the Bible discussions we had with him,

00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because with these
his life changed completely.

00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:25.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he broke almost all of his bad habits.

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:31.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still unable to stop
his habit of chewing tobacco.

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since we loved him,

00:15:33.495 --> 00:15:36.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we took him to a dentist
and had his teeth cleaned.

00:15:37.874 --> 00:15:42.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that visit to the dentist,
he completely stopped using tobacco.

00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:47.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within six months
from starting the Bible study,

00:15:47.592 --> 00:15:50.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sangram became a qualified publisher,

00:15:50.887 --> 00:15:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after that,
he continued to progress well.

00:15:57.602 --> 00:16:00.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Latur now has a sign-language congregation.

00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:02.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
then moved to another group.

00:16:02.982 --> 00:16:06.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now serving in Pandharpur.

00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:09.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we meet
our old studies at the conventions

00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see their progress, we are overjoyed.

00:16:14.869 --> 00:16:19.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The very thought that Jehovah has extended
to us this privilege to serve him

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:22.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes us overwhelmed with happiness.

00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:25.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no words to express how we feel.

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:35.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Sangram
showed us his big smile,

00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did a smile come to your face too?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how the truth affects us.

00:16:40.728 --> 00:16:45.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t we appreciate
the sacrifices that Alex and Anne made

00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to serve
where the need was greater?

00:16:47.944 --> 00:16:52.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to learn sign language
and move far away from their home.

00:16:52.532 --> 00:16:54.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did it turn out?

00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:58.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex says they are
“overwhelmed with happiness.”

00:16:58.371 --> 00:17:00.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that.

00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:04.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were certainly rewarded
for their sacrificing spirit.

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:09.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now move west to Europe.

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:12.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Europe gave birth
to the Greek and Roman Empires,

00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:15.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.

00:17:15.972 --> 00:17:20.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With 160 culturally distinct groups,

00:17:20.268 --> 00:17:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Europe is immensely varied
and densely populated.

00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:28.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Almost 1.6 million Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:17:28.985 --> 00:17:32.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are actively making disciples
on this continent.

00:17:32.238 --> 00:17:35.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In southeastern Europe,

00:17:35.158 --> 00:17:38.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll find Romania

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:41.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a country of nearly 20 million people.

00:17:41.372 --> 00:17:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, over 39,000 publishers

00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:50.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducting
almost 22,000 Bible studies.

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:54.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eight out of ten people belong
to the Romanian Orthodox Church.

00:17:54.886 --> 00:17:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ratio of publishers
to the population varies greatly,

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1 to 4,000 in the southeast

00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:07.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 1 to 7 in Transylvania
in the northwest.

00:18:08.566 --> 00:18:11.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last year, special preaching campaigns

00:18:11.778 --> 00:18:15.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were organized to reach those
in unassigned territories.

00:18:15.448 --> 00:18:19.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, 85 percent
of these territories

00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been given a witness.

00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:28.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the 112 publishers
and 4 regular pioneers

00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:31.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Jibou Centru Congregation.

00:18:32.382 --> 00:18:37.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They serve a territory
that includes a small city, rural areas,

00:18:37.387 --> 00:18:40.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and large communities
of Hungarians and Roma.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what it’s like
to make disciples there.

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:49.482 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the challenges we face in our town

00:18:49.482 --> 00:18:51.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that we have a small territory

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:53.569 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
compared to the number of brothers

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:57.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a ratio of 1 publisher
to about 40 inhabitants.

00:18:58.574 --> 00:19:02.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we put great emphasis
on preaching in the villages around Jibou.

00:19:02.787 --> 00:19:04.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed our efforts,

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:08.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have more Bible studies
who make good progress.

00:19:12.296 --> 00:19:14.340 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was still in elementary school,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.384 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not yet baptized myself,

00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:18.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I used to speak about Jehovah

00:19:18.386 --> 00:19:20.388 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to one of my classmates.

00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her name was Oana.

00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:26.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very interested
and even asked many questions.

00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:28.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were both 12 at that time.

00:19:28.521 --> 00:19:31.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A little while later, after I got baptized,

00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana became my first Bible student.

00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:42.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to show her how
to prepare well for the study.

00:19:44.162 --> 00:19:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the evening,
we used to read the Bible together,

00:19:47.123 --> 00:19:50.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we even wrote down
in a notebook our favorite Bible texts.

00:19:50.585 --> 00:19:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
by means of different study projects,

00:19:55.298 --> 00:19:58.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to help her
see Jehovah as a real Person.

00:19:58.676 --> 00:20:02.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we wrote down
on a big sheet of paper

00:20:02.722 --> 00:20:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Jehovah’s qualities
and the way we could imitate them.

00:20:08.936 --> 00:20:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana made good progress,
attended the meetings,

00:20:11.814 --> 00:20:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even started to participate.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy to see

00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much joy Oana had
in learning about the truth.

00:20:23.493 --> 00:20:27.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not surprisingly,
difficulties arose on the way.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana’s mother was not happy at all
that I was studying with her daughter.

00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:38.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She forbade her to study,
and one day she asked her

00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to choose between family and Jehovah

00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:44.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put her out of the house.

00:20:44.347 --> 00:20:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana was 16 years old.

00:20:48.893 --> 00:20:52.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I encouraged Oana with the scripture

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Isaiah 41:10, 13,

00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:58.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jehovah
is ‘grasping our hand’

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:01.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will ‘help us.’

00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:05.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We talked a lot together,
and we prayed together.

00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after only one week,
Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:14.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana’s mother calmed down
and not only allowed her to return home

00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:18.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to attend meetings
and to continue studying together.

00:21:18.923 --> 00:21:22.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy!

00:21:23.344 --> 00:21:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the 21st of July, 2018,

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oana got baptized.

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:32.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I can finally preach
together with my spiritual sister.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always gave me the joy I needed.

00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I can’t find

00:21:39.068 --> 00:21:42.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the words to describe
the joy I experience now.

00:21:48.202 --> 00:21:50.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice where and when

00:21:50.204 --> 00:21:53.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beatrice started talking
to Oana about Jehovah?

00:21:53.749 --> 00:21:56.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In elementary school.

00:21:56.043 --> 00:21:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful reminder

00:21:58.254 --> 00:22:00.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you young ones can experience joy

00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making school your personal territory!

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you haven’t tried it already,

00:22:06.304 --> 00:22:09.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for someone with whom
you can share the good news.

00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:12.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be surprised at the results.

00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:16.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go next to North America.

00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:20.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this continent extends
from the tiny islands near the Arctic

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Isthmus of Panama in the south.

00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:30.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
North America is home to almost
2.6 million Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:22:31.412 --> 00:22:36.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The United States is by far
the most populous country in North America,

00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:39.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with over 325 million people.

00:22:39.837 --> 00:22:43.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you can find metropolitan cities

00:22:43.758 --> 00:22:46.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as vast areas
that are sparsely populated.

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:50.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This territory is cared for

00:22:50.431 --> 00:22:53.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more than 1.2 million publishers

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and over 180,000 pioneers.

00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:00.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet the brothers and sisters

00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:04.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Juniata River
Pennsylvania German Congregation

00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.

00:23:07.657 --> 00:23:10.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see in the following report,

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their unique territory is rich with people

00:23:13.162 --> 00:23:16.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sincerely respect God’s Word.

00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge is
our territory being so vast.

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you may drive
an hour and a half to two hours

00:23:33.057 --> 00:23:35.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to get to the territory.

00:23:35.726 --> 00:23:37.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of my favorite joys

00:23:37.728 --> 00:23:40.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is getting to use
the Bible constantly in this field.

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:42.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They respect the Bible.

00:23:42.817 --> 00:23:44.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all have one in their house.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:49.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting this language
almost three years ago, from a pregroup

00:23:49.615 --> 00:23:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to now a congregation with four groups
in the area, you can see the growth

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the excitement of everyone.

00:23:57.206 --> 00:24:00.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, I can say it’s been
the happiest time in my life

00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:02.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I started working in this field.

00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:13.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out in service one day,
just working from door to door,

00:24:13.055 --> 00:24:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I met a lady, and she
accepted the <i>Greatest Man</i>  book.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:19.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually,
Memorial season came around.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went and left an invitation with Jane.

00:24:22.189 --> 00:24:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went back
the day before the Memorial

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:26.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were surprised when Jane said,

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:28.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, we’d love to come.”

00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:31.198 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we talked about a Bible study,

00:24:31.198 --> 00:24:33.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and eventually Jerry agreed

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:35.661 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to having one as a family.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a contrast
from what I’d been taught,

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:44.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I was willing
to dig for more knowledge

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:48.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try and figure out
what was going on here.

00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:50.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He read a scripture in Psalms

00:24:50.593 --> 00:24:53.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the earth, and I said:

00:24:53.554 --> 00:24:58.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wow! Yes, all the things
I pictured myself doing in heaven

00:24:58.017 --> 00:25:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the things I enjoy on earth.”

00:25:02.229 --> 00:25:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me happy.

00:25:04.231 --> 00:25:06.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:25:08.235 --> 00:25:11.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I studied about the Bible
and looked up the scriptures,

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more I realized I never really knew
a whole lot about the Bible.

00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:18.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was actually sort of in shock,

00:25:18.913 --> 00:25:21.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really put a spotlight
on who I really was.

00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:27.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, Ben and I
went over to make a return visit.

00:25:27.588 --> 00:25:31.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had planned
what we wanted to do with the family,

00:25:31.175 --> 00:25:35.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just did not lend to that at all,

00:25:35.137 --> 00:25:37.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we ended up playing cards instead.

00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:40.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t get to share anything
from the Bible.

00:25:40.601 --> 00:25:42.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family was like, ‘Oh.’

00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:46.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It dawned on them;
we’re real people too.

00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Pennsylvania German culture,
people teach pretty strongly

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obedience to parents
to make God happy.

00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:57.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Jerry let me know
that his dad wanted to talk to me.

00:25:57.576 --> 00:26:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although my dad meant well,
he tried to stop the study.

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the information that he was 
bringing to me about the Witnesses

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not what I saw.

00:26:08.963 --> 00:26:11.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we were being taught

00:26:11.006 --> 00:26:14.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was directly from my Bible
that I had in my house.

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:16.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could it be wrong?

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could tell that they were just distraught
as a family with what was going on.

00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:25.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to do the right thing,
but they could feel all the pressure to stop.

00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We eventually had to cut ties

00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:33.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to continue spiritual growth.

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:39.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, Jerry and Jane
just progressed very fast.

00:26:39.326 --> 00:26:41.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were making changes in their life,

00:26:41.328 --> 00:26:45.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they got to really see the freedom
that serving Jehovah gives you.

00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:47.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing their joy grow

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was irreplaceable; it was fantastic.

00:26:56.427 --> 00:27:00.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have gained a hundredfold
of what we could have ever lost.

00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:04.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so as we share good news

00:27:04.518 --> 00:27:07.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with individuals
and as they make progress,

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are very excited and happy.

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:13.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would just love for everyone to have

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that opportunity to have that same joy.

00:27:17.948 --> 00:27:20.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened when Jerry and Jane

00:27:20.493 --> 00:27:24.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
read for themselves
the truths contained in the Bible?

00:27:24.705 --> 00:27:28.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It deeply affected
their thoughts and emotions

00:27:28.042 --> 00:27:31.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and revealed
who they really were on the inside.

00:27:31.462 --> 00:27:35.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, they now
joyfully serve Jehovah

00:27:35.716 --> 00:27:37.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with their children.

00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:41.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben and Joanna used the Bible skillfully.

00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:44.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They let God’s Word speak for itself.

00:27:44.934 --> 00:27:48.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the joy this experience
brought them is,

00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:52.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Ben said, 
“irreplaceable; . . . fantastic.”

00:27:52.566 --> 00:27:55.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of joy is contagious.

00:27:55.402 --> 00:27:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel it too just watching them.

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:02.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next we go to Oceania.

00:28:02.117 --> 00:28:05.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the collective name for Australia

00:28:05.704 --> 00:28:08.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the more than 10,000 islands

00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:11.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Pacific Ocean
between Asia and the Americas.

00:28:14.046 --> 00:28:16.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of Oceania’s islands,

00:28:16.674 --> 00:28:20.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are known as “high islands”
because they were developed

00:28:20.261 --> 00:28:24.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as volcanic eruptions
built up land over time.

00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Low islands,”
such as the country of Kiribati,

00:28:28.978 --> 00:28:33.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are made of coral and sometimes
barely reach above sea level.

00:28:33.816 --> 00:28:37.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 100,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses
are hard at work

00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:39.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this beautiful territory. 

00:28:41.907 --> 00:28:46.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fiji is an archipelago
of some 300 islands

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scattered over 3 million
square kilometers,

00:28:49.832 --> 00:28:52.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about 1 million square miles.

00:28:52.918 --> 00:28:55.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This territory is cared for

00:28:55.963 --> 00:29:00.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by some 3,000 publishers
and over 500 pioneers.

00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:03.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the last service year,

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they conducted over 4,700 Bible studies.

00:29:08.559 --> 00:29:10.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers and sisters

00:29:10.728 --> 00:29:13.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in the South Suva
English Congregation.

00:29:13.564 --> 00:29:18.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what unique challenges
our brothers face there.

00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:24.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many, if not all, in our territory
know about God’s Word, the Bible.

00:29:24.366 --> 00:29:27.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, they are taught false teachings.

00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:29.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge arises

00:29:29.246 --> 00:29:32.374 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when customs and traditions

00:29:32.374 --> 00:29:34.877 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
conflict with Bible teachings.

00:29:34.877 --> 00:29:37.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they study and progress,

00:29:37.338 --> 00:29:39.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face opposition from their family

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, there’s the social pressure

00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:44.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from their community.

00:29:44.178 --> 00:29:47.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Added to this are the materialistic goals
that are put before them.

00:29:47.473 --> 00:29:52.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of this combined really poses
a challenge with these ones progressing.

00:29:52.311 --> 00:29:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite these challenges,

00:29:53.562 --> 00:29:57.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of them eventually do
study the Bible with us.

00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:01.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have become Jehovah’s friend
and made the truth their own.

00:30:01.904 --> 00:30:05.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to be able to show these ones
from God’s Word,

00:30:05.032 --> 00:30:08.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible, that Jehovah is a God of love

00:30:08.452 --> 00:30:12.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see their reaction
—that in itself is a wonderful blessing.

00:30:14.458 --> 00:30:16.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to study with this young girl.

00:30:16.835 --> 00:30:19.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to make progress in the truth.

00:30:19.672 --> 00:30:22.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in order for her to do that,

00:30:22.049 --> 00:30:25.302 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she had to overcome these two big obstacles:

00:30:25.302 --> 00:30:28.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One was the career that she had,

00:30:28.555 --> 00:30:33.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other was the obstacle
of her unbelieving family.

00:30:34.228 --> 00:30:37.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t want
to impose the truth on her,

00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:41.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my goal was to help her
understand what the Bible teaches,

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:43.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help her see the big picture,

00:30:43.362 --> 00:30:45.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let her draw her own conclusion.

00:30:48.158 --> 00:30:52.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to be a good example to her by enjoying

00:30:52.496 --> 00:30:55.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ministry myself, you know,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping her to understand
that as I’m out in the ministry,

00:30:58.544 --> 00:31:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I’m working along with Jehovah.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although she had a high-paying job,

00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:07.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wasn’t happy.

00:31:07.177 --> 00:31:09.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was always stressed.

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:12.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then she sees Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:14.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite being out there in the ministry

00:31:14.476 --> 00:31:17.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on hot, sunny days or rainy days,

00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:19.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re happy.

00:31:19.648 --> 00:31:21.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She knew and was convinced

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would be really happy

00:31:24.236 --> 00:31:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she put Jehovah first in her life.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So eventually she had to tell
her mother-in-law

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she had resigned from her employment.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So her mother-in-law said:

00:31:35.038 --> 00:31:37.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And now you’ve resigned?

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, what are you going to do?

00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:39.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to go preaching?”

00:31:39.376 --> 00:31:41.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she said:

00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:45.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The decision that I have made
is going to make me happy.

00:31:45.507 --> 00:31:48.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to make Jehovah happy as well.”

00:31:48.427 --> 00:31:50.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In seeing the big picture,

00:31:50.721 --> 00:31:53.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was able to take a stand for true worship

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be on Jehovah’s side
of universal sovereignty.

00:31:57.895 --> 00:32:00.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I attended
the Pioneer Service School with her.

00:32:01.982 --> 00:32:04.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, what really made me happy

00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was seeing ones like her

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being happy in doing the same work

00:32:10.282 --> 00:32:12.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of helping others come to serve Jehovah

00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:17.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowing the fact
that Jehovah had actually used me

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping others

00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:21.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find the truth and serve Jehovah as well.

00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:31.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To some, Fiji may seem like paradise.

00:32:31.428 --> 00:32:35.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we learned,
the people of that beautiful land

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face the same issues
as people everywhere

00:32:37.851 --> 00:32:42.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—stress, pressure-filled jobs,
and an uncertain future.

00:32:42.773 --> 00:32:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Makereta’s student learned,
putting Jehovah first

00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:51.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the only guarantee
for true, lasting happiness.

00:32:53.158 --> 00:32:56.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our final destination is South America.

00:32:57.746 --> 00:33:01.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South America is home
to earth’s largest river, the Amazon,

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:06.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the driest place,
the Atacama Desert.

00:33:06.129 --> 00:33:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animal life on this continent
is rich and diverse,

00:33:10.926 --> 00:33:14.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly its bird population.

00:33:14.513 --> 00:33:17.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With some 3,000 species of birds,

00:33:17.432 --> 00:33:21.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South America is sometimes
called the bird continent.

00:33:21.353 --> 00:33:26.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 400 million people live here,

00:33:26.233 --> 00:33:30.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including over 1.7 million
Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:33:32.948 --> 00:33:35.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is tremendous
language diversity

00:33:35.576 --> 00:33:37.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in South America.

00:33:39.246 --> 00:33:41.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit Bolivia,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a country of more than 11 million people

00:33:44.459 --> 00:33:48.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a wide range of indigenous cultures.

00:33:48.463 --> 00:33:51.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bolivia presents unique challenges

00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:55.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our about 28,000 brothers
and sisters who live here.

00:33:57.806 --> 00:34:01.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory includes
the towering Andes Mountains in the west

00:34:01.226 --> 00:34:04.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rain forests in the north.

00:34:04.563 --> 00:34:07.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers endure weather

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ranges from burning heat 
and tropical humidity

00:34:10.402 --> 00:34:13.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to freezing winds.

00:34:13.488 --> 00:34:15.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach remote territories,

00:34:15.782 --> 00:34:19.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may have to cross rivers
and drive for hours

00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:22.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on poorly maintained mountain roads

00:34:22.164 --> 00:34:26.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes just a few millimeters,
or inches, from the precipice!

00:34:27.085 --> 00:34:31.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Jehovah is blessing
their courageous efforts!

00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:34.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the last service year alone,

00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:37.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 42,000 Bible studies
were conducted.

00:34:39.181 --> 00:34:44.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the 35 publishers
and 8 regular pioneers

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Norte Quechua Congregation.

00:34:47.397 --> 00:34:50.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach and seek out those
who speak Quechua,

00:34:50.901 --> 00:34:53.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publishers travel long distances.

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:57.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, many
of the Quechua-speaking community

00:34:57.991 --> 00:35:00.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been victims of prejudice

00:35:00.285 --> 00:35:02.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not receive basic education
in their language.

00:35:03.997 --> 00:35:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters spend hours

00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping interested ones learn to read

00:35:10.253 --> 00:35:12.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can
comprehend basic Bible truths.

00:35:13.632 --> 00:35:18.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The response to the good news
in Bolivia is very positive.

00:35:18.136 --> 00:35:21.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we’ll learn in the following report,

00:35:21.598 --> 00:35:24.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible students
frequently face opposition,

00:35:24.977 --> 00:35:28.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often from those closest to them.

00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:32.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When an interested person begins to learn

00:35:32.526 --> 00:35:34.611 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the truth from the Bible,

00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:36.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at first the family is happy for them,

00:35:36.738 --> 00:35:39.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their friends are happy too.

00:35:39.491 --> 00:35:44.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the teachings of the Bible
are in opposition to popular customs,

00:35:44.496 --> 00:35:48.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those family members and friends
may become their main source of opposition.

00:35:50.002 --> 00:35:54.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we have also seen many,
many blessings from Jehovah.

00:35:54.923 --> 00:35:57.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
although the challenges may be great,

00:35:57.926 --> 00:35:59.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see Jehovah’s hand

00:35:59.928 --> 00:36:02.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working in the lives
of each of these individuals,

00:36:02.347 --> 00:36:05.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they make <i>huge </i> changes.

00:36:05.434 --> 00:36:08.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They take hold of Jehovah,
they see him as their God,

00:36:08.854 --> 00:36:12.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they leave behind popular customs
and start to make progress.

00:36:12.774 --> 00:36:15.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a beautiful blessing
to see a Bible student

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get baptized, filled with joy.

00:36:19.948 --> 00:36:22.075 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Lydia was a young woman

00:36:22.075 --> 00:36:26.538 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who was very interested in spiritual things.

00:36:26.538 --> 00:36:30.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just like anyone
who does not study the Bible,

00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:34.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had habits
that were not pleasing to Jehovah.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She liked to socialize with her workmates,

00:36:37.632 --> 00:36:41.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at times,
she went out drinking with her friends

00:36:41.094 --> 00:36:45.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes drinking a little too much.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:51.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, despite that,
she was very humble.

00:36:51.438 --> 00:36:54.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could see that she was very sincere;

00:36:54.608 --> 00:36:58.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she appreciated good things.

00:36:58.236 --> 00:37:01.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After seeing
these beautiful qualities in her, 

00:37:01.823 --> 00:37:05.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Jehovah can make

00:37:05.285 --> 00:37:07.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other good qualities grow in her heart.”

00:37:09.289 --> 00:37:12.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we set the date to start the study.

00:37:12.584 --> 00:37:15.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always tried to be consistent

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to not miss a study.

00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:22.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a publisher does not miss
the day and time for the study,

00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:27.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Devil is not given
the opportunity to disrupt it.

00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:32.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some teachings Lydia accepted immediately,

00:37:33.396 --> 00:37:36.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but others took more time.

00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:40.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her manner of dress was not appropriate;

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:44.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wore tight clothing
and very short skirts.

00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:47.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did we correct that?

00:37:47.285 --> 00:37:49.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By showing her in the Bible

00:37:49.955 --> 00:37:54.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that women should dress
“with modesty and soundness of mind.”

00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:57.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy, but she did it.

00:37:57.379 --> 00:38:01.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, when she attended meetings,
she looked like one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:38:04.553 --> 00:38:07.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you plant a literal plant,
you start to water it

00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:10.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it keeps growing.

00:38:10.308 --> 00:38:14.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you are sleeping,
you don’t know how those changes happen.

00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It happens exactly the same way
with a Bible student.

00:38:21.778 --> 00:38:25.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time passed, Lydia expressed
the desire to be baptized.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, she just kept making progress

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:32.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to serve as a regular pioneer.

00:38:32.038 --> 00:38:35.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later,
she was invited to serve at Bethel.

00:38:36.459 --> 00:38:39.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has been serving
at Bethel for 16 years.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.552 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I am one of the 70 persons

00:38:45.552 --> 00:38:47.220 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who learned the truth from Edith.

00:38:48.263 --> 00:38:51.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her example helped me

00:38:51.683 --> 00:38:56.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be considerate, to be insightful,

00:38:56.104 --> 00:38:58.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to be consistent

00:38:58.064 --> 00:39:00.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making disciples.

00:39:02.402 --> 00:39:04.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:39:04.446 --> 00:39:08.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned so much
about disciple-making,

00:39:08.742 --> 00:39:12.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially that this work is not ours.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Bible students make progress,

00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:20.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because He sees their hearts.

00:39:23.048 --> 00:39:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re not working for a man;

00:39:25.675 --> 00:39:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re working for the Most High God.

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to see
ones like Lydia learn the truth

00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:41.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with God’s help
make the needed changes!

00:39:41.858 --> 00:39:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what joy it continues to bring
to her teacher, Edith,

00:39:45.528 --> 00:39:47.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see her serving Jehovah today!

00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Edith says,
“When Bible students make progress,

00:39:52.535 --> 00:39:55.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah,

00:39:55.705 --> 00:39:58.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because He sees their hearts.”

00:39:59.334 --> 00:40:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in our time together,

00:40:02.045 --> 00:40:06.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve circled the earth
to bring you these experiences.

00:40:06.716 --> 00:40:11.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice any patterns
for joyful disciple-making?

00:40:11.012 --> 00:40:14.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are just four patterns
that stood out to me.

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:17.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that the first step

00:40:17.102 --> 00:40:21.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to seek out all those
with the right heart condition.

00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:25.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers in Nigeria,

00:40:25.318 --> 00:40:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fiji, and Bolivia

00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:32.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread the good news
despite the great distances,

00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:35.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
poor roads, and extreme weather.

00:40:36.621 --> 00:40:39.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gabriel and Joseph teamed up

00:40:39.624 --> 00:40:42.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome their disabilities,

00:40:42.002 --> 00:40:46.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their example
inspires us to do more.

00:40:47.007 --> 00:40:50.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex and Anne Das
learned sign language

00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:53.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moved more than 500 miles

00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:56.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve where the need was greater.

00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:59.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we saw a second vital element

00:40:59.602 --> 00:41:03.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in disciple-making: the “art of teaching.”

00:41:03.982 --> 00:41:07.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know, for example,
that helping students

00:41:07.193 --> 00:41:10.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reason on the Scriptures
is very effective.

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:13.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the case with Makereta.

00:41:14.034 --> 00:41:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using the Scriptures,
she helped her student

00:41:17.162 --> 00:41:20.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draw her own conclusions
about the truth.

00:41:22.459 --> 00:41:26.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benjamin and Joanna
skillfully used the Bible

00:41:26.004 --> 00:41:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jerry and Jane.

00:41:28.048 --> 00:41:32.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The power of the Scriptures
touched their hearts.

00:41:32.594 --> 00:41:36.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when opposition came,
they stood firm

00:41:36.264 --> 00:41:40.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were convinced
that they were learning the truth

00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:42.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God’s inspired Word.

00:41:44.147 --> 00:41:48.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third element of disciple-making
involves helping our students

00:41:48.485 --> 00:41:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop good study habits
and a regular spiritual routine.

00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:58.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Edith and Lydia
made it a goal never to miss a study.

00:42:00.747 --> 00:42:05.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beatrice showed creativity,
developing projects

00:42:05.752 --> 00:42:09.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that big sheet of paper to help Oana
know Jehovah as a real Person.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:13.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And fourth: In every experience,

00:42:13.259 --> 00:42:17.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw that disciple-making involves love

00:42:17.347 --> 00:42:19.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—showing genuine love.

00:42:20.517 --> 00:42:25.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex and Anne took Sangram
to the dentist because they love him.

00:42:26.648 --> 00:42:30.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What motivated Cletus
to study the Bible?

00:42:30.318 --> 00:42:33.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy radiated by Jehovah’s people

00:42:33.696 --> 00:42:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the loving way we treat others.

00:42:38.326 --> 00:42:43.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angeline gave up
her stressful job and put Jehovah first.

00:42:43.331 --> 00:42:44.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:42:44.749 --> 00:42:47.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because she
observed Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:42:47.377 --> 00:42:50.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who out of self-sacrificing love

00:42:50.338 --> 00:42:53.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were motivated to preach the good news

00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on hot days and rainy days,

00:42:55.802 --> 00:42:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she especially noted
the joy it brought them.

00:43:01.474 --> 00:43:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see,
the joy of Jehovah

00:43:04.727 --> 00:43:08.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes from sincere efforts
to help people

and Jehovah’s blessing on those efforts.

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:15.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see and hear your brothers’
and sisters’ heartfelt expressions,

00:43:15.864 --> 00:43:18.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how does it make you feel?

00:43:18.283 --> 00:43:20.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul and Barnabas,

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:24.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too may have challenges
along the way, even some setbacks.

00:43:24.664 --> 00:43:29.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But nothing compares
with the deep joy and happiness

00:43:29.085 --> 00:43:33.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that results from helping others
come to know and love Jehovah.

00:43:34.382 --> 00:43:37.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are still
honesthearted ones out there,

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they desperately need the truth.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:44.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s experiences like the ones
we’ve just listened to

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help us to see that Jehovah
is truly speeding up the work.

00:43:49.856 --> 00:43:52.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time you go out in service,

00:43:52.567 --> 00:43:56.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
picture yourself working side by side

00:43:56.237 --> 00:44:00.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your brothers and sisters
around the world.

00:44:00.033 --> 00:44:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as in a search and rescue effort,

00:44:03.328 --> 00:44:07.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may feel we’re not finding
survivors in our area.

00:44:07.457 --> 00:44:11.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just one report of a rescue victim

00:44:11.544 --> 00:44:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being pulled out alive
spurs on all the volunteers

00:44:15.465 --> 00:44:17.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to double their efforts.

00:44:17.592 --> 00:44:20.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy Jehovah feels

00:44:20.845 --> 00:44:24.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he looks down and sees us

00:44:24.182 --> 00:44:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across the globe
working “shoulder to shoulder”

00:44:28.228 --> 00:44:32.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the greatest rescue mission
of all time!

00:44:32.398 --> 00:44:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep calling out;

00:44:34.817 --> 00:44:38.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep searching
through the rubble of this dying system

00:44:38.238 --> 00:44:41.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find those crying out for help.

00:44:41.282 --> 00:44:45.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may your joy abound as you do so.

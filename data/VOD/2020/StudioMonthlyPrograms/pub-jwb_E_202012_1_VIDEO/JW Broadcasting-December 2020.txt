00:00:02 Welcome!
00:00:04 Usually, our December program
00:00:06 features the Gilead graduation program
00:00:09 held in September of each year.
00:00:12 However, the 149th class of Gilead
00:00:16 was scheduled to arrive in the United States
00:00:19 when the COVID-19 pandemic was underway.
00:00:23 Therefore, that class was postponed.
00:00:28 So this month, we’ll focus on being
00:00:30 the best Bible teachers we can be!
00:00:35 Here are a few highlights:
00:00:37 Cecilio and Schera made many sacrifices
00:00:41 to help their students become
00:00:43 dedicated worshippers of Jehovah.
00:00:46 We’ll see the impact
00:00:48 they had on Mercedes and Abel.
00:00:52 The arrival of a baby brings
00:00:54 great joy as well as new challenges.
00:00:59 We’ll learn how Jehovah helps
00:01:01 first-time parents adjust to their new responsibilities.
00:01:07 And we’ll learn how Louise Blanton’s parents
00:01:09 prepared her for a satisfying life
00:01:12 in Jehovah’s service.
00:01:16 This is JW Broadcasting®
00:01:18 for December 2020!
00:01:40 My comments this month
00:01:42 are drawn from 1 Corinthians 3:10:
00:01:46 “Let each one keep watching
00:01:48 how he is building.”
00:01:50 Building
00:01:52 —are we talking about the upcoming construction
00:01:55 of a facility for headquarters departments in Ramapo, New York?
00:02:00 Or are we referring to the building of new Kingdom Halls in your country?
00:02:06 Well, as important as those building projects are,
00:02:10 my comments are directed to an even more important building work.
00:02:17 Let’s look at the context
00:02:19 at 1 Corinthians 3:5.
00:02:25 Apollos and Paul are mentioned by name.
00:02:28 And what was their specific role identified to be?
00:02:32 Verse 5 says
00:02:34 “ministers through whom you became believers.”
00:02:39 Apollos and Paul had taught the Scriptures to many in Corinth.
00:02:44 In verses 6 through 9,
00:02:46 Paul likens this teaching activity to the planting of a field.
00:02:51 Seeds of truth are planted in the heart of a person.
00:02:55 By means of return visits and Bible studies,
00:02:59 the seeds are watered.
00:03:01 But if the person is receptive,
00:03:04 then with Jehovah’s spirit and blessing,
00:03:07 the truth will blossom
00:03:10 and grow to the point of dedication and baptism.
00:03:15 Did you notice in verse 9
00:03:18 that Bible teachers are described as “God’s fellow workers”?
00:03:24 What an awesome privilege we have to assist Jehovah
00:03:28 in gathering “the precious things of all the nations”!
00:03:35 So we now know the topic of these verses
00:03:38 in 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
00:03:41 It’s discussing Bible teachers
00:03:43 who help others to become believers.
00:03:47 But did you also notice that in verse 9,
00:03:51 Paul changes illustrations?
00:03:54 He said: “You are God’s field under cultivation”
00:03:59 —that’s agricultural.
00:04:01 But then he changes the analogy,
00:04:03 saying “God’s building”
00:04:07 —that’s architectural; that’s construction.
00:04:12 Why the change in illustrations?
00:04:15 The building analogy highlights a specific point.
00:04:20 You see, the illustration of the farmer
00:04:23 doesn’t focus on the farmer’s impact on the growth of a plant.
00:04:28 In that illustration, the farmer waters the seedling,
00:04:32 but it’s God that makes the plant grow.
00:04:37 However, the illustration of building, or construction,
00:04:42 focuses on the builder’s involvement,
00:04:45 or the Bible teacher’s involvement.
00:04:49 The one constructing a building has considerable influence
00:04:53 over the quality of the end product.
00:04:56 What kind of materials does he select?
00:05:00 Is he thorough in his work,
00:05:03 or does he cut corners to get the job done faster
00:05:06 or with less effort?
00:05:10 Now let’s read the 10th verse
00:05:12 of 1 Corinthians chapter 3:
00:05:16 “According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me,
00:05:21 “I laid a foundation as a skilled master builder,
00:05:26 “but someone else is building on it.
00:05:28 “But let each one keep watching
00:05:31 how he is building on it.”
00:05:34 There in Corinth, Paul, as a “master builder,”
00:05:38 had initially acquainted many with the truth.
00:05:42 In effect, he “laid a foundation”
00:05:45 for others to build on.
00:05:48 But what was that foundation?
00:05:50 Verse 11 says:
00:05:52 “For no one can lay any other foundation
00:05:57 “than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”
00:06:02 Paul had helped establish the congregation there in Corinth
00:06:06 based on the teachings of Jesus,
00:06:09 the foundation of the truth.
00:06:12 Building on that foundation,
00:06:15 others would become Bible teachers
00:06:18 and help still others to progress toward baptism.
00:06:22 That is why Paul cautioned in verse 10
00:06:25 to “keep watching how” we build.
00:06:29 We can affect the outcome.
00:06:32 So to all of us Bible teachers, including parents,
00:06:37 we ask the question,
00:06:39 How are we building on the foundation?
00:06:44 Why does it really matter?
00:06:47 Let’s read verses 12 and 13:
00:06:51 “Now if anyone builds on the foundation
00:06:55 “gold, silver, precious stones,
00:06:58 “wood, hay, or straw,
00:07:00 “each one’s work will be shown for what it is,
00:07:03 “for the day will show it up,
00:07:06 “because it will be revealed by means of fire,
00:07:09 “and the fire itself will prove
00:07:12 what sort of work each one has built.”
00:07:16 Do we understand how important it is
00:07:19 to analyze our teaching techniques?
00:07:23 Will we use the best techniques possible
00:07:27 to reach our student’s or our child’s heart?
00:07:31 Or do we just try to get by with the bare essentials,
00:07:34 in effect, a halfhearted effort,
00:07:38 using hay or straw, as it were?
00:07:43 Some years ago in one developing country
00:07:46 during an economic boom,
00:07:48 it became a priority
00:07:50 to build more and more schools.
00:07:54 Unfortunately, building requirements and materials
00:07:59 were substandard.
00:08:01 Well, what happened when a 7.9-magnitude earthquake
00:08:06 hit one of the areas?
00:08:08 Many schools in the earthquake zone crumbled
00:08:13 while buildings around them remained standing.
00:08:18 An official report indicated
00:08:20 that over 5,000 students died.
00:08:25 Think about it.
00:08:27 Prior to the earthquake, schools were in session
00:08:31 and everything seemed fine.
00:08:33 Students and faculty
00:08:35 were coming and going on a daily basis.
00:08:39 But the unforeseen earthquake proved
00:08:43 that the building methods used
00:08:45 were not of the quality needed to prevent collapse
00:08:49 and terrible carnage.
00:08:53 First Corinthians 3:13 makes clear
00:08:58 that how we build spiritually when teaching Bible students
00:09:02 or our children
00:09:04 is just as important.
00:09:08 Now notice the sobering point
00:09:12 made in verses 14 and 15:
00:09:18 “If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains,
00:09:22 “he will receive a reward;
00:09:25 “if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss,
00:09:30 “but he himself will be saved;
00:09:32 yet, if so, it will be as through fire.”
00:09:37 The point in verse 14 is that if we’re conscientious
00:09:42 and reach the hearts of our Bible students,
00:09:45 that may be what gives them the needed fortitude
00:09:48 to withstand unexpected trials.
00:09:52 In that case, our diligent work “remains.”
00:09:56 Then verse 15 makes the point
00:09:58 that if our teaching techniques were inconsistent
00:10:03 or were in some way slipshod,
00:10:06 our student may not successfully weather a “fire,”
00:10:10 or stormy trial in his life.
00:10:14 We personally may survive,
00:10:17 but we might suffer the loss of the one we studied with,
00:10:21 whether a Bible student
00:10:23 or our own child.
00:10:26 That’s why Paul is highlighting the need
00:10:29 to be the best Bible teacher
00:10:32 we personally can be.
00:10:36 However, we should mention
00:10:39 that if a person who progresses to dedication and baptism
00:10:44 later leaves the truth,
00:10:47 it’s not necessarily the responsibility of the Bible teacher.
00:10:52 The teacher may have been very diligent
00:10:55 and used the best of spiritual building materials.
00:11:00 But the student or child may not have responded from his heart.
00:11:05 Or possibly he allowed human imperfection or temptation
00:11:10 to cause him to deviate from the way.
00:11:14 But the takeaway point from 1 Corinthians chapter 3
00:11:19 is to do our best to build in our students or children
00:11:24 fire-resistant materials.
00:11:27 We want them to remain
00:11:30 —to endure the tests that are sure to come their way.
00:11:35 What might be likened to building with inferior materials
00:11:39 when studying the Bible with someone?
00:11:42 Possibly, we initially aroused a person’s interest
00:11:46 by telling him about the hope of everlasting life in Paradise.
00:11:51 That’s indeed Scriptural.
00:11:53 But is that in itself building in such a way
00:11:56 that the person will survive
00:11:58 a fiery trial of faith in the future?
00:12:04 What if our teaching consisted solely of saying,
00:12:08 “If you want to live forever in Paradise,
00:12:10 “you must study, go to the meetings,
00:12:14 and share in the preaching work”?
00:12:17 If so, we are not building
00:12:20 in a way to ensure
00:12:22 that the student or child
00:12:25 will resist the fire of trials
00:12:28 or stand the test of time.
00:12:31 In effect, we’re using wood, hay, or straw.
00:12:38 Do you remember that Paul said we are to build “on the foundation”?
00:12:43 He said the foundation “is Jesus Christ.”
00:12:46 That is solid.
00:12:50 Ephesians 3:16, 17
00:12:55 help us to understand what it means
00:12:58 to build with quality materials
00:13:00 such as gold, silver, and precious stones.
00:13:05 In verse 16, it makes clear that there’s a way
00:13:10 that we can “be made mighty in the [person we] are inside.”
00:13:17 Let’s read verse 17:
00:13:19 “And that through your faith
00:13:21 “you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.
00:13:25 May you be rooted and established on the foundation.”
00:13:31 How can we help our child or Bible student
00:13:34 become strong, or mighty, spiritually?
00:13:38 Interestingly, verse 17 said
00:13:41 that it’s by having “the Christ dwell in your hearts,”
00:13:46 not just knowing Jesus in the head
00:13:49 but sounding his teachings and personality down
00:13:53 into our student’s heart.
00:13:56 It means to know Jesus so well
00:14:00 that it’s as if he lives, or dwells, inside of us
00:14:04 and motivates us as Christians.
00:14:08 The result?
00:14:10 Verse 17 concluded by saying
00:14:12 that the student would become
00:14:14 “rooted and established on the foundation.”
00:14:18 Yes, solidly grounded
00:14:21 on Jesus Christ.
00:14:24 And Hebrews 1:3
00:14:26 says that “[Jesus] is the reflection of God’s glory
00:14:29 and the exact representation of his very being.”
00:14:34 Jesus himself said:
00:14:37 “No one comes to the Father except through me.”
00:14:41 So building with fire-resistant materials means
00:14:45 helping the student to love Jesus, yes,
00:14:48 but also to have a close, loving relationship
00:14:52 with Jehovah God himself.
00:14:56 But why are we considering the theme
00:14:59 ‘Keep Watching How You Are Building’ now?
00:15:03 Why is this more urgent than ever before?
00:15:09 It’s because all indications,
00:15:12 Scripturally and circumstantially,
00:15:15 point to Satan’s evil system of things coming to an abrupt end.
00:15:21 The physical indications of Matthew chapter 24
00:15:26 and the bizarre temperament described
00:15:28 at 2 Timothy 3:1-5
00:15:31 become more and more precise
00:15:35 as we watch “the scene of this world” unfold.
00:15:40 We can expect even more opposition and persecution
00:15:44 from those who are opposed to our resolve
00:15:48 to stand on the side of Jehovah.
00:15:51 Our brothers in Russia and other lands
00:15:54 are experiencing this now.
00:15:58 Some have been beaten
00:16:00 and brutalized in other ways.
00:16:02 As we’ve heard,
00:16:05 others have been sentenced to years in prison.
00:16:09 In recent years, the organization has reminded us of what we can expect
00:16:14 as the great tribulation begins.
00:16:19 Do you remember this video clip
00:16:21 from the Pursue What Builds Loyalty video series
00:16:25 shown at the 2016 regional convention?
00:16:29 Be reminded.
00:16:33 And your faith has led you here
00:16:37 as loyal servants of Jehovah,
00:16:40 confident that Psalm 97:10
00:16:44 applies to you personally:
00:16:47 “[Jehovah] is guarding the lives of his loyal ones.”
00:17:02 Where are they?
00:17:06 Try the basement!
00:17:13 Check that door!
00:17:55 That video series has been affectionately called
00:17:59 the basement video.
00:18:02 It was depicting one possible scenario
00:18:05 that could be considered a “fire”
00:18:07 according to 1 Corinthians 3:13.
00:18:11 The serious question we want to ask ourselves is,
00:18:15 ‘Would my Bible student or child
00:18:18 be in the basement with those other faithful brothers and sisters?’
00:18:24 If not, would the reason be
00:18:27 because of his own lack of faith?
00:18:30 Or might it, at least in part, be
00:18:33 because we did not take our responsibility as a teacher
00:18:38 seriously enough?
00:18:41 Did we build with fire-resistant materials
00:18:45 or, in effect, with hay or straw?
00:18:50 The same verse said:
00:18:52 “For the day will show it up . . .
00:18:56 “the fire itself will prove
00:18:58 what sort of work each one has built.”
00:19:01 It’s a sobering thought, isn’t it?
00:19:05 If you recall in the May 2020
00:19:08 JW Broadcasting® monthly program,
00:19:11 Brother Lett addressed the concern a few parents have expressed
00:19:15 about some of our videos that depict
00:19:17 Biblical or modern-day situations.
00:19:21 In these, at times, true worshippers are depicted
00:19:24 as having their faith tested
00:19:27 as if by fire.
00:19:29 The concern expressed is that some scenes
00:19:33 could have an effect on children
00:19:35 who’ve been protected from all negative circumstances on TV,
00:19:40 including daily news reports of catastrophes
00:19:44 being faced by real people.
00:19:47 The basement scene we just reviewed
00:19:50 was one of our videos
00:19:52 that produced such a reaction.
00:19:56 Another one was the reenactment of the Bible account
00:19:59 depicting Jehovah’s saving acts in the time of King Hezekiah.
00:20:04 It was shown at the 2016 regional convention,
00:20:08 and the video is entitled
00:20:10 “O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You.”
00:20:14 Let’s look again at that portrayal of Jehovah’s saving acts.
00:20:38 My lord!
00:20:44 If a parent has shielded his child
00:20:47 from viewing all scenes on the news
00:20:50 or other visual images depicting negative realities,
00:20:55 it’s understandable that there may be a concern.
00:21:00 However, as Brother Lett stated:
00:21:04 ‘Parents need to give their children a realistic idea
00:21:08 ‘of what we will face in the near future.
00:21:13 ‘Many parents choose to help their children appreciate
00:21:17 ‘the graphic visual imagery of a Bible-based account
00:21:21 ‘while at the same time building trust in Jehovah,
00:21:25 who will be with them in times of distress.’
00:21:28 The point is, friends,
00:21:30 the Bible warns us, young and old alike,
00:21:33 that a time of fiery testing looms on the horizon.
00:21:38 We want to be realistic and face these events
00:21:41 with faith and courage.
00:21:44 Our videos depict such circumstances
00:21:48 in a tasteful and sanitized way,
00:21:51 not showing any actual acts of bloodshed or violence.
00:21:57 Be assured that the Governing Body
00:22:00 is not trying to scare anyone.
00:22:04 Instead, we are trying
00:22:07 to prepare everyone.
00:22:10 We feel responsible to fortify the brotherhood
00:22:13 by using fire-resistant building materials
00:22:17 in the spirit of 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
00:22:21 As teachers of the Word of God,
00:22:24 may we all give prayerful thought to the methods,
00:22:28 techniques, and the diligence we display
00:22:32 when conducting Bible studies.
00:22:35 We’re motivated by the very spirit of Jehovah God.
00:22:40 The words at 2 Peter 3:9 come to mind.
00:22:44 Of Jehovah, it says:
00:22:46 “He does not desire anyone to be destroyed
00:22:51 but desires all to attain to repentance.”
00:22:56 May that be our resolve
00:22:58 as we take to heart the inspired words of 1 Corinthians 3:10:
00:23:03 “Let each one keep watching how he is building”!
00:23:09 Having children is one of the greatest joys in life
00:23:14 and one of the greatest responsibilities
00:23:17 Jehovah entrusts to a husband and wife.
00:23:20 In the following dramatization,
00:23:22 notice how the arrival of a baby changes a marriage
00:23:26 and how Jehovah helps first-time parents.
00:23:35 Jehovah has been so good to us.
00:23:47 We enjoy a busy life full of blessings . . .
00:23:57 . . . including one we didn’t expect.
00:24:13 We love our little Emma so much!
00:24:23 But child-rearing was harder than we thought.
00:24:49 Most days went well
00:24:56 —others, not so much.
00:25:05 I just need some rest.
00:25:09 When will things be back to normal?
00:25:12 I wake with every little cry!
00:25:16 I wake when she’s silent.
00:25:19 Am I doing this right?
00:25:23 I should check on them.
00:25:27 Any time to ourselves was time to do nothing.
00:25:30 Fatigue was affecting our relationship with Jehovah . . .
00:25:36 . . . and each other.
00:25:52 We were so relieved when David, a father himself,
00:25:56 offered to visit with another elder.
00:26:02 We read Isaiah 40:29:
00:26:06 “He gives power to the tired one
00:26:09 and full might to those lacking strength.”
00:26:14 As a loving Father,
00:26:17 Jehovah wants parents to succeed.
00:26:19 So he gives us what we need to recharge us.
00:26:24 Things might never be like they were before.
00:26:26 But his suggestions helped us create
00:26:28 a practical and consistent spiritual routine.
00:26:32 David said it’s normal for new parents to feel anxious,
00:26:36 and anxiety is tiring.
00:26:39 So we pray for a calm heart . . .
00:26:42 . . . and extra kindness when tired,
00:26:46 so we can keep working as a team.
00:26:59 I so appreciate Zack’s help.
00:27:06 And I’m sacrificing some unnecessary things
00:27:11 to put spiritual things first.
00:27:24 There will always be a lot to do.
00:27:30 But when Emma sleeps,
00:27:34 I feed my faith
00:27:38 and rest.
00:27:44 Our new spiritual routine is invigorating.
00:28:05 Hey, Daddy!
00:28:06 Look!
00:28:08 Hey.
00:28:17 Jehovah helped us to understand.
00:28:20 While life in this system may have many challenges,
00:28:23 putting spiritual things first
00:28:26 will give us the strength to meet them.
00:28:33 That new father wanted life to get “back to normal.”
00:28:38 But all parents realize
00:28:41 that having children creates a “new normal.”
00:28:46 If you are first-time parents, please remember,
00:28:50 one of the most important adjustments you’ll make
00:28:53 is to establish a new spiritual routine
00:28:57 for yourselves and your precious little child.
00:29:03 Of course, children grow,
00:29:06 and when they cross into their teenage years,
00:29:09 suddenly, everything seems to change.
00:29:12 In the following video, notice how Rudy and Nenita Garcia
00:29:17 were determined to teach their daughters Jehovah’s ways
00:29:21 and the results they experienced.
00:29:25 We already had our firstborn, Renita.
00:29:28 And then I was told that we were going to have twins.
00:29:31 We were new in the truth and inexperienced.
00:29:34 So I was saying to myself:
00:29:37 ‘How can I take care of my children, not only physically but more so spiritually?
00:29:41 ‘How will I be able to teach them to love Jehovah,
00:29:45 to worship Jehovah?’
00:29:47 And 1 Corinthians 3:10
00:29:50 shows us the importance
00:29:52 of raising a family
00:29:54 by using good quality materials.
00:29:57 So having a spiritual routine is very important for the children.
00:30:02 My wife and I would have to lay a good spiritual foundation.
00:30:07 We would have to set a good example for our children.
00:30:12 As long as I could remember, I would always see my parents studying,
00:30:16 doing personal Bible study.
00:30:18 I remember Dad—one time, he came to us in the living room,
00:30:22 and he said, “You know, I was reading Psalm 1:2,
00:30:26 “where it said we should find ‘delight in the law of Jehovah
00:30:29 and read in an undertone day and night.’”
00:30:32 He said, “What if we do this as a family project,
00:30:35 like, we read the Bible every day out loud together?”
00:30:40 And my parents were very simple, you know.
00:30:42 They didn’t require a lot of fancy things.
00:30:46 They were content.
00:30:47 Mom and Dad always worked part-time.
00:30:50 Dad pioneered, so money was limited.
00:30:54 Sometimes the car we had wasn’t the most reliable,
00:30:58 and it would break down right before the meeting.
00:31:00 I remember when our car broke down.
00:31:02 Initially I thought, ‘Oh, we’re not going to go to the meeting.’
00:31:06 Mom and Dad would say: “Well, the car broke down.
00:31:09 There’s a meeting tonight, so let’s walk.”
00:31:12 So there are the five of us —my dad in his suit,
00:31:16 the four women would be in our dresses with our book bags.
00:31:19 And so that taught me not to let obstacles
00:31:22 and anxieties prevent me from going to my meetings.
00:31:26 Spending quality time was very important to my parents,
00:31:31 especially after the meetings.
00:31:33 We would change into our pajamas, grab a snack,
00:31:36 go to the living room, and just start talking
00:31:39 about how our day went and how the meeting went.
00:31:46 Just those special moments
00:31:48 —they brought us closer together.
00:31:51 I saw that Dad,
00:31:54 no matter how busy he was,
00:31:56 would drop what he was doing and look at me and talk.
00:32:01 I knew I was more important to him than what he was doing.
00:32:05 I remember a time when I had a crush on a boy.
00:32:09 My parents reasoned with me.
00:32:11 I felt very comfortable, you know, after that point, to maybe talk
00:32:15 about other things because I could see that my parents
00:32:18 were not going to be angry at me.
00:32:21 You know, they were going to listen to me and what I was feeling.
00:32:24 One of the blessings that Mom and Dad gave me
00:32:28 was teaching me how to think
00:32:31 and meditate on scriptures.
00:32:34 They encouraged us to set full-time service,
00:32:38 or pioneering, as a goal.
00:32:40 We all worked part-time, me and my siblings.
00:32:44 And I remember one close family friend
00:32:48 said to me: “You know, your parents are getting older.
00:32:52 “You know, you’re their daughter, and you should probably work full-time.
00:32:57 That way they’d have more of an easy life.”
00:33:00 After that sister’s conversation, I almost gave up
00:33:03 on pioneering, but I knew deep down
00:33:07 that my parents would not be happy about that.
00:33:10 They wanted us to spend our youth serving Jehovah.
00:33:14 My husband and I were invited to attend
00:33:19 the 145th class of Gilead, and that was like a dream come true.
00:33:23 I have to thank my parents for that
00:33:26 because they always supported me through the years.
00:33:30 I couldn’t have done it without them,
00:33:32 and for that I’ll be forever grateful.
00:33:35 I really do thank my parents
00:33:38 for the upbringing that they gave me.
00:33:41 I have a very happy life.
00:33:43 I’m thankful that I was able
00:33:45 to avoid a lot of heartache,
00:33:48 and that’s because my parents raised me
00:33:52 in the truth and in Jehovah’s way.
00:33:54 Children are born imitators,
00:33:57 and they’re going to imitate our example.
00:34:01 I want to thank Jehovah for what our family is now.
00:34:06 To see all of us in the pioneer work
00:34:11 —all five of us are pioneering— thank you, Jehovah.
00:34:17 Raising three daughters
00:34:19 took years of work and sacrifice.
00:34:23 But Rudy and Nenita are joyful,
00:34:26 knowing their daughters are happily serving Jehovah full-time.
00:34:32 Likewise, if we build in our children
00:34:35 fire-resistant materials,
00:34:38 then we give them everything they need
00:34:40 to make wise decisions themselves.
00:34:44 This was the case for Louise Blanton.
00:34:48 Notice how her parents’ building techniques
00:34:52 helped her to choose a fulfilling life.
00:34:58 My family started studying with Witnesses in New Jersey.
00:35:03 My parents had been very diligent in helping us to appreciate
00:35:06 not only Bible principles
00:35:09 but also characters in the Bible
00:35:11 who could be a role model for us.
00:35:15 It helped us to know that Jehovah cared
00:35:18 not only for adult publishers
00:35:22 but also for the children
00:35:24 that were serving him.
00:35:27 When you went out in the ministry,
00:35:30 it became such a common thing
00:35:34 —the police would come and pick you up.
00:35:36 If they couldn’t track down the parents, they would put the children in jail,
00:35:41 knowing that eventually the parents would have to come looking for them.
00:35:46 The police would use scare tactics.
00:35:49 They’d say: “There are rats in the cell.
00:35:53 Is that where you want to be?”
00:35:55 —anything to make you fearful,
00:35:58 to intimidate you to tell them where your parents were.
00:36:03 They’d put us in the jail,
00:36:05 and in order to build our faith, we would sing.
00:36:09 We didn’t have Kingdom melodies back then,
00:36:12 so we used to make up songs,
00:36:15 and that would keep us focused
00:36:18 on what we were doing there.
00:36:21 After I reached the age of 18,
00:36:24 my parents were agreeable to my accepting an assignment.
00:36:28 And in those years,
00:36:30 because of the racial issue in the south,
00:36:35 there were so many areas in the south
00:36:38 where they didn’t have Kingdom Halls
00:36:41 that the colored could attend.
00:36:43 So if you were free  and you would accept an assignment,
00:36:48 the Society usually sent you to the south.
00:36:52 My parents were both born in the south,
00:36:55 so they were able to tell us what to expect
00:37:00 to keep the culture shock from being so great.
00:37:04 I was assigned to pioneer in Andalusia, Alabama.
00:37:09 Based on all of the matters that pertain
00:37:14 to integration and segregation,
00:37:17 this was a hotbed
00:37:20 for testing those issues.
00:37:24 And so I was concerned
00:37:27 about whether I had the fiber
00:37:30 to work under those circumstances.
00:37:36 The field was wide open.
00:37:38 There were so many in the area
00:37:40 that had no knowledge of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:37:44 and were very receptive to the message.
00:37:47 That part of our ministry was very rewarding.
00:37:52 We had some very strong
00:37:56 and helpful brothers
00:37:59 that Jehovah was using
00:38:02 to get his people
00:38:07 —no matter what color—
00:38:09 to appreciate Him and his purpose.
00:38:13 When you focused on these things
00:38:16 —the suggestions and the ideas—
00:38:18 the brothers would help you to appreciate
00:38:20 how to deal with the issues.
00:38:23 They taught us, for one thing,
00:38:26 that the whole purpose of the Ku Klux Klan
00:38:29 is to intimidate.
00:38:32 They feel that if they frighten you enough,
00:38:35 you will leave.
00:38:37 Satan has always used
00:38:40 methods to try to intimidate.
00:38:43 But we would make it a practice to stay, to hold our place.
00:38:47 When we were in street work, we’d stay right there.
00:38:51 And of course, as they passed,
00:38:53 they had their remarks to make,
00:38:56 but we just stood there.
00:38:58 When I think back on my youth,
00:39:02 there isn’t anything that I was able to participate in
00:39:05 that I came to regret.
00:39:07 There were always blessings that went along with it.
00:39:10 If you make yourself available,
00:39:13 Jehovah will use you.
00:39:16 Jehovah is always there as a support.
00:39:20 There isn’t anything that he directs his organization to do
00:39:26 that doesn’t receive his support.
00:39:30 So if we are challenged with a new assignment
00:39:33 or if we feel inadequate about it,
00:39:38 if we look to Jehovah
00:39:41 —with Jehovah, you can’t fail.
00:39:45 Louise’s parents taught her to appreciate principles
00:39:49 and characters in the Bible.
00:39:52 That reached her heart
00:39:54 and aided Louise to endure difficult trials.
00:39:59 She has now spent over 50 years
00:40:01 of her life in the full-time service,
00:40:04 including over 40 years in Bethel service.
00:40:09 Hard work and sacrifice
00:40:12 may also be needed to help our Bible students
00:40:15 to become disciples.
00:40:17 We’ll see that in our next video.
00:40:25 A teacher should always help his or her student
00:40:28 to develop love for Jehovah.
00:40:32 That’s the best foundation to build on.
00:40:36 For me, it’s important that they see Jehovah
00:40:39 as a real Person.
00:40:41 In order to help them build a good foundation, they need to know
00:40:45 that Jehovah gave us the Bible so that we can receive his guidance
00:40:49 for the future and for eternity.
00:40:54 I’m so thankful for my Bible teacher.
00:40:56 She always helped me see Jehovah’s point of view
00:40:59 on things from the Bible.
00:41:03 I’ll never stop thanking Jehovah
00:41:05 for what he’s done for me.
00:41:07 He drew me to the truth.
00:41:09 He gave me a teacher that didn’t just teach me about the Bible,
00:41:13 but by his example, the brother taught me
00:41:15 how to really be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:41:20 When I started studying,
00:41:22 my parents told me that they didn’t consider me their daughter anymore.
00:41:28 During the study, my teacher helped
00:41:31 me see from the Bible that Jehovah had a lot of really good things in store for me.
00:41:43 My environment was very hostile before.
00:41:48 My problem was that my wife and I argued a lot,
00:41:51 and I had a bad temper.
00:41:55 The brother’s advice really helped us to keep calm when we had problems.
00:42:03 When a person starts getting to know Jehovah and they learn
00:42:07 and apply Bible truths in their lives,
00:42:10 the people who were their friends before are going to disappear.
00:42:15 We need to give them that friendship they’re losing.
00:42:22 We’ve had to make some sacrifices for our students.
00:42:26 But when we think about the blessings,
00:42:28 we can barely remember the sacrifices.
00:42:32 I worked full-time,
00:42:36 but I had to adapt to the student’s needs,
00:42:38 not the other way around.
00:42:41 Sometimes I’d be up at six o’clock in the morning
00:42:43 conducting a Bible study.
00:42:45 Sometimes things come up, and you can’t make it.
00:42:48 But the study should still happen.
00:42:51 Another brother can study with them if we’re not going to be there.
00:42:55 When someone starts studying, it can feel like a lot.
00:42:59 The Bible itself has 66 books.
00:43:02 So for example, you can suggest that the student start reading
00:43:06 a few verses every day
00:43:08 and then add a little more every week.
00:43:10 So that is how we see them progress.
00:43:13 You get to see them practice what they’re learning
00:43:16 —really following the Bible’s counsel in their lives.
00:43:20 We don’t just conduct a study,
00:43:22 see them progress, get baptized,
00:43:24 and then say, “OK, see you later.”
00:43:26 It doesn’t work like that. They become part of our life.
00:43:33 He’s been my friend since before I got baptized.
00:43:35 It’s been about 28 years now.
00:43:38 Years ago, my former student Abel had a really difficult time.
00:43:42 His wife got sick.
00:43:45 Although we were far away when we heard about it,
00:43:48 we kept in touch with him.
00:43:53 “Thank you, Livingston family,
00:43:55 “for calling Jessica during these hard times.
00:43:59 It’s very encouraging to us.”
00:44:01 “I know that you love us, and we also love you very much.
00:44:06 “You are an example in true worship for us.
00:44:10 May Jehovah continue caring for you and blessing you.”
00:44:22 I got baptized 34 years ago
00:44:24 and have been pioneering for 33 years.
00:44:29 My Bible teacher was Schera.
00:44:32 She was diagnosed with cancer.
00:44:35 When I got sick,  Jehovah used Mercedes to help me.
00:44:41 After all this time, since I helped
00:44:44 her learn the truth, now she comforts me.
00:44:48 It’s a father-son relationship.
00:44:51 At some point,
00:44:53 maybe this student will help me.
00:44:55 And we can say that ‘we are good-for-nothing slaves,
00:44:58 and we have done what we ought to have done.’
00:45:02 And they keep loving and serving Jehovah.
00:45:04 What’s better than that?
00:45:12 To expand their ministry,
00:45:14 many of Jehovah’s Witnesses have learned a new language.
00:45:18 Have you?
00:45:20 Teaching someone the truth
00:45:22 in the language of their heart can be rewarding.
00:45:26 But learning to speak and think
00:45:28 in a new language can also be tough.
00:45:32 In a recent morning worship,
00:45:34 Brother William Malenfant offered some practical suggestions.
00:45:40 Usually,
00:45:41 the language that we learned
00:45:43 from infancy becomes
00:45:45 the language of the heart,
00:45:47 and we learn it at home.
00:45:50 In most cases, the dominant influence
00:45:53 in our life in connection with our language of the heart,
00:45:56 or the first language, is our mother.
00:45:59 And that’s precisely what took place
00:46:02 in Israel in the days of Nehemiah.
00:46:05 But the mothers in this case were pagans
00:46:07 sharing their language and probably their beliefs with their children.
00:46:12 And a lot of Jewish men —prominent Jewish men—
00:46:15 had married pagan women.
00:46:18 Let’s read the scripture together
00:46:20 at Nehemiah 13:23, 24
00:46:28 —Nehemiah 13:23, 24.
00:46:31 It says: “In those days I also saw Jews
00:46:35 “who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite,
00:46:38 “and Moabite women.
00:46:40 “Half of their sons were speaking Ashdodite
00:46:44 “and half spoke the language of the different peoples,
00:46:46 “but none of them
00:46:48 knew how to speak the language of the Jews.”
00:46:53 And as was stated, it’s very likely that those mothers
00:46:58 would be teaching the children
00:47:00 about their land, their culture,
00:47:02 their worship, and the pagan gods they worshipped.
00:47:05 And so the decision was made
00:47:08 by the Jews themselves,
00:47:10 when they were counseled and given direction
00:47:13 from Ezra and from Nehemiah,
00:47:15 to send those wives away along with the children.
00:47:20 And that’s an interesting thing.
00:47:21 It must have been a bit difficult
00:47:23 for some husbands to see their children sent away.
00:47:26 But all they knew were the languages of the pagan wives
00:47:30 —nothing about Hebrew and the worship of Jehovah God.
00:47:33 And the problem was that they were sent away to keep the Jews
00:47:36 from losing their identity by a gradual assimilation into the cultures
00:47:41 and the religions of the surrounding nations that those wives belonged to.
00:47:47 In Nehemiah’s day, speaking Hebrew was vital,
00:47:51 and we’re grateful it’s not necessary today.
00:47:54 We all don’t have to learn Hebrew.
00:47:56 But in his wisdom, Jehovah invites people who speak any language
00:48:01 to learn the “pure language,” the truth about him and his purposes.
00:48:06 And, you know, it’s a bit like the opposite
00:48:09 of what took place at the Tower of Babel,
00:48:11 where Jehovah intervened and confused the builders of the Tower of Babel,
00:48:16 imposing upon them different languages, including different ways of thinking.
00:48:20 And so they went off disorganized and separated from one another.
00:48:25 And today, we have people from all over the world
00:48:28 who speak many, many different languages,
00:48:30 but in Jehovah’s wisdom,
00:48:32 he’s bringing them all together
00:48:34 —those who love the truth and love him— in unity.
00:48:37 And this is what Zephaniah says —Zephaniah 3:9.
00:48:41 It speaks of the “pure language”:
00:48:44 “I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language,
00:48:49 in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah.”
00:48:52 And that’s what these people do who speak other languages.
00:48:55 We reach them with the truth, but then they’re unified
00:48:58 with Jehovah’s organization,
00:49:00 because it goes on to say “in order to serve him
00:49:03 shoulder to shoulder.”
00:49:05 So isn’t that interesting—the way Jehovah has used the “pure language”
00:49:10 to bring people of many diverse backgrounds
00:49:13 and languages together in his worship?
00:49:17 In our day, people of many different languages
00:49:19 are leaving their home countries to live elsewhere.
00:49:22 And it’s really quite amazing when you consider:
00:49:24 Large cities are filled with people
00:49:27 of different languages, and even in little villages,
00:49:30 we find people speaking different languages.
00:49:33 They need help to learn the truth
00:49:36 in the language of their heart.
00:49:42 It’s interesting to note how many Bethelites
00:49:44 have learned other languages in order to teach the truth to people.
00:49:49 In the United States Bethel, in our branch,
00:49:53 there are over 2,500 Bethelites
00:49:57 who are engaged
00:50:00 in 24 different language groups and congregations.
00:50:03 So a lot of Bethelites (and commuters are included in those numbers)
00:50:08 are doing a very fine work
00:50:10 in helping people in the territory to learn the truth.
00:50:13 And wouldn’t it be nice— I know some of us would love to learn some other languages
00:50:17 —wouldn’t it be lovely if we could learn the way a child does?
00:50:20 They just absorb it —no effort—
00:50:22 and they start speaking it.
00:50:24 A researcher, Dr. John Brierley, says this:
00:50:28 “‘Clearly the young brain seems
00:50:30 “to be programmed almost like a computer’
00:50:33 “for language development.
00:50:35 “He notes that even ‘brain anatomy’ suggests
00:50:38 “‘that an infant is born
00:50:40 with a pre-programmed biological capacity to speak.’”
00:50:45 And then the comment in Awake!  said
00:50:48 that it’s as though the brain is hardwired
00:50:50 to learn language.
00:50:52 I’m sorry to say that as the years go by,
00:50:56 the hardwiring starts to fray a bit in many of us.
00:51:02 But if we make the effort
00:51:06 and we do make a switch to a congregation where they speak the language
00:51:10 that you would like to learn, remember this:
00:51:14 Children can be a big help in the congregation
00:51:16 that you attend in a foreign language.
00:51:19 They can also be very startling and frank:
00:51:22 “You speak funny.
00:51:24 “Why can’t you pronounce that word properly?
00:51:27 It’s so easy.”
00:51:28 ‘Well, yes, to you  it’s easy.
00:51:30 You were raised with it.’
00:51:31 But that’s how kids are.
00:51:33 They don’t realize the difficulties we have
00:51:35 as we get older,  with the grooves being so deep
00:51:38 and so thick in the brain with our original language
00:51:41 that it’s hard to get out of those grooves the vowels and consonants
00:51:44 that we’re not used  to saying in a certain order.
00:51:49 Keep a sense of humor; listen to the kids.
00:51:53 They’ll help you.
00:51:54 And don’t be overly concerned
00:51:56 about speaking a new language without an accent.
00:52:01 Everybody has an accent one way or another.
00:52:04 Some are more agreeable than others, but everyone has that.
00:52:07 And some don’t want to admit it, but they really do.
00:52:10 They have an accent.
00:52:11 Even when we all speak the same language, you can tell where a person is from
00:52:15 —whether it’s east, north, west (whatever it may be), south.
00:52:19 There are accents or intonations in the way words are pronounced.
00:52:23 I remember, in years gone by, for missionaries
00:52:25 who were sent out into the field,
00:52:28 we had to follow a special program in learning a new language.
00:52:31 Your first month in your new assignment,
00:52:33 you had to study 11 hours a day
00:52:36 for 30 days your new language.
00:52:39 Well, you felt like you were in the Tower of Babel
00:52:42 on those occasions because it was very difficult.
00:52:44 The second month, you had to study your new language
00:52:47 four hours a day and be out preaching 130 hours.
00:52:50 Your third month was 150 hours in the field ministry,
00:52:54 and you’d study the language as you could.
00:52:57 For those who are striving to learn a new language,
00:53:00 here are a few suggestions I gleaned from the Awake!  of March 2007
00:53:04 and the January issue of 2000.
00:53:08 There are four points:
00:53:10 (1) motivation,
00:53:12 (2) humility,
00:53:14 (3) patience,
00:53:16 (4) practice.
00:53:18 “Motivation.
00:53:20 You need an incentive —a reason to pursue your goal.”
00:53:23 Because if you have a high level of motivation,
00:53:26 you’re going to be more successful.
00:53:28 Well, we have the best motivation there is:
00:53:30 teach people the truth; praise our God, Jehovah;
00:53:33 build up the congregation we’ve chosen to attend.
00:53:37 What about humility?
00:53:39 Well, “don’t expect too much of yourself” when you start learning a new language.
00:53:44 “Mistakes are inevitable.”
00:53:46 And if you wait until you can speak it perfectly
00:53:49 before you start making comments or give a talk,
00:53:53 you may be waiting quite a while.
00:53:55 Be prepared, because it may not be
00:53:57 until after Armageddon that you achieve that goal.
00:54:00 So don’t be afraid to make mistakes and carry on with your new language.
00:54:05 ‘Patience.
00:54:07 ‘A brother stated: “For me, the first two years were difficult,
00:54:11 ‘and at times I felt like giving up.”
00:54:13 ‘Still, he acknowledges
00:54:15 that it does get easier as time goes by.’
00:54:19 And it gets enjoyable.
00:54:21 And number four: “Practice.
00:54:23 “A regular routine will help you to become fluent in [your] new language.
00:54:28 “Try to practice every day, even if it’s for just a few minutes.
00:54:31 “[There’s an interesting saying] As one textbook puts it,
00:54:34 “‘“A little and often”
00:54:37 is preferable to “a lot but seldom.”’”
00:54:40 So be steady,
00:54:42 even for short periods of time, in practicing the new language.
00:54:47 Now, the fact is that most Bethelites in our branch
00:54:49 are serving in the English-language field,
00:54:52 and they are truly a blessing to their congregations.
00:54:56 The brothers are happy to have Bethelites who take the lead,
00:55:00 who give of themselves, and who work hard to build up the congregation.
00:55:04 So the decision to serve in an English congregation
00:55:07 or with a different language group is highly personal.
00:55:12 Whatever the decision may be, there’s a key factor
00:55:16 that we all have to keep in mind
00:55:18 to maintain our spirituality at a high level
00:55:21 and give our Bethel assignment our best.
00:55:25 And that key factor that we have to keep in mind
00:55:28 is to focus on the one language that counts the most
00:55:32 —the “pure language” that Jehovah God has given to his people.
00:55:38 As we noted earlier,
00:55:40 we can expect stormy tests
00:55:44 and trials to come our way.
00:55:46 But if we’ve built fire-resistant materials
00:55:50 in our children, our students, and ourselves
00:55:53 —we will stand firm.
00:55:56 We’ll see that in our beautiful new music video.
00:56:10 The first time I heard the word of truth
00:56:18 About Jehovah and a world that is new,
00:56:25 Love grew in my heart right up to this day.
00:56:33 But I know this world wants to pull me away.
00:56:43 I cannot lose sight.
00:56:51 I want to do what is right.
00:56:57 I’ll keep building my faith so I can be strong.
00:57:02 I will not give up or give in.
00:57:06 His Word as my guide I’ll follow each day.
00:57:10 I’ll pray to stand firm on the ground.
00:57:14 I’ll keep building my faith; I won’t stop now.
00:57:26 So we have to choose where we will stand:
00:57:34 A life built on rock or one built on sand.
00:57:41 This world around us wants us to believe
00:57:48 It will stand forever, so live and be free.
00:57:59 But we know the truth,
00:58:07 What the Kingdom will do.
00:58:12 Let’s keep building our faith so we can be strong.
00:58:17 We will not give up or give in.
00:58:21 His Word as our guide we’ll follow each day.
00:58:26 We’ll pray to stand firm on the ground.
00:58:29 Let’s keep building our faith; we won’t stop now.
00:58:50 Let’s keep building our faith so we can be strong.
00:58:55 We will not give up or give in.
00:58:58 His Word as our guide we’ll follow each day.
00:59:03 We’ll pray to stand firm on the ground.
00:59:07 Let’s keep building our faith; we won’t stop now.
00:59:15 We won’t stop now.
00:59:19 We won’t stop now.
00:59:33 What an encouraging song!
00:59:36 And to further help you  stand firm against trials,
00:59:41 a new video will be released
00:59:43 later this month entitled
00:59:46 Firm Under Opposition.
00:59:49 This 10-minute video consists of segments
00:59:52 from two previous documentaries
00:59:55 that touched the hearts of many:
00:59:57 Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault
01:00:02 and Faithful Under Trials
01:00:05 —Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union.
01:00:09 So please look for this video that combines the highlights
01:00:13 of the two previous programs.
01:00:16 It will strengthen
01:00:18 and help you remain faithful to Jehovah.
01:00:23 The theme of this month’s program was
01:00:26 “Let Each One Keep Watching How He Is Building.”
01:00:31 We saw how first-time parents
01:00:35 can successfully embrace their new responsibilities.
01:00:40 By setting a good example, Rudy and Nenita
01:00:43 helped their three daughters reach meaningful, spiritual goals.
01:00:48 Louise received fine training from her parents,
01:00:51 which has helped her to enjoy a fulfilling life.
01:00:58 Cecilio and Schera
01:00:59 made sacrifices to be effective
01:01:02 Bible teachers, and their efforts made
01:01:04 a real difference in the lives of their students.
01:01:10 Before we close,
01:01:12 let’s visit our brothers  and sisters in Nigeria.
01:01:17 Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa.
01:01:21 Its some 200 million people
01:01:23 speak over 500 languages.
01:01:26 More than 400,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses
01:01:29 live and preach there.
01:01:31 Many publishers come from other lands to share in the ministry.
01:01:36 The response to the good news is very encouraging.
01:01:40 More than 870,000 Bible studies
01:01:44 are conducted every month.
01:01:46 On average, about 40 people are baptized every day,
01:01:51 and seven new congregations
01:01:53 are formed every month.
01:01:56 This is the Obudu Ranch Congregation.
01:01:59 Their territory is beautiful, vast, and mountainous
01:02:04 —literally in the clouds.
01:02:06 Twenty-three publishers,
01:02:08 including two special pioneers, serve here.
01:02:12 To reach areas only accessible by foot,
01:02:16 the publishers sometimes walk for eight hours.
01:02:19 The terrain is challenging, but the long walk
01:02:23 provides opportunities for upbuilding association.
01:02:27 After working the territory, our brothers
01:02:29 stay overnight and walk back
01:02:32 another eight hours.
01:02:36 Our brothers and sisters in the Obudu Ranch Congregation
01:02:39 send their warm love and greetings!
01:02:43 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:02:46 this is JW Broadcasting.

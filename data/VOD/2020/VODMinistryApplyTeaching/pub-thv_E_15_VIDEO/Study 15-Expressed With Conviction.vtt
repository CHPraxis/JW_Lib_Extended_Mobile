00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we speak with conviction?

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our conviction can convey,

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more powerfully than words alone,

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we really feel about our message.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 1:5,
the apostle Paul wrote:

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The good news we preach
did not come to you with speech alone

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but . . . with strong conviction.”

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we show that we’re convinced

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:41.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the good news of God’s Kingdom
is the most valuable message we could share?

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First,

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we prepare thoroughly.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:51.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we convince ourselves
of the value of our message.

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second,

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we choose words that convey our conviction.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally,

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we express ourselves
earnestly and sincerely.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would you express yourself if you
were giving a talk about the resurrection?

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch an example.

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus resurrected Lazarus.

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can that Bible account help us?

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we have lost loved ones in death,

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can put our trust in the resurrection.

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speaker is correct,

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but did he express firm conviction?

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not really.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn how
to express ourselves with conviction

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:45.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jesus and Martha
in this very Bible account.

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 11:23 records Jesus’ words:

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:52.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your brother will rise.”

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With these words,
Jesus expressed complete conviction.

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, verse 24 records Martha’s reply:

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know he will rise
in the resurrection on the last day.”

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha, too, expressed her firm conviction.

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now give our brother another chance.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus resurrected Lazarus.

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:21.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does this Bible account help us?

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when loved ones fall asleep in death,

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know we’ll see them again.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is as sure as the sun rising each day.

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will awaken our dear loved ones
to life in Paradise.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a difference!

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did the speaker
express himself earnestly

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:48.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he chose words that showed
his firm belief in the resurrection hope.

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we express
similar conviction in the ministry?

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:02:56.697 --> 00:03:01.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is especially important
when our faith is challenged.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine, for instance, that a schoolmate,

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a teacher, or a workmate expresses surprise

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you don’t join in a certain celebration.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you respond?

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re coming
to the Christmas party next week, right?

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh.
I don’t think I can make it.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody’s going to be there.

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m kind of busy.

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Plus, I’d feel out of place.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t celebrate Christmas.

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister wasn’t prepared to address

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:39.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a common situation during the holiday season.

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With more preparation,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she could have responded with conviction.

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:46.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:50.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re coming
to the Christmas party next week, right?

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I appreciate the invitation,
I won’t be going.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You won’t be going?

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody’s going to be there.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve made a personal decision
not to celebrate Christmas.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?
Why?

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:06.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve learned through a study of the Bible

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:11.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus wasn’t really born in December

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Christmas
is based on unscriptural customs and ideas.

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:19.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have just a moment,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to show you a web article

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that discusses the origin
of some Christmas customs.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:26.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our sister spoke with conviction,

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:33.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she actually piqued
the interest of her coworker.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:36.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
expressing ourselves with conviction

00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should not be confused with being tactless,

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:41.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opinionated, or pushy.

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:46.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By appealing to our listeners
in a loving manner

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed with conviction,

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:53.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will draw still others to the glorious
good news found in God’s Word.

00:00:10 Toward the end of his life,
00:00:12 Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel
00:00:16 and gave a moving farewell speech.
00:00:19 In it, he recounted how Jehovah protected them.
00:00:24 Listen to his conclusion
00:00:26 as recorded at Joshua 24:14, 15:
00:00:32 “Therefore, fear Jehovah
00:00:35 “and serve him with integrity and faithfulness,
00:00:38 “and remove the gods that your forefathers served
00:00:41 “on the other side of the River and in Egypt,
00:00:44 “and serve Jehovah.
00:00:47 “Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah,
00:00:51 “choose for yourselves today whom you will serve,
00:00:55 “whether the gods that your forefathers served
00:00:57 “on the other side of the River
00:00:59 “or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling.
00:01:03 “But as for me and my household,
00:01:06 we will serve Jehovah.”
00:01:10 Did Joshua motivate his listeners?
00:01:14 Verse 16 says:
00:01:16 “At this the people answered:
00:01:19 “‘It is unthinkable for us to abandon Jehovah
00:01:23 and to serve other gods.’”
00:01:26 Verse 31 adds
00:01:29 that “Israel continued to serve Jehovah
00:01:32 “all the days of Joshua
00:01:34 and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua.”
00:01:39 This teaches us something
00:01:42 about how we can conclude a discussion effectively.
00:01:46 Our final words should connect to the overall topic,
00:01:51 motivate our listeners, and be simple and brief.
00:01:56 Let’s watch the following conclusion of a public talk.
00:02:01 So, brothers, during these “critical times hard to deal with,”
00:02:04 let’s follow the counsel in today’s talk,
00:02:06 because with Jehovah’s help, we can endure life’s challenges.
00:02:09 And when he brings an end to this world and all its problems,
00:02:12 we’ll survive to live forever in a beautiful Paradise.
00:02:16 What do you think?
00:02:18 Did the speaker connect his conclusion to the overall topic?
00:02:22 Could you identify the theme
00:02:25 of his talk from this conclusion?
00:02:28 And while it’s good that the speaker
00:02:30 tried to motivate his audience,
00:02:33 was he specific?
00:02:35 Did he speak with a note of finality?
00:02:39 Let’s give him another chance.
00:02:42 So, brothers, although we live “in times of distress,”
00:02:46 may we always remember how Jehovah helps us.
00:02:50 He offers us his powerful holy spirit,
00:02:53 he provides support through our loving Christian brotherhood,
00:02:57 and he gives us a hope.
00:03:00 Therefore, when facing trials,
00:03:03 let’s ‘throw our burdens on Jehovah,’
00:03:05 confident that ‘he will sustain us.’
00:03:09 This time, the speaker rephrased the theme
00:03:13 “Where Can You Get Help in Times of Distress?”
00:03:16 and he restated the talk’s three main points.
00:03:21 He motivated his listeners by reminding them
00:03:25 how to benefit from Jehovah’s provisions.
00:03:29 His conclusion was simple and brief.
00:03:35 How might we apply these principles in the ministry?
00:03:40 In the following example,
00:03:42 a brother named Aaron is talking to a workmate named Mark,
00:03:47 who recently attended his grandfather’s funeral.
00:03:51 Aaron sees an opportunity to witness informally,
00:03:55 so he tells Mark about the resurrection
00:03:59 and shows him John 5:28, 29.
00:04:03 Now, how might Aaron
00:04:06 effectively conclude their conversation?
00:04:10 So Jesus promises to resurrect those who’ve died.
00:04:13 Interesting.
00:04:18 Well, I guess we’d better get back to work.
00:04:23 Not much of a conclusion, was it?
00:04:26 Let’s watch him try again.
00:04:29 So Jesus promises to resurrect those who’ve died.
00:04:35 Interesting.
00:04:37 What do you think that promise means for your grandfather?
00:04:43 In his conclusion,
00:04:45 Aaron connected the topic of their conversation
00:04:49 to the death of Mark’s grandfather.
00:04:52 But a good conclusion should also motivate your listeners
00:04:57 and show them what to do with the information they learned.
00:05:01 Let’s watch the rest of Aaron’s conclusion.
00:05:06 So, Mark, during those times
00:05:08 when your grandfather’s death makes you especially sad,
00:05:11 think about Jesus’ promise that death is not the end.
00:05:16 Imagine what it’ll be like to see your grandfather again.
00:05:20 That helps me when I’m sad about relatives I’ve lost in death.
00:05:23 Thanks for sharing that.
00:05:25 Sure.
00:05:27 Maybe when we talk next time, I’ll show you what Jesus said about . . .
00:05:33 Well done!
00:05:35 After repeating the main point for Mark to remember,
00:05:39 Aaron motivated him to reflect
00:05:42 on the resurrection hope during times of sadness.
00:05:46 Aaron could have also tried
00:05:48 to motivate Mark to accept a Bible study,
00:05:52 to come with him to a congregation meeting,
00:05:54 or some other specific action.
00:05:57 When your conclusion is effective,
00:06:01 your audience will remember your theme and main points
00:06:06 and be motivated to apply what they learned.

Why is it so important to help our listeners

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:16.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grasp the meaning of our message?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul reasoned on the matter

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 14:9:

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless you with the tongue

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“use speech that is easily understood,

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how will anyone know what is being said?

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:33.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will, in fact, be speaking into the air.”

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we’d be wasting our time.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How, then, can we make our speech
understandable to others?

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must understand our topic well,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use simple expressions,

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explain unfamiliar terms.

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following scenario,
identify the expressions

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are common to us
as Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that are not common
to people in general.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to give you
this invitation to our regional convention.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful event organized each year

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like our circuit assemblies but larger.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy it so much!

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can really sense God’s spirit there.

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really helps us to serve Jehovah

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:21.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to get
the best theocratic teaching there is.

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:25.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um . . . maybe not.
It doesn’t sound like it’s for me.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, OK.
Maybe next time.

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the householder
readily understand the expressions

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“regional convention,”

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“faithful and discreet slave,”

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“circuit assembly,” “God’s spirit,”

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:41.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even “Jehovah”

00:01:41.914 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “theocratic teaching”?

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not likely.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give the brother another chance.

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to give you this invitation
to a special event being held next month.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year,
it’s going to be at the Event Center.

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone in the community is invited,
and it’s free of charge.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program moves quickly
with talks, interviews, and short films.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year, there’s a movie
that recounts the story of . . .

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the publisher kept it simple

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and piqued the householder’s curiosity.

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:17.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about when we fulfill
a speaking assignment in the congregation?

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to think in advance
about our audience.

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have a conversation assignment
on the midweek meeting,

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should use expressions
that a householder will be familiar with.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re giving a public talk,
it shouldn’t sound like a local needs part.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following example,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identify which kind of talk is being given

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a public talk or a local needs part.

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a witness to all the nations,
and then the end will come.”

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:59.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends,
what does that verse mean to you personally?

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us should ask himself:

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:06.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I having a full share
in this never-to-be-repeated work?

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can I arrange my circumstances

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to serve as an auxiliary pioneer

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or a regular pioneer?

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I preach with a sense of urgency?

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I doing my best 

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make return visits
and conduct Bible studies?’

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you identify it as a local needs part?

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were some clues?

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speaker used expressions

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that aren’t always familiar to non-Witnesses:

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“friends,” “auxiliary pioneer,”

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“regular pioneer,” and “return visits.”

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now how might you apply Matthew 24:14

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:49.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an audience that includes non-Witnesses?

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:53.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a witness to all the nations,
and then the end will come.”

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about God’s Kingdom

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:07.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one way that we can do good to others.

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if we’ve just begun to learn
the truth from the Bible,

00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can share what we’ve learned
with relatives or workmates.

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, 
we may even help them

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gain everlasting life!

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured that Jehovah God
will bless and reward

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:28.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goodness you show to others.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:33.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By helping our listeners to grasp
the meaning of our message,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be a joy to listen to

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our audience will clearly understand
what they need to do.

00:00:10 At Hebrews 8:1, the apostle Paul wrote:
00:00:14 “Now this is the main point of what we are saying.”
00:00:18 When we teach, we want our main points to stand out.
00:00:23 Why?
00:00:24 Well, which is easier to listen to?
00:00:26 A rambling discourse that outlines seemingly unrelated facts
00:00:31 or an organized presentation
00:00:34 with main points that relate to the theme?
00:00:37 When we make our main points stand out,
00:00:40 we help our audience to pay attention,
00:00:43 understand, and remember what we say.
00:00:48 So how can you make the main points stand out?
00:00:53 First, decide on the objective of your talk.
00:00:57 Aim to accomplish something.
00:00:59 If you don’t know your objective, neither will your audience.
00:01:03 Do you want to inform, convince,
00:01:07 encourage, motivate, or something else?
00:01:12 For example, let’s say that you’re discussing the resurrection.
00:01:17 If you’re speaking to a grieving family  made up of fellow Christians,
00:01:22 your objective may be to give encouragement and comfort.
00:01:26 On the other hand, if you’re speaking about the resurrection
00:01:29 to unbelieving relatives who have questioned your beliefs,
00:01:33 your objective might be to convince them.
00:01:37 In each instance, the main points you choose will be different
00:01:42 because the objective is different.
00:01:44 So when preparing,
00:01:46 select only main points that help you achieve your objective
00:01:50 and that you can teach effectively in the allotted time.
00:01:54 Then develop the points in a logical order.
00:01:58 Ask yourself:
00:02:00 ‘What questions or objections might my audience have about this topic?
00:02:06 In what logical order would they raise those questions or objections?’
00:02:13 Often, however, we are given an outline to develop,
00:02:18 and the main points have already been selected and put in a certain order.
00:02:22 In such a case,
00:02:24 analyze the outline to have clearly in mind
00:02:28 the objective of the talk
00:02:30 and how the main points will help you to reach that objective.
00:02:34 As you give the talk,
00:02:36 you don’t want the audience to lose sight of your theme.
00:02:39 So at various times during your discourse,
00:02:42 repeat key words in the theme or use synonyms.
00:02:48 Your audience will remember only a few main points,
00:02:51 so don’t develop too many.
00:02:54 Even if you’re giving a longer talk,
00:02:56 focus on developing a few points well.
00:03:01 As you develop secondary points,
00:03:03 explain their connection to the main point.
00:03:07 Don’t add ideas just because they’re interesting.
00:03:10 To make your main points stand out,
00:03:13 you might repeat in a sentence or two
00:03:16 each main point before going on to the next.
00:03:19 Or you might state the main points in the introduction
00:03:23 and then restate them in the conclusion.
00:03:26 When you finish,
00:03:28 the audience should be able to remember the main points.
00:03:33 Let’s watch a brother who’s in the middle of giving a talk.
00:03:37 See if you can discern the main point he’s developing and his theme.
00:03:43 Let’s turn to Proverbs 28:1.
00:03:47 Here the righteous are compared to a very impressive animal.
00:03:52 “The wicked flee when no one pursues them,
00:03:56 but the righteous are as confident as a lion.”
00:04:01 You and I can be like a lion.
00:04:03 Imagine that!
00:04:05 Bible writers were familiar with lions
00:04:08 because they were once plentiful in Israel,
00:04:10 although they are now extinct there.
00:04:13 A lion’s thunderous roar can be heard for miles.
00:04:17 They can move at a speed of 40 miles per hour.
00:04:21 They are so powerful
00:04:24 that a single blow from a lion’s paw
00:04:26 is enough to break the neck of a small antelope.
00:04:30 According to Insight on the Scriptures,
00:04:32 the lion serves as a fitting symbol of courageous justice.
00:04:37 And so Jesus is called
00:04:39 “the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah.”
00:04:44 Could you tell from that talk what the theme is?
00:04:48 Is it something about lions?
00:04:50 Jesus? the righteous?
00:04:53 Actually, the theme of this talk is
00:04:56 “Jehovah Makes Us Bold.”
00:04:59 What’s the main point that the speaker is trying to develop?
00:05:03 Jehovah is the Source of true boldness.
00:05:07 Let’s watch the speaker try again.
00:05:10 This time, notice how he emphasizes
00:05:13 the theme and main point.
00:05:17 Let’s turn to Proverbs 28:1.
00:05:19 As we read this verse, look for the answer to this question:
00:05:23 What sort of people can be truly confident?
00:05:29 “The wicked flee when no one pursues them,
00:05:32 but the righteous are as confident as a lion.”
00:05:38 So who can be confident?
00:05:41 The righteous.
00:05:43 And who are the righteous?
00:05:46 Those who have faith in the ransom
00:05:49 and who strive to adhere to Jehovah’s requirements.
00:05:54 Here’s the point:
00:05:56 Confidence comes not from natural ability,
00:06:00 education, or riches;
00:06:03 the source of true boldness
00:06:05 is our relationship with Jehovah.
00:06:09 So when we go in the ministry, we don’t need to be afraid.
00:06:14 We’re doing what Jehovah requires, and Jehovah is supporting us.
00:06:19 Remembering this will help us to preach with boldness.
00:06:25 This time, the speaker introduced the scripture in a way
00:06:28 that called attention to the main point.
00:06:31 He avoided cluttering his talk with details that didn’t support his point.
00:06:36 And to make sure the audience got the main point,
00:06:39 he told them, “Here’s the point.”
00:06:42 Then, he connected the point to the theme.
00:06:47 Whether from the platform or in the ministry,
00:06:49 our teaching should be simple and clear.
00:06:53 If we group our thoughts under just a few main points
00:06:56 that relate to our objective and theme,
00:06:59 our presentation will be easy to follow
00:07:02 and hard to forget.

00:00:02 Are you paying attention?
00:00:05 Perhaps you’ve been asked that question
00:00:07 by your parents, a teacher,
00:00:09 or someone else in authority.
00:00:12 It’s a good question for each of us to ask ourselves.
00:00:17 Can you think of occasions associated with our worship
00:00:20 that require us to pay special attention?
00:00:25 For example, when reading the Bible, attending meetings,
00:00:30 elders when shepherding,
00:00:32 you children when being instructed by your parents.
00:00:36 We want to pay attention,
00:00:38 and yet there are so many distractions
00:00:42 —electronic gadgets,
00:00:44 the conversations and activities of those around us.
00:00:48 Truly, it can be a challenge to pay attention.
00:00:53 Did you know that the phrase “pay attention”
00:00:56 occurs dozens of times in the New World Translation?
00:01:01 In many of those occurrences,
00:01:03 Jehovah is instructing his people to pay attention.
00:01:09 What does it mean to “pay attention”?
00:01:11 And how important is it
00:01:13 that you and I pay attention to Jehovah?
00:01:18 The account in 1 Samuel chapter 15
00:01:21 will help us to answer those questions.
00:01:25 In verse 3, Jehovah instructs King Saul
00:01:28 to strike down the Amalekites
00:01:31 and to devote them and everything they have to destruction.
00:01:36 However, verses 8 and 9 tell us
00:01:40 that Saul did not obey.
00:01:43 He spared the king of Amalek
00:01:45 and the best of the animals.
00:01:49 How did Saul respond
00:01:51 when Samuel confronted him?
00:01:55 As we read verses 13-15,
00:01:58 note how Saul tried to justify his disobedience:
00:02:04 “When Samuel finally came to him,
00:02:07 “Saul said to him:
00:02:09 “‘May Jehovah bless you.
00:02:11 “I have carried out the word of Jehovah.’
00:02:15 “But Samuel said:
00:02:17 “‘Then what is this sound of the flock in my ears
00:02:21 “and the sound of the cattle that I hear?’
00:02:24 “To this Saul said:
00:02:26 “‘They were brought from the Amalekites,
00:02:29 “‘because the people spared the best of the flock and the herd
00:02:33 “‘for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God;
00:02:37 but what was left we devoted to destruction.’”
00:02:42 Did you notice?
00:02:44 Saul attempted to justify his disobedience,
00:02:49 claiming that the animals would be sacrificed to Jehovah.
00:02:55 Was Jehovah pleased with Saul?
00:02:58 As we read verse 22,
00:03:00 please note the connection between paying attention
00:03:04 and obedience:
00:03:08 “Samuel then said:
00:03:10 “‘Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices
00:03:15 “‘as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?
00:03:19 “‘Look!
00:03:21 “‘To obey is better than a sacrifice,
00:03:25 and to pay attention than the fat of rams.’”
00:03:30 What was one of the causes of Saul’s disobedience?
00:03:35 He didn’t pay attention to Jehovah’s instructions.
00:03:39 His failure to pay attention resulted in disobedience
00:03:43 and brought Jehovah’s disapproval.
00:03:47 What a powerful lesson for us!
00:03:50 As happened with Saul,
00:03:52 our worship could become unacceptable to Jehovah
00:03:56 if we fail to pay attention!
00:04:00 Now that we understand why it is important to pay attention,
00:04:05 let’s consider three aspects of paying attention
00:04:09 that are discussed in the Bible.
00:04:12 The first scripture we’ll consider
00:04:14 is 2 Chronicles 19:6:
00:04:20 “And he [Jehoshaphat] said to the judges:
00:04:25 “‘Pay attention to what you are doing,
00:04:30 “‘for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah,
00:04:34 and he is with you when you pass judgment.’”
00:04:39 This admonition to “pay attention”
00:04:43 was given by King Jehoshaphat
00:04:45 to appointed judges throughout the land of Judah.
00:04:49 What a sobering reminder!
00:04:52 Those judges had good reason
00:04:54 to pay attention to what they were doing.
00:04:58 Why?
00:04:59 They were responsible to Jehovah.
00:05:02 They represented him,
00:05:04 and their decisions affected the lives of fellow worshippers.
00:05:09 Thus, they needed to be familiar with Jehovah’s thinking on matters
00:05:14 and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint
00:05:17 when handling matters.
00:05:19 This is an excellent reminder for those who serve as elders.
00:05:24 Good elders are good students of the Bible
00:05:27 and Bible-based publications.
00:05:29 Why?
00:05:31 Their attentiveness to Jehovah
00:05:34 enables them to pay attention to what they are doing.
00:05:39 If they are going to represent Jehovah
00:05:41 and reflect his thinking accurately as they handle matters
00:05:45 —whether they’re shepherding the congregation,
00:05:48 delivering a part at a meeting,
00:05:50 caring for a challenging assignment,
00:05:53 or addressing wrongdoing
00:05:56 —they must pay attention to what they are doing.
00:06:00 That is why they must be familiar with Jehovah’s thinking
00:06:03 and then take care to follow his direction.
00:06:07 If they do, they show that they are paying attention
00:06:11 to what they are doing.
00:06:14 Jehovah’s interest in assisting the elders
00:06:17 is demonstrated in the ongoing education he provides.
00:06:21 Each time the circuit overseer visits the congregation,
00:06:25 he presents material prepared especially for the elders.
00:06:30 The Kingdom Ministry School and the School for Congregation Elders
00:06:35 provide more intensive instruction.
00:06:38 How important
00:06:39 that elders pay close attention to
00:06:42 and apply such instruction!
00:06:45 Their doing so protects, not just themselves
00:06:49 but also fellow worshippers.
00:06:52 By paying attention, elders will be able
00:06:55 to convey direction to the congregations accurately.
00:07:00 This can be especially important if our worship is banned
00:07:04 or restricted in the event of a natural disaster
00:07:08 or other catastrophic event.
00:07:11 This brings us to the second aspect of paying attention
00:07:15 that we’ll consider.
00:07:17 Let’s read Luke 8:18:
00:07:21 “Therefore,
00:07:24 “pay attention to how you listen,
00:07:29 “for whoever has will be given more,
00:07:32 “but whoever does not have,
00:07:34 even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”
00:07:40 What did Jesus mean when he said:
00:07:43 “Pay attention to how you listen”?
00:07:47 Those in Jesus’ audience in the first century
00:07:51 had the wonderful privilege of hearing Jesus’ literal voice
00:07:55 as he instructed them.
00:07:57 Of course, we can’t hear the voice of Jesus today,
00:08:02 but we can read his words and learn of his actions
00:08:06 as revealed in the Gospel accounts.
00:08:09 In fact, we have many opportunities to listen
00:08:13 to Jehovah, Jesus,
00:08:16 “the faithful and discreet slave,”
00:08:19 the elders in our congregation,
00:08:22 our marriage mate,
00:08:24 and our children.
00:08:26 No wonder the Bible writer James stated
00:08:28 that “everyone must be quick to listen.”
00:08:33 Think about it:
00:08:35 If Saul had truly listened receptively
00:08:38 to Jehovah’s direction regarding the Amalekites,
00:08:41 he would likely have grasped the importance of the direction he received
00:08:46 and would have been motivated to obey.
00:08:50 However, his lack of attentiveness
00:08:52 led to disobedience and Jehovah’s disapproval.
00:08:58 If we don’t pay attention to how we listen,
00:09:01 we could find ourselves becoming critical
00:09:04 or unappreciative
00:09:06 or even disobedient.
00:09:10 So as Jehovah instructs and directs us,
00:09:14 we need to think about what we are being told,
00:09:17 ponder over its meaning,
00:09:19 mull it over in our mind and, most important,
00:09:23 apply the instruction in our own lives.
00:09:28 If you’re a young person,
00:09:30 how can you show that you’re paying attention
00:09:34 to how you listen?
00:09:36 Consider the admonition at Ephesians 6:1-3:
00:09:43 “Children, be obedient to your parents
00:09:47 “in union with the Lord,
00:09:49 “for this is righteous.
00:09:51 “‘Honor your father and your mother’
00:09:54 “is the first command with a promise:
00:09:57 “‘That it may go well with you
00:09:59 and you may remain a long time on the earth.’”
00:10:04 You children, who do you think is the source of this direction?
00:10:10 We know that these words come from Jehovah.
00:10:14 Did you notice that the verses state not only
00:10:18 that children should “be obedient” to their parents
00:10:22 but also that they should “honor” their parents?
00:10:28 How can you show that you’re paying attention
00:10:31 to how you listen to this direction?
00:10:35 When I was a boy, I can remember occasions
00:10:38 when my parents would ask me to do something,
00:10:41 perhaps to take out the trash.
00:10:44 I would always obey.
00:10:47 But at times, I’d make it very clear
00:10:49 that I didn’t really want to do what was asked.
00:10:53 I think you young ones know what I mean.
00:10:58 However, if we’re truly paying attention
00:11:01 to how we listen to Jehovah’s words,
00:11:04 we’ll be careful to honor our parents,
00:11:08 which is an essential element of obedience.
00:11:11 In this way, we contribute to the peace of the family,
00:11:16 and we make Jehovah’s heart glad.
00:11:20 Additionally, as the promise in verse 3 indicates,
00:11:25 paying attention to how you listen will protect you
00:11:29 and contribute to your success in other ways
00:11:32 throughout your adult life.
00:11:35 Of course, all of us should remember
00:11:38 that our everlasting welfare will depend
00:11:41 on our willingness to listen and obey.
00:11:45 How important, then, that all of us
00:11:48 pay attention to how we listen.
00:11:53 The third aspect of paying attention is found
00:11:56 at Luke 21:34, 35:
00:12:04 “But pay attention to yourselves
00:12:07 “that your hearts never become weighed down
00:12:10 “with overeating and heavy drinking
00:12:13 “and anxieties of life,
00:12:16 and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.”
00:12:23 When Jesus admonished his followers
00:12:25 to pay attention to themselves,
00:12:29 he didn’t have in mind the selfish thinking that characterized King Saul
00:12:33 and that’s so common, even encouraged, in today’s world.
00:12:39 Rather, Jesus’ words reveal
00:12:41 that the key to paying attention to ourselves
00:12:44 is knowing ourselves
00:12:47 —knowing what’s in our figurative heart.
00:12:51 This is a challenge for all of us.
00:12:54 Why?
00:12:55 The Bible explains at Jeremiah 17:9:
00:13:00 “The heart is more treacherous than anything else
00:13:04 “and is desperate.
00:13:06 Who can know it?”
00:13:10 Verse 10 answers:
00:13:12 “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart,
00:13:15 examining the innermost thoughts.”
00:13:19 So Jehovah knows what is in our heart,
00:13:23 and he can help us to know.
00:13:26 He can help us to examine our motives and goals
00:13:30 and to discern why we do certain things.
00:13:34 Carefully and honestly looking at ourselves in the mirror of God’s Word
00:13:39 can reveal areas in our thinking, words,
00:13:42 and actions
00:13:44 that need attention.
00:13:46 For example, some of Jehovah’s people
00:13:49 —including those of retirement age
00:13:51 who have enjoyed very comfortable circumstances—
00:13:55 have concluded that they needed to make adjustments in their lifestyle,
00:13:59 simplifying their lives
00:14:01 so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.
00:14:05 Some who have done so have had the privilege
00:14:08 of attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:14:12 Although it meant stepping out of their comfort zone,
00:14:15 perhaps moving to a new congregation,
00:14:19 they’ve experienced Jehovah’s blessing in ways that they couldn’t have anticipated
00:14:24 as they share the benefits of their experience
00:14:27 and theocratic education
00:14:29 in their new assignments.
00:14:32 How grateful we are
00:14:34 that Jehovah is providing ongoing, life-saving instruction
00:14:39 by means of his Word and organization.
00:14:42 May each of us be determined to “pay attention”
00:14:46 to what we are doing,
00:14:48 to how we listen,
00:14:50 and to ourselves.
00:14:53 By doing so, we’ll avoid falling into the trap of disobedience
00:14:58 as King Saul did.
00:15:00 Instead, as attentive and obedient servants,
00:15:05 we’ll enjoy Jehovah’s friendship forever.

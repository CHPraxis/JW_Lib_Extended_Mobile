00:00:01 To set the stage, we’d like to begin
00:00:03 with a few thoughts about the subject
00:00:05 “Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing.”
00:00:08 This is what we are told at Psalm 100:2.
00:00:12 But do you serve Jehovah with rejoicing all the time?
00:00:17 I guess we all will agree
00:00:19 that at times it can be difficult to be happy.
00:00:22 So, then, is it really important
00:00:26 to serve Jehovah with rejoicing?
00:00:28 And what does it really mean?
00:00:31 In other words, what is this joyful attitude
00:00:34 that Jehovah expects from us?
00:00:36 And what can we do to serve Jehovah
00:00:40 with rejoicing and maintain a joyful spirit?
00:00:46 How can we prove that it is important to serve Jehovah with rejoicing?
00:00:50 You might think of our goal, which is to reflect his personality.
00:00:55 At 1 Timothy 1:11, he’s called “the happy God.”
00:01:00 So isn’t it logical that Jehovah expects us
00:01:04 to be happy in his service?
00:01:07 In Deuteronomy chapter 28,
00:01:10 we find a report of God’s dealings with the Israelites.
00:01:14 Here Jehovah warned them of what would take place
00:01:18 if they became disobedient
00:01:20 and lost their joy in serving him.
00:01:25 We read at Deuteronomy chapter 28, beginning in verse 45:
00:01:30 “All these curses will certainly come upon you
00:01:34 “. . . because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God
00:01:38 “by keeping his commandments and . . .
00:01:41 “because you did not serve Jehovah your God
00:01:45 “with rejoicing and joy of heart
00:01:48 when you had such an abundance of everything.”
00:01:52 Jehovah took such good care of the Israelites,
00:01:55 and yet they were not happy.
00:01:58 This attitude was something he did not like at all.
00:02:02 So we see that serving Jehovah joyfully
00:02:06 is very important.
00:02:09 This was emphasized by what Jesus taught.
00:02:13 For example, in the Sermon on the Mount,
00:02:15 he helped his audience to understand
00:02:18 how to be happy.
00:02:21 At times, this part in Matthew chapter 5
00:02:23 is referred to as the nine happinesses.
00:02:28 Later, the apostle Paul wrote about “the fruitage of the spirit.”
00:02:33 Joy is counted among the aspects of the fruitage of the spirit.
00:02:38 Being joyful is important,
00:02:41 and by means of his spirit,
00:02:44 Jehovah helps us to rejoice in his service.
00:02:49 But is it realistic to expect
00:02:52 that we will smile all the time
00:02:55 and cheerfully sing songs the whole day?
00:02:58 Of course, this is not what Jehovah expects.
00:03:02 We all have different personalities and express our happiness differently.
00:03:07 Also, there are moments in life
00:03:10 when we are sad and disappointed.
00:03:13 And Jehovah is fully aware that some of us are not healthy.
00:03:18 Others might fight depression
00:03:21 and are therefore at times just not able to express joy in this way.
00:03:26 And yet he loves all of us
00:03:30 and appreciates us very much.
00:03:34 So, then, what is the joy that Jehovah expects from us?
00:03:39 What exactly is this joyful spirit, or attitude?
00:03:44 Here in Deuteronomy, the term “rejoicing” means
00:03:49 “the inner feeling and the outward manifestation of joy.”
00:03:54 And we also read about the “joy of heart.”
00:03:58 The heart stands for what we are on the inside.
00:04:02 This is the interior man and is displayed
00:04:05 in all his various activities, desires, affections, emotions,
00:04:10 passions, thoughts, and so on.
00:04:15 And so we see that joy comes from within us.
00:04:20 Yet, does the joy we are talking about
00:04:24 depend on circumstances?
00:04:28 Let’s illustrate: I think it’s safe to say that we all like sunshine.
00:04:33 However, how does the farmer feel
00:04:36 when he urgently needs it to rain
00:04:39 and he’s waiting and waiting?
00:04:43 He probably would be happier if he had rain.
00:04:47 In these last days, we rarely, if ever,
00:04:52 have perfect circumstances with no problems.
00:04:55 So I think we can all agree that our joy in Jehovah’s service
00:04:59 is not based on circumstances.
00:05:03 And we’ve had here on this program and in our publications
00:05:07 many examples of ones who have maintained their joy
00:05:11 in Jehovah’s service despite challenging circumstances,
00:05:14 like poor health or opposition.
00:05:19 So, then, what is it that makes us a happy person?
00:05:26 To help us to open up the scope of the answer,
00:05:29 would you be willing to join me for a little experiment?
00:05:32 Please close your eyes for a moment.
00:05:36 Do you have your eyes closed?
00:05:38 So now think about an apple.
00:05:43 Now you can open your eyes again.
00:05:46 Let me ask you a question:
00:05:49 Did you think about a red apple,
00:05:54 a green apple,
00:05:56 or a yellow apple?
00:05:59 Why are you able to answer this question?
00:06:01 All I asked you to do was to think about an apple.
00:06:06 The answer is, we think in pictures.
00:06:10 In fact, we think of countless pictures every day.
00:06:15 And after we think about it,
00:06:17 it’s like we put all of the pictures in a stack.
00:06:21 And then when we think the same thought a second time,
00:06:24 it’s like we pull the picture out from below
00:06:27 and put it on top of the stack.
00:06:30 The longer that we do not think the thought,
00:06:34 the deeper the picture gets in the stack
00:06:37 and it becomes more difficult to remember.
00:06:40 Now, this stack of pictures representing our thoughts
00:06:45 is our subconscious.
00:06:48 This stack of pictures makes up
00:06:51 our emotional state, or state of mind.
00:06:54 It determines whether we are sad or happy,
00:06:59 whether we are bored or excited, and so forth.
00:07:06 Jehovah our Creator is aware of this powerful connection
00:07:10 between our thoughts  and pictures.
00:07:14 Let’s please turn to 2 Kings chapter 6
00:07:18 to find one example of how Jehovah made use of this.
00:07:22 Here we find the report about the king of Syria
00:07:27 who wanted to capture Elisha.
00:07:30 How did his attendant feel?
00:07:33 Let’s see at 2 Kings chapter 6, beginning with verse 15:
00:07:40 “When the attendant of the man
00:07:42 “of the true God rose early and went outside,
00:07:46 “he saw that an army with horses and war chariots was surrounding the city.
00:07:51 “At once the attendant said to him:
00:07:53 “‘Alas, my master!
00:07:55 What are we to do?’”
00:07:57 The attendant was in fear.
00:08:00 He probably thought about their defenseless position
00:08:03 and saw himself already captured by the Syrian army.
00:08:07 Would Elisha be able to help his attendant?
00:08:11 Verse 16:
00:08:13 “But he [Elisha] said: ‘Do not be afraid!
00:08:18 For there are more who are with us than those who are with them.’”
00:08:23 In other words, Elisha said: ‘Think of something else.
00:08:27 Think of the many that are with us.’
00:08:30 Did this work?
00:08:32 It seems that the attendant was not able to focus on these reassuring thoughts.
00:08:37 He could not envision Jehovah rescuing them.
00:08:41 How did Jehovah help the attendant?
00:08:45 At 2 Kings 6:17, we read:
00:08:49 “Then Elisha began to pray and say:
00:08:54 “‘O Jehovah, open his eyes, please, that he may see.’
00:08:59 “Immediately Jehovah opened the attendant’s eyes and he saw,
00:09:04 “and look! the mountainous region
00:09:06 “was full of horses and war chariots of fire
00:09:09 all around Elisha.”
00:09:12 Jehovah helped the attendant with pictures.
00:09:16 The horses and chariots captured his attention.
00:09:19 His thoughts now focused on the fact
00:09:21 that Jehovah was with them and in full control.
00:09:26 Now, in his mind, he already saw Jehovah’s victory,
00:09:30 and he was not concerned anymore.
00:09:34 He was happy.
00:09:36 What he saw influenced his thoughts
00:09:40 and changed his state of mind.
00:09:42 Thoughts are so powerful!
00:09:46 And how considerate Jehovah is!
00:09:49 Remember, in the end, Jehovah did not need
00:09:51 any of these horses and chariots.
00:09:54 He saved Elisha and his attendant
00:09:56 by striking the Syrian army with blindness.
00:10:02 When we compare the emotions of Elisha
00:10:05 with his attendant, what made the difference?
00:10:08 The circumstances were exactly the same.
00:10:11 Their thoughts made the difference.
00:10:15 Now, what does this have to do with our subject
00:10:20 “Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing”?
00:10:23 So far, we have established that Jehovah expects us to be happy, right?
00:10:28 We have seen that our thoughts
00:10:30 can be pictures that influence
00:10:33 who we are and how we feel.
00:10:36 Pictures and thoughts are closely connected.
00:10:39 That’s why the apostle Paul at Romans 12:2
00:10:43 highlights the importance of our thoughts when he says:
00:10:46 “Be transformed by making your mind over,”
00:10:50 or at Ephesians 4:23, he emphasizes this by saying:
00:10:55 “And you should continue to be made new
00:10:57 in your dominant mental attitude.”
00:11:02 Both scriptures highlight that our thoughts
00:11:05 are critical and have a bearing on our whole being.
00:11:09 Additionally, the apostle Paul knew that we can change our thinking.
00:11:14 Please turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 10,
00:11:18 and see what he recommends that we do.
00:11:22 Here at 2 Corinthians 10:5, he says:
00:11:26 “We are bringing every thought into captivity
00:11:30 to make it obedient to the Christ.”
00:11:33 Isn’t this exactly what we should do?
00:11:36 We control what we think.
00:11:39 We avoid occupying our mind with thoughts that weaken our faith
00:11:43 or thoughts that undermine our determination to serve Jehovah.
00:11:48 Remember, we said that thoughts
00:11:51 are like pictures that stay within us.
00:11:54 We cannot delete them, and they will have an effect on how we feel.
00:12:01 But is there something else we can do?
00:12:04 Are you ready for a second experiment?
00:12:07 Please close your eyes again,
00:12:10 and do not think of an apple.
00:12:14 You can open your eyes again.
00:12:17 Were you successful in not thinking of an apple?
00:12:21 If so, you probably had to force yourself to think of something else.
00:12:26 We are made to think.
00:12:29 So the key to serving Jehovah with rejoicing
00:12:33 lies not just in avoiding negative thoughts
00:12:36 but also in thinking healthy thoughts.
00:12:40 Philippians chapter 4 lists a few of them.
00:12:44 We read in verse 8:
00:12:47 “Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,
00:12:51 “whatever things are of serious concern,
00:12:54 “whatever things are righteous,
00:12:56 “whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable,
00:13:01 “whatever things are well-spoken-of, whatever things are virtuous,
00:13:05 “and whatever things are praiseworthy,
00:13:08 “continue considering
00:13:10 [or “thinking about; meditating on”] these things.”
00:13:16 By considering and meditating on these healthy subjects,
00:13:20 we create pictures in our mind that make it easier for us
00:13:23 to display our joy in Jehovah’s service.
00:13:27 Serving Jehovah with rejoicing really depends on us.
00:13:32 Happiness does not depend on our circumstances;
00:13:35 happiness comes from doing things Jehovah’s way.
00:13:39 When we actively control our thoughts,
00:13:42 we add more pleasant pictures.
00:13:44 And even if in the past
00:13:47 we’ve experienced things that make it difficult
00:13:48 to express happiness,
00:13:50 in time,
00:13:53 these unpleasant pictures will be buried under thoughts
00:13:56 like those listed in Philippians chapter 4.
00:13:59 And gradually
00:14:00 our inner peace, contentment,
00:14:04 and happiness grows and can be seen by others.
00:14:08 Jehovah, our happy God,
00:14:10 appreciates every little step in this direction
00:14:13 because it’s important to him that we serve him with rejoicing.

00:00:01 This month, we’re going to discuss the theme
00:00:04 “Pray Continually,
00:00:06 So That You May Not Enter Into Temptation.”
00:00:09 Those words of Jesus
00:00:11 are recorded at Matthew 26:41.
00:00:15 In this discussion, we’ll answer three important questions:
00:00:21 (1) Why did Jesus pray?
00:00:25 (2) What temptations did he face?
00:00:28 and (3) What lessons can we learn from Jesus’ example?
00:00:33 Let’s start by reading that verse together.
00:00:36 That’s Matthew 26:41:
00:00:41 “Keep on the watch and pray continually,
00:00:44 “so that you may not enter into temptation.
00:00:47 “The spirit, of course, is eager [or, “willing,” ftn.],
00:00:51 but the flesh is weak.”
00:00:54 Why did Jesus pray?
00:00:57 Jesus uttered these words
00:00:59 on the final night before his execution.
00:01:02 No doubt this was the most difficult evening
00:01:05 that Jesus had ever faced.
00:01:08 The surrounding verses tell us
00:01:10 that “he began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled.”
00:01:15 It’s hard for us to comprehend fully
00:01:17 the stress and pressure Jesus was facing on that night.
00:01:22 He knew that Satan was about to throw everything he could at him.
00:01:27 Jesus also knew that he’d soon die
00:01:30 an agonizing death.
00:01:33 But something else was even harder for him to handle.
00:01:38 He realized that he was about to be falsely charged
00:01:42 and convicted of the despicable crime
00:01:45 of blasphemy against Jehovah’s holy name.
00:01:50 The study note on Matthew 26:39 says:
00:01:55 “Jesus no doubt felt great concern
00:01:59 “over the reproach that his death
00:02:01 “as one charged with blasphemy and sedition
00:02:04 “could bring on God,
00:02:06 “moving him to pray
00:02:08 that this ‘cup’ pass away from him.”
00:02:12 In the face of all that pressure,
00:02:15 would Jesus remain faithful until death?
00:02:19 The lives of countless people hung in the balance.
00:02:23 Even more important,
00:02:25 his Father’s reputation was involved.
00:02:29 Under all that intense emotional stress,
00:02:33 what did Jesus do?
00:02:35 He prayed, not just once,
00:02:38 but three times!
00:02:40 Notice how Luke describes what happened,
00:02:43 as recorded at Luke 22:44:
00:02:48 “But he was in such agony
00:02:50 “that he kept praying more earnestly;
00:02:53 “and his sweat became as drops of blood
00:02:57 falling to the ground.”
00:02:59 What’s the lesson for us?
00:03:01 Well, think about it.
00:03:04 Jesus knew Satan well.
00:03:06 Jesus had observed from heaven
00:03:08 all the temptations that Satan uses
00:03:11 in his efforts to ensnare God’s servants.
00:03:14 Yet, Jesus did not feel that he could easily handle
00:03:18 whatever “the Tempter” might place before him.
00:03:21 So this is a clear lesson for us:
00:03:24 If the perfect Son of God
00:03:26 felt the need to pray for divine help and strength,
00:03:30 how much more so should we.
00:03:33 How appropriate then is the admonition:
00:03:37 “Pray continually,
00:03:39 so that you may not enter into temptation.”
00:03:43 But what does it mean to “enter into temptation”?
00:03:48 The Watchtower  back in 1951 explained:
00:03:51 “We ourselves under Satan’s influence
00:03:55 “create the temptation by thinking how nice it would be
00:04:00 “to do or to have something contrary to God’s will,
00:04:03 “and then not dismissing the desire created by this improper thinking,
00:04:08 “but considering it more and more.
00:04:12 “In this way we are drawn out
00:04:14 “and led to ignore God’s counsel and warning.
00:04:18 We enter into temptation.”
00:04:23 Prayer helps us when we face temptation.
00:04:26 It helps us to focus on what Jehovah wants us to do
00:04:30 and to ask him for the strength not to enter into temptation.
00:04:35 Our second question:
00:04:36 What temptations did Jesus face
00:04:39 while here on earth?
00:04:42 We probably immediately think of the occasion shortly after Jesus’ baptism
00:04:47 when he was tempted three times by the Devil.
00:04:50 Let’s quickly summarize those three temptations.
00:04:54 First, Jesus was asked to turn stones into bread
00:04:59 at a time when he was extremely hungry.
00:05:02 Basically, Satan appealed to Jesus’ desire for food.
00:05:07 However, Jesus immediately rejected the temptation
00:05:10 to satisfy that desire in an inappropriate way.
00:05:16 Second, Satan challenged Jesus
00:05:18 to throw himself off the temple battlement.
00:05:21 Jesus rejected this temptation as well.
00:05:25 Why?
00:05:26 Because he knew that such a spectacular display
00:05:30 would amount to a prideful testing of Jehovah.
00:05:35 Finally,
00:05:36 Satan offered Jesus
00:05:38 “all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.”
00:05:42 But at what price?
00:05:45 Satan demanded that Jesus offer him in return
00:05:48 an act of worship.
00:05:50 What was Jesus’ answer?
00:05:52 He flatly refused, saying: “Go away, Satan!”
00:05:58 Have you had to face similar temptations?
00:06:01 Well, you might quickly answer:
00:06:03 ‘No one has asked me to turn stones into bread
00:06:06 ‘or to jump off a tall building.
00:06:08 ‘And certainly no one has offered me
00:06:10 the rulership of all the governments in the world!’
00:06:13 But notice, please, we said “similar,” not “the same.”
00:06:17 So have you faced similar temptations?
00:06:20 No doubt you have.
00:06:22 Most of us have faced temptations
00:06:25 involving fleshly desires.
00:06:27 It may have been temptations to commit immorality
00:06:32 or temptations that appealed to greed
00:06:34 or an unbalanced concern about material things.
00:06:38 Other temptations may have appealed to our pride or tested our humility
00:06:43 or our desire to impress others.
00:06:48 And who of us hasn’t been tempted by opportunities
00:06:51 offered to us by Satan’s world
00:06:53 for wealth, power, or position?
00:06:57 No matter what temptation comes our way, though,
00:07:00 remember Jesus’ words: “Pray continually,
00:07:04 so that you may not enter into temptation.”
00:07:09 But were those the only temptations that Jesus faced?
00:07:13 No.
00:07:14 How do we know?
00:07:15 Well, notice Luke’s words
00:07:17 found at Luke 4:13:
00:07:22 “So the Devil, having finished all the temptation,
00:07:27 departed from him until another convenient time.”
00:07:32 Did Satan ever come back again to tempt Jesus?
00:07:36 He must have because of what we’re told
00:07:39 at Hebrews 4:15.
00:07:43 Let’s read that:
00:07:45 “For we do not have a high priest
00:07:48 “who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
00:07:52 “but we have one who has been tested
00:07:54 “in all respects as we have,
00:07:57 but without sin.”
00:08:00 Have you ever wondered what other “convenient time”
00:08:03 Satan selected to test Jesus?
00:08:06 Well, let’s consider some possibilities.
00:08:09 One example occurred in 32 C.E.,
00:08:13 about two and a half years after the initial temptations.
00:08:18 Please turn to John 6:15:
00:08:23 “Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come
00:08:26 “and seize him to make him king,
00:08:28 withdrew again to the mountain all alone.”
00:08:33 This seems like a similar temptation
00:08:36 to what Jesus had already faced.
00:08:38 But this time, the setting was different.
00:08:41 Satan didn’t directly offer the kingship to Jesus.
00:08:45 There was no demand for Jesus to worship the Devil.
00:08:49 Rather, those following Jesus wanted to make him their king.
00:08:54 This temptation was going to be by popular demand.
00:08:59 How did Jesus react?
00:09:01 Well, even before they could make their move,
00:09:04 Jesus withdrew from them to a mountain, just by himself.
00:09:08 And what did he do on the mountain?
00:09:11 We find the answer in a detail
00:09:14 added in the parallel account recorded by Matthew.
00:09:19 Let’s read it together.
00:09:21 It’s Matthew 14:23:
00:09:25 “After sending the crowds away,
00:09:28 he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.”
00:09:33 Yes, Jesus went there not just to avoid the crowds
00:09:37 but to pray.
00:09:39 The third question:
00:09:42 What lessons can we learn
00:09:43 from Jesus’ example?
00:09:46 Even though we may have passed a test,
00:09:48 or avoided entering into temptation, in the past,
00:09:52 we shouldn’t be surprised
00:09:55 if a similar temptation may arise again
00:09:58 but in a different form or situation
00:10:01 and at a convenient time.
00:10:03 For whom?
00:10:05 For Satan, not us.
00:10:08 Another occasion occurred when Jesus and his apostles
00:10:11 were in the vicinity of Mount Hermon,
00:10:14 near Caesarea Philippi.
00:10:16 Jesus’ apostles had just acknowledged him
00:10:19 as “the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
00:10:23 So Jesus took the opportunity to expand their thinking further.
00:10:27 Notice what’s recorded
00:10:29 at Matthew 16:21:
00:10:34 “From that time forward,
00:10:36 “Jesus began explaining to his disciples
00:10:39 “that he must go to Jerusalem
00:10:41 “and suffer many things
00:10:43 “from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed,
00:10:48 and on the third day be raised up.”
00:10:52 What was the reaction of his apostles to this information?
00:10:56 Let’s read on in verse 22:
00:10:59 “At this Peter took him aside
00:11:02 “and began to rebuke him, saying:
00:11:04 “‘Be kind to yourself, Lord;
00:11:07 you will not have this happen to you at all.’”
00:11:10 Although these words were uttered by a close friend,
00:11:13 Jesus immediately recognized
00:11:16 that they reflected Satan’s wishes, not Jehovah’s.
00:11:20 So he firmly responded:
00:11:22 “Get behind me, Satan!
00:11:24 “You are a stumbling block to me,
00:11:27 “because you think, not God’s thoughts,
00:11:30 but those of men.”
00:11:33 Although this account doesn’t specifically refer
00:11:36 to Jesus praying at that time,
00:11:38 we know that Jesus was a man of prayer.
00:11:42 The apostle Paul tells us at Hebrews 5:7:
00:11:45 “During his life on earth,
00:11:48 “Christ offered up supplications and also petitions,
00:11:52 with strong outcries and tears.”
00:11:56 So no doubt those prayers helped Jesus
00:11:58 to focus on the reason why he came to earth.
00:12:02 That clear focus helped him to see
00:12:05 that Peter’s misguided counsel
00:12:07 would only help to further the Tempter’s cause.
00:12:11 What does this teach us?
00:12:14 This shows us that temptations don’t always come
00:12:18 from those who are Jehovah’s enemies.
00:12:21 Some who are close to us
00:12:23 may even serve Satan’s ends unintentionally,
00:12:27 as was the case with Peter.
00:12:29 It could be an employer, a workmate, a schoolmate,
00:12:33 a friend, a relative, a parent,
00:12:36 a brother, or a marriage mate.
00:12:40 Let’s examine another example of how Satan returned to Jesus.
00:12:45 This time, it was by means of the religious leaders.
00:12:49 They attacked Jesus verbally,
00:12:51 misquoting Scripture and hurling senseless accusations at him.
00:12:56 But Jesus understood what they were up to and frankly told them:
00:13:01 “You are from your father the Devil.”
00:13:04 We shouldn’t be surprised if apostates and other opposers
00:13:09 use similar tactics today.
00:13:11 Just as Jesus was accused of blasphemy
00:13:15 and political sedition,
00:13:17 so too God’s people have been labeled as “extremists”
00:13:21 and have been the victims of all sorts of false accusations.
00:13:26 Like Jesus, we remember
00:13:28 who really is behind all these attacks
00:13:31 —Satan, the great Tempter!
00:13:35 What will help us to avoid the temptation
00:13:38 of giving up because of discouragement?
00:13:41 How can we successfully handle
00:13:43 all these types of attacks?
00:13:46 Paul tells us what to do.
00:13:50 We read at Ephesians 6:11:
00:13:54 “Put on the complete suit of armor from God
00:13:58 “so that you may be able to stand firm
00:14:01 against the crafty acts of the Devil.”
00:14:04 After speaking about the importance of putting on the spiritual suit of armor,
00:14:09 Paul goes on to say in verse 18
00:14:13 that this should be done together “with every form of prayer
00:14:17 “and supplication
00:14:19 [as we] carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit.”
00:14:24 So, what have we learned from our discussion?
00:14:28 It seems that Satan didn’t try again to tempt Jesus directly,
00:14:33 but he was persistent.
00:14:35 He kept coming back in different guises.
00:14:38 He used others to give Jesus wrong advice,
00:14:41 to oppose and ridicule him,
00:14:43 as well as to try to make him a king.
00:14:47 Perhaps we’ve rejected some serious temptations in the past,
00:14:52 but remember, Satan doesn’t give up on us
00:14:55 just because he failed in the past.
00:14:58 At a time convenient to him,
00:15:01 he may come back to tempt us with something completely different
00:15:06 or the same temptation
00:15:08 dressed up in a different form.
00:15:11 So, what’s the key to not entering into temptation?
00:15:16 We need to remember and apply Jesus’ admonition:
00:15:21 “Pray continually,
00:15:23 so that you may not enter into temptation.”

00:00:00 Imagine the astonished look on the faces of the apostles.
00:00:05 The resurrected Jesus stands before them
00:00:07 on the Mount of Olives.
00:00:09 Just before he disappears into the clouds,
00:00:13 Jesus makes this profound declaration,
00:00:16 as recorded at Acts 1:8:
00:00:20 “You will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you,
00:00:24 “and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem,
00:00:27 “in all Judea and Samaria,
00:00:30 and to the most distant part of the earth.”
00:00:35 What an assignment!
00:00:37 They were to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom
00:00:40 throughout the earth.
00:00:42 Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed
00:00:45 and wondered how such a small band of preachers
00:00:48 could ever get this work done.
00:00:51 Ten days later, they received the promised holy spirit,
00:00:56 and they got to work.
00:00:58 True, they faced many challenges.
00:01:01 But that did not stop them.
00:01:04 Three years passed, and the preaching work
00:01:06 was expanded to include Gentiles.
00:01:10 We can read the moving account in Acts chapter 10.
00:01:14 First, an angel of God appears
00:01:17 to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.
00:01:21 Then, Peter responds to the leadings of God’s spirit
00:01:23 to go to the officer’s home.
00:01:26 There, Peter gives a thorough witness about Jesus
00:01:30 not only to Cornelius
00:01:32 but also to his family and friends.
00:01:35 As he concludes his discourse,
00:01:38 Peter explains the commission he received to be an evangelizer.
00:01:43 Let’s open to Acts 10:42,
00:01:46 and note the two main aspects
00:01:49 of the preaching work started by Jesus:
00:01:52 “Also, he ordered us to preach to the people
00:01:56 “and to give a thorough witness
00:01:59 “that this is the one decreed by God
00:02:01 to be judge of the living and the dead.”
00:02:05 First, Jesus commanded his disciples
00:02:08 “to preach to the people.”
00:02:10 In addition, they were “to give a thorough witness.”
00:02:14 The disciples were to search out honesthearted, deserving ones.
00:02:19 That would require a thorough coverage of their territory.
00:02:23 In spite of vicious persecution,
00:02:26 Christians in the first century obeyed Jesus’ command
00:02:29 to preach and to bear thorough witness.
00:02:33 And by about 60 of our Common Era,
00:02:35 less than 30 years after the Christians had received their commission,
00:02:40 Paul could write to the congregation in Colossae
00:02:43 that the good news had been “preached in all creation under heaven.”
00:02:49 What a testimony to the power of God’s holy spirit
00:02:54 and the faith, zeal,
00:02:56 and determination of those early disciples!
00:03:00 In the late 1800’s, a small group of Bible students
00:03:04 rose to the challenge of bearing thorough witness.
00:03:08 An article in the April 1881 issue of Zion’s Watch Tower
00:03:13 had the thrilling title
00:03:15 “Wanted 1,000 Preachers.”
00:03:20 Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are bearing witness
00:03:23 in 240 lands.
00:03:25 But doing so has its challenges.
00:03:28 What are some of those challenges, and what can we do to meet them?
00:03:33 Many of our brothers face the challenge of long distances,
00:03:37 climate extremes, rough terrain,
00:03:40 and poor travel conditions.
00:03:43 In some areas, just getting to meet people
00:03:46 is a challenge.
00:03:49 To add to the challenge, Revelation 14:6 reminds us
00:03:53 that the good news would be declared
00:03:55 “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.”
00:04:00 This can require learning a new language
00:04:03 and understanding different religious, ethnic,
00:04:06 and cultural backgrounds.
00:04:09 It can mean coping with unresponsive territories,
00:04:12 apathy, and poor living conditions.
00:04:16 Jesus warned that opposers would try
00:04:18 to hinder or stop the preaching work.
00:04:21 No doubt you are facing some form of challenge
00:04:25 in your local territory.
00:04:27 We cannot begin to give possible solutions
00:04:29 to all the obstacles we face today.
00:04:33 But it is helpful to learn how others are coping with their challenges,
00:04:38 and this can stimulate our thinking
00:04:40 to identify ways to meet our challenges.
00:04:45 Let’s focus on three Bible principles that will help us
00:04:49 to carry out our ministry successfully:
00:04:53 (1) Trust in Jehovah,
00:04:56 (2) be flexible,
00:04:59 and (3) stay focused.
00:05:04 How can trusting in Jehovah help us?
00:05:07 Consider an example.
00:05:09 During the 1990’s, Jehovah’s Witnesses in France
00:05:14 endured an avalanche of negative media reports.
00:05:17 As a result of these vicious attacks,
00:05:20 some brothers lost their jobs,
00:05:22 Witness children were taunted at school,
00:05:26 preaching became extremely difficult in some areas.
00:05:30 How did they cope?
00:05:32 The turning point came in January 1999.
00:05:36 The Governing Body approved a special campaign
00:05:39 to distribute a magazine-size tract
00:05:41 that exposed all of the accusations as false.
00:05:45 Beginning early one Friday morning, Witnesses throughout France
00:05:50 distributed 12 million copies of the tract
00:05:53 in just three days.
00:05:55 This campaign gave them renewed strength
00:05:58 and boldness to preach.
00:06:00 In the 19 years that followed,
00:06:03 there was a continuous increase in the number of publishers
00:06:06 and the ranks of regular pioneers
00:06:08 swelled to over 15,000.
00:06:13 If you constantly face a barrage of negative media reports,
00:06:17 does this mean that you need a special campaign to meet the challenge?
00:06:22 Not necessarily.
00:06:24 Although the campaign was a stimulus,
00:06:27 brothers and sisters in France said
00:06:29 that what really gave them strength and boldness
00:06:33 were the words of 2 Chronicles 32:8.
00:06:37 Let’s read it.
00:06:39 The setting is in the time of King Hezekiah of Judah.
00:06:43 The people were beaten down
00:06:45 by the repeated threats and taunts of the Assyrians.
00:06:50 What strengthened them?
00:06:52 Speaking about the king of Assyria, King Hezekiah declared:
00:06:57 “With him is an arm of flesh,
00:07:01 “but with us is Jehovah our God to help us
00:07:05 and to fight our battles.”
00:07:07 What was the result?
00:07:09 “The people were strengthened by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.”
00:07:15 Just hearing this reminder that Jehovah would help them
00:07:19 was enough to strengthen the Jews.
00:07:22 Jehovah took action and sent an angel
00:07:25 to destroy the enemy army.
00:07:28 Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?
00:07:32 Note what we read at Revelation 14:6:
00:07:37 “I saw another angel flying in midheaven,
00:07:40 “and he had everlasting good news to declare
00:07:43 “to those who dwell on the earth,
00:07:46 “to every nation and tribe
00:07:48 and tongue and people.”
00:07:51 Be sensitive to angelic direction
00:07:54 and the leadings of God’s holy spirit.
00:07:58 If you feel moved to make that one last call
00:08:01 or to speak to the person next to you on the bus, do it!
00:08:05 Speak up.
00:08:07 It may well be that an angel is directing you
00:08:10 to one who is “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
00:08:15 Now let’s consider the second Bible principle
00:08:18 that will help us to bear thorough witness:
00:08:21 Be flexible.
00:08:23 Sometimes just getting to talk to people can be a challenge.
00:08:27 To overcome this obstacle, we need to be flexible.
00:08:32 Takanori and Yumi Takahashi have served in territories
00:08:36 that are as different as night and day.
00:08:39 Recently, they visited our studio.
00:08:42 Listen as they tell us how they have learned
00:08:45 to meet the challenges of bearing thorough witness.
00:08:51 Takanori and Yumi,
00:08:52 welcome to our studio!
00:08:54 Thank you for inviting us.
00:08:56 And we’re very happy to have you here.
00:08:59 Takanori, you and I go back a long way.
00:09:02 I still remember when you came into Japan Bethel back in 1977,
00:09:07 and we served in the same congregation for a number of years.
00:09:11 But then in 1990, you had a big change in your life.
00:09:15 Would you like to tell us what happened?
00:09:17 Yes, my twin brother,
00:09:19 Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.
00:09:23 To our surprise, we were assigned
00:09:27 to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.
00:09:29 That was a big change!
00:09:31 And here you are working in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.
00:09:35 During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,
00:09:38 I understand that you served in the missionary field,
00:09:41 in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.
00:09:44 So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?
00:09:46 Takanori and I were married in September 1993,
00:09:51 and I joined him in the missionary work.
00:09:54 Adapting to remote territories such as this was a challenge.
00:09:59 So in order to bear thorough witness,
00:10:01 what kind of challenges did you have to overcome?
00:10:05 The people of Papua New Guinea are very friendly.
00:10:08 They have a deep respect for the Bible.
00:10:12 It was easy to relax,
00:10:14 speak to them face-to-face,
00:10:16 to read the Scriptures together, and reason with them.
00:10:21 Those don’t sound like challenges.
00:10:23 Did you face any obstacles?
00:10:25 When we preached in the villages,
00:10:28 the response of the local people
00:10:30 often depended on the response of the village chief.
00:10:35 If he listened, almost the whole village listened.
00:10:39 But if his response was negative,
00:10:42 the people would walk away and hide in the bush.
00:10:46 So we would always show respect
00:10:50 and approach the village chief first.
00:10:53 This often moved him to view our visit with favor.
00:10:58 The challenge in the cities was mainly security.
00:11:02 It wasn’t safe for us to go into some areas alone
00:11:06 or to visit homes regularly.
00:11:08 So we would ask our Bible students to come to the Kingdom Hall
00:11:13 for their study before the meeting.
00:11:16 That was a good way to encourage them to attend meetings.
00:11:21 Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed your service in Papua New Guinea.
00:11:25 But now you’re serving as special pioneers in the Maihama Congregation
00:11:28 just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.
00:11:33 So you went from a territory where people have deep respect for the Bible
00:11:37 to a land where less than 1 percent of the people claim to be Christian.
00:11:41 So, what other kind of differences did you find
00:11:45 between your territory in Japan now and your missionary territory?
00:11:49 Oh, it’s very different.
00:11:52 Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,
00:11:55 and 70 percent of the homes
00:11:57 are in high-security apartment buildings.
00:12:01 We have to stand in the lobby in front of the doorman,
00:12:05 push a button, and speak to a camera.
00:12:09 Coming from Papua New Guinea,
00:12:11 we found it challenging to work this territory.
00:12:15 We were used to friendly discussions face-to-face.
00:12:19 Now we see only the lens of a camera.
00:12:22 But we have learned to view the camera as our friend.
00:12:27 As your friend?
00:12:28 I think most of us find it challenging to speak to a camera.
00:12:32 So how do you overcome this challenge?
00:12:35 We know that as soon as we push the button,
00:12:38 our face shows up on a screen inside of the apartment.
00:12:42 We stand an arm’s length from the camera
00:12:46 so that our face is framed nicely.
00:12:49 And we adjust our volume accordingly,
00:12:52 taking into consideration the doorman and others who may be listening.
00:12:57 We say our greeting
00:12:59 about two seconds after we push the button,
00:13:03 just when we know that they are looking at the monitor.
00:13:07 Our friendly greeting and warm smile
00:13:10 makes them feel like we can actually see their face.
00:13:15 We prepare a specific appealing introduction
00:13:19 and show them respect and consideration.
00:13:24 The people in our territory like to be viewed as successful,
00:13:29 not as people who have problems.
00:13:31 So we try to focus on positive subjects.
00:13:35 We prepare a variety of subjects
00:13:38 so that they don’t hear the same message over and over.
00:13:43 Like many people, Japanese do not like to be put on the spot.
00:13:47 So instead of asking a question and waiting for them to answer,
00:13:52 we use the teaching method of our tracts
00:13:56 and give three possible answers for them to choose from.
00:13:59 Well, have you had positive results from this intercom preaching?
00:14:04 Since we started to use this method,
00:14:07 the number of not-at-homes has decreased.
00:14:11 And also, when we meet people on the street,
00:14:14 sometimes they say they know us
00:14:17 because they saw us on their intercom.
00:14:20 That was excellent!
00:14:22 And thank you, Takanori and Yumi, for sharing with us
00:14:26 how you have met the challenge of bearing thorough witness
00:14:29 in a variety of territories.
00:14:33 First Corinthians 9:22, 23
00:14:37 —let’s read it.
00:14:40 “I have become all things to people of all sorts,
00:14:44 “so that I might by all possible means save some.
00:14:48 “But I do all things for the sake of the good news,
00:14:52 in order to share it with others.”
00:14:55 “Become all things.”
00:14:57 “Do all things.”
00:14:59 In other words, be flexible.
00:15:02 Apply the suggestions in the meeting workbook.
00:15:06 Get well-acquainted with each tool in the Teaching Toolbox.
00:15:10 Observe how experienced publishers
00:15:12 and pioneers use those tools.
00:15:15 Understand the feelings and circumstances
00:15:18 of people in the territory.
00:15:20 Even in the same territory, we may need to use a variety of approaches.
00:15:25 For example, about 40 percent
00:15:28 of the apartment buildings in the Takahashi’s territory
00:15:31 do not allow the Witnesses to enter the lobby,
00:15:34 so they do public and informal witnessing to reach those people.
00:15:39 Now let’s consider the third Bible principle:
00:15:42 Stay focused.
00:15:44 At Matthew 6:22, Jesus said:
00:15:48 “The lamp of the body is the eye.
00:15:51 “If, then, your eye is focused,
00:15:54 your whole body will be bright.”
00:15:58 Keeping our eye focused means keeping our life simple
00:16:03 in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.
00:16:06 Distractions take our attention and energy away
00:16:10 from our responsibility to bear thorough witness.
00:16:13 Before we can teach those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life,”
00:16:17 we have to find them.
00:16:20 We leave no stone unturned as we search for them at their homes,
00:16:24 on the streets, in parks,
00:16:27 in stores, and at the workplace.
00:16:30 There’s no on/off switch for our preaching work.
00:16:34 Our “preaching switch” must be on
00:16:38 at all times.
00:16:41 Not only do we look for opportunities to preach
00:16:44 but we also make opportunities.
00:16:48 What if our efforts to find interested ones
00:16:51 are not fruitful?
00:16:53 Jesus did not say that every human
00:16:55 must become a disciple before the end comes.
00:16:58 Rather, he said that the end will come
00:17:02 after the good news has been preached in all the inhabited earth
00:17:06 and a witness has been given to all the nations.
00:17:10 The apostle Paul stayed focused on his ministry.
00:17:13 May we imitate his positive attitude
00:17:17 expressed at Acts 20:24:
00:17:22 “Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life
00:17:25 “of any importance to me,
00:17:27 “if only I may finish my course
00:17:30 “and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus,
00:17:34 “to bear thorough witness to the good news
00:17:37 of the undeserved kindness of God.”
00:17:42 The opportunity to bear thorough witness will soon be over.
00:17:46 May we use the remaining time effectively
00:17:50 to search for deserving ones
00:17:52 and to teach them the truth.
00:17:56 Imitate the faith of Hezekiah,
00:17:58 and trust in Jehovah;
00:18:01 learn from the apostle Paul,
00:18:03 and be flexible;
00:18:06 obey Jesus’ direction,
00:18:08 and stay focused.
00:18:11 Then you too can meet the challenge
00:18:14 of bearing “thorough witness.”

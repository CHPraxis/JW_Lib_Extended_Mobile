Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:07.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next music-video presentation
is about to begin.

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch it,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please reflect on how our faithfulness now

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will lead to even greater joy in the future.

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have a mobile phone
or other electronic device,

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please adjust it to a setting
that will not disturb others.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now enjoy the presentation!

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:54.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this session
of our “Always Rejoice”! Convention,

00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:56.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which corresponds
to the Sunday morning session

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:59.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your printed program.

00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:04.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme is taken
from Psalm 37:4, which tells us:

00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:07.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:11.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:17.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to stand
as we sing together song number 22,

00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:22.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!”

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song, you may pause the program

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your local opening prayer.

00:11:26.544 --> 00:11:29.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 22.

00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:13.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be seated.

00:14:14.212 --> 00:14:18.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to rejoice
even when dealing with severe trials?

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:21.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible assures us that it is!

00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:24.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This morning’s seven-part symposium

00:14:24.223 --> 00:14:27.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will explain how Jehovah helps us to do so.

00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:31.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will introduce the one to follow.

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:35.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, let’s give our attention
to Brother Kenneth Flodin,

00:14:35.484 --> 00:14:37.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he presents the first talk, entitled

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Tribulation.”

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:55.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that in each of the titles

00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:59.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our symposium talks,
it uses the word “despite”?

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:05.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English word “despite” can mean
without being blocked or thwarted.

00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:09.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our ability to rejoice
will not be blocked or thwarted.

00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:13.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can actually rejoice despite trials.

00:15:13.856 --> 00:15:18.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially,
that sounds contradictory, doesn’t it?

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I usually associate with rejoicing

00:15:21.363 --> 00:15:25.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the receiving of gifts, not trials.

00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:27.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, that is the very point.

00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:31.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can rejoice
despite trials because of gifts

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah provides for us.

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:37.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to review
three of those in our symposium:

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:40.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relationship with Jehovah,

00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:42.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our precious brotherhood,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the glorious hope we have for the future.

00:15:45.888 --> 00:15:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Romans chapter 5,

00:15:50.393 --> 00:15:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 3-5,

00:15:53.562 --> 00:15:57.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can identify
when this first gift

00:15:57.817 --> 00:16:02.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is introduced in the verses
—a relationship with Jehovah.

00:16:02.446 --> 00:16:06.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 5:3-5 says: “Not only that,

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:09.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but let us rejoice while in tribulations,

00:16:09.328 --> 00:16:12.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we know
that tribulation produces endurance;

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endurance, in turn, an approved condition.”

00:16:16.127 --> 00:16:18.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “an approved condition” with whom?

00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:20.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s with Jehovah.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The approved condition,
in turn, hope,

00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:26.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hope
does not lead to disappointment.”

00:16:26.012 --> 00:16:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why not?

00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:29.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of this relationship with Jehovah.

00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:32.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Because the love of God

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:35.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has been poured out into our hearts
through the holy spirit,

00:16:35.688 --> 00:16:38.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was given to us.”

00:16:38.232 --> 00:16:42.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we endure trials,
we can sense Jehovah’s approval,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helps us
to rejoice despite the hardship.

00:16:46.866 --> 00:16:50.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now find Romans 8:38, 39.

00:16:50.369 --> 00:16:54.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know, Paul experienced
one trial after the other,

00:16:54.165 --> 00:16:57.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet he was convinced that no trial

00:16:57.668 --> 00:17:02.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could distance him from Jehovah
(could separate him from God’s love),

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an abiding relationship.

00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 8:38, 39 says: “For I am convinced

00:17:09.973 --> 00:17:14.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that neither death nor life
nor angels nor governments

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:17.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor things now here nor things to come

00:17:17.647 --> 00:17:20.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor powers nor height nor depth

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:23.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then he says] nor any other creation

00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:26.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

00:17:26.447 --> 00:17:29.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:34.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our relationship with God
can help us in times of trial.

00:17:34.998 --> 00:17:37.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how about the second gift from Jehovah?

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:9
—1 Peter 5:9—

00:17:40.962 --> 00:17:43.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan tries to capitalize on our trials,

00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice the admonition here in verse 9.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:52.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But take your stand
against him, firm in the faith.”

00:17:52.432 --> 00:17:54.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what will help?

00:17:54.476 --> 00:17:58.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Knowing that the same
kind of sufferings [so trials]

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are being experienced
by the entire association

00:18:01.524 --> 00:18:03.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your brothers in the world.”

00:18:03.943 --> 00:18:06.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have felt that trust,

00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the support from our brotherhood,
particularly in these last six months or so.

00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:13.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve sensed it so clearly.

00:18:13.161 --> 00:18:15.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:12 is our third gift from Jehovah

00:18:15.914 --> 00:18:19.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a provision to help us to endure trials.

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:24.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:12 and it says it
so very crystal clear.

00:18:24.172 --> 00:18:27.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Rejoice in the hope.”

00:18:27.968 --> 00:18:31.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it adds: “Endure under tribulation.

00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persevere in prayer.”

00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:37.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our relationship with Jehovah,
the brotherhood,

00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:42.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our hope can help us
deal with these circumstances,

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:45.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it might vary
depending on circumstance.

00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:47.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as an example,
a brother in prison might have

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:51.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no access at all to the brotherhood.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what sustains him?

00:18:53.535 --> 00:18:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in that case, it would be
his relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:56.872 --> 00:19:01.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be remembering Brother Harold King
on JW Broadcasting®.

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For four and a half years,

00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:07.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was in solitary confinement
in a Chinese prison.

00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:10.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was he really all alone?

00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:12.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The authorities thought so,

00:19:12.763 --> 00:19:17.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he had the best cell mate
anyone would ever want.

00:19:17.726 --> 00:19:21.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in his video interview:

00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:24.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I had a lovely relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:24.358 --> 00:19:27.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I loved him very dearly.
He was real.

00:19:27.444 --> 00:19:29.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t fictitious.”

00:19:29.947 --> 00:19:33.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Brother King was able
to rejoice under that trial

00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:37.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had developed
that real relationship with his God.

00:19:37.788 --> 00:19:42.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example:
A depressed brother or a sister

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:46.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be struggling to maintain
his relationship with God.

00:19:46.588 --> 00:19:50.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s another gift
from Jehovah that can come into play.

00:19:50.342 --> 00:19:53.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may be supported by one
or more of the brotherhood.

00:19:53.637 --> 00:19:58.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like a person
who’s fighting to breathe properly.

00:19:58.225 --> 00:20:02.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s still alive,
but he’s struggling to hold on.

00:20:02.187 --> 00:20:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in comes
the support of a medical team,

00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:09.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he begins functioning normally again
and breathing properly.

00:20:09.737 --> 00:20:13.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brotherhood can come
to our aid and support

00:20:13.157 --> 00:20:17.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re suffering depression
or some other serious trial.

00:20:17.745 --> 00:20:22.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can our hope
help us to rejoice despite the trial?

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:27.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example:
Some of us have Christian parents

00:20:27.254 --> 00:20:32.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are now old and incapacitated
in some way, and that’s a trial for us.

00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:36.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be like a loved one
having a bad accident,

00:20:36.889 --> 00:20:39.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he’s laid up in a hospital bed.

00:20:39.892 --> 00:20:42.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can’t take care of himself.

00:20:42.186 --> 00:20:47.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then the doctor comes in and says,
“He’s going to have a full recovery.”

00:20:47.191 --> 00:20:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that gives us hope.

00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:54.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s similar with our elderly parents
because of our sure hope for the future.

00:20:54.198 --> 00:20:56.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like Jehovah saying,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They’re going to have a full recovery
from the ravages of old age.’

00:21:00.037 --> 00:21:03.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope helps us to rejoice.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever our situation or trial, we can
be sure that one or more of these provisions

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us
suffer through the hardship with joy.

00:21:12.425 --> 00:21:15.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to find now Romans chapter 8,

00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:23.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans chapter 8, and we’re going
to look at verses 35 and 37.

00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:26.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,
we’re going to be considering

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of the seven trials
mentioned in verse 35.

00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please identify them with me.

00:21:31.652 --> 00:21:35.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 8:35 says:

00:21:35.198 --> 00:21:38.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

00:21:38.492 --> 00:21:41.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will [1] tribulation or [2] distress

00:21:41.495 --> 00:21:44.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or [3] persecution
or [4] hunger or [5] nakedness

00:21:44.332 --> 00:21:46.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or [6] danger or [7] sword?”

00:21:46.334 --> 00:21:49.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the seven,
but now look at verse 37.

00:21:49.378 --> 00:21:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “On the contrary,
in all these things [all seven of them]

00:21:52.882 --> 00:21:57.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are coming off completely victorious
through the one who loved us.”

00:21:58.638 --> 00:22:00.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, each symposium talk

00:22:00.723 --> 00:22:04.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will include a video
of a brother or sister

00:22:04.227 --> 00:22:07.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who experienced a trial, a severe one.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will identify which of these gifts

00:22:11.234 --> 00:22:15.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped them to rejoice
despite the tribulation.

00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:18.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider that first one
that Paul addressed;

00:22:18.616 --> 00:22:20.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s called “tribulation.”

00:22:20.618 --> 00:22:25.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tribulation refers to suffering
caused by some trying situation,

00:22:25.373 --> 00:22:29.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly a debilitating illness.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me
to 2 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:22:35.758 --> 00:22:39.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians chapter 12, and we’re going
to look at verses 7 and 8.

00:22:39.596 --> 00:22:42.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tribulation was vexing to Paul,

00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:45.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much so that he
called it a thorn in his flesh.

00:22:45.685 --> 00:22:50.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 12:7, 8 says:
“To keep me from becoming overly exalted,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was given a thorn in the flesh,

00:22:52.984 --> 00:22:56.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an angel of Satan, to keep slapping me,

00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:58.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might not be overly exalted.

00:22:58.698 --> 00:23:01.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Three times I begged the Lord about this,

00:23:01.534 --> 00:23:04.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would depart from me.”

00:23:04.162 --> 00:23:09.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A thorn in the flesh”
—so this obviously was a physical malady,

00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:13.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said it kept “slapping [him],”
so it was continuing on.

00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:18.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just like the common cold or flu,
and we’re better in a week or so.

00:23:18.051 --> 00:23:19.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was continual.

00:23:19.803 --> 00:23:22.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a chronic trial for him to deal with,

00:23:22.847 --> 00:23:25.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and based on the Scriptures,
it’s thought that it may have been

00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a serious degeneration of his eyesight.

00:23:29.312 --> 00:23:32.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that would have been
very disconcerting to Paul.

00:23:32.774 --> 00:23:35.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he prayed three times
that it would be gone.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Take it away from me.’

00:23:37.654 --> 00:23:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, they did not have
eyeglasses with corrective lenses back then

00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:43.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no eye surgery was available.

00:23:43.577 --> 00:23:47.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a chronic tribulation.

00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:50.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:
By means of holy spirit,

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:55.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had on a number of occasions
cured people of their sickness.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he could have easily wondered:

00:23:57.507 --> 00:24:00.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where is this gift of the holy spirit
when I need it?

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need a cure.’

00:24:02.304 --> 00:24:06.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what helped Paul to rejoice
despite his tribulation?

00:24:06.308 --> 00:24:09.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his close,
abiding relationship with Jehovah.

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you still have 2 Corinthians
chapter 12 there,

00:24:11.897 --> 00:24:14.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together verse 9.

00:24:14.107 --> 00:24:17.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is where Jehovah tells Paul,

00:24:17.944 --> 00:24:21.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You will have no miraculous cure.’

00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 9: “But he said to me:

00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:27.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My undeserved kindness
is sufficient for you,

00:24:27.955 --> 00:24:31.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for my power is being made perfect
in weakness.’”

00:24:31.249 --> 00:24:33.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says, ‘No cure,

00:24:33.377 --> 00:24:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m going to give you the power
to continue on despite the tribulation.’

00:24:38.382 --> 00:24:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice the relationship
that Paul evidently has with Jehovah

00:24:42.803 --> 00:24:45.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last part of that verse.

00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:49.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Most gladly, then,
I will boast about my weaknesses,

00:24:49.977 --> 00:24:54.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order that the power of the Christ
may remain over me like a tent.”

00:24:54.982 --> 00:24:58.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He rejoiced in the strength from Jehovah.

00:24:58.444 --> 00:25:02.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 10;
he said: “So I take pleasure

00:25:02.614 --> 00:25:06.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and we can substitute
with the word “rejoice.” I rejoice]

00:25:06.618 --> 00:25:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in weaknesses,
in insults, in times of need,

00:25:10.539 --> 00:25:13.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in persecutions
and difficulties, for Christ.

00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:18.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For when I am weak,
then I am powerful.”

00:25:18.088 --> 00:25:20.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we want you to watch a video,

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:24.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is an example of tribulation.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped this brother and his wife

00:25:28.015 --> 00:25:32.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice under tribulation
in the form of a serious illness?

00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:46.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For  the last 45 years,
I’ve been in the pioneer work,

00:25:46.116 --> 00:25:51.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveling work,

00:25:51.163 --> 00:25:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Bethel here
for a number of years.

00:25:55.042 --> 00:25:58.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My health was very good

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never had any problems at all.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I had a headache.

00:26:05.428 --> 00:26:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was severe.

00:26:07.596 --> 00:26:11.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really couldn’t see clearly—anything.

00:26:12.768 --> 00:26:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to the Bethel doctor,
and he referred us to a specialist,

00:26:16.772 --> 00:26:19.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the specialist
gave us the diagnosis

00:26:19.525 --> 00:26:23.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a very aggressive brain tumor
called glioblastoma.

00:26:26.449 --> 00:26:29.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had surgery the next Thursday.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, after surgery, he had radiation

00:26:34.373 --> 00:26:37.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and chemotherapy at the same time.

00:26:38.502 --> 00:26:41.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A year later, he had to have another surgery.

00:26:41.923 --> 00:26:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now he is on his fourth type

00:26:46.135 --> 00:26:48.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of chemotherapy treatment.

00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:53.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first time that he got sick,
the hardest thing

00:26:53.351 --> 00:26:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to see my husband
become increasingly dependent

00:26:56.979 --> 00:27:01.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon me and upon other people.

00:27:01.192 --> 00:27:03.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want this

00:27:03.611 --> 00:27:06.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to define who we are.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers played a pivotal role

00:27:11.702 --> 00:27:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tried to help us.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother found out
that I had to go in for surgery.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me a scripture,

00:27:20.002 --> 00:27:23.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we prayed together.

00:27:23.464 --> 00:27:25.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll always remember that.

00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:27.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a beautiful example.

00:27:29.429 --> 00:27:33.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also get a lot
of encouragement from Sara,

00:27:33.182 --> 00:27:35.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gets us prepared for meetings.

00:27:38.688 --> 00:27:42.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we go out in service,
I’ve gotten the opportunity

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and help people

00:27:45.904 --> 00:27:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just talk to them
and encourage them.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my Bethel assignment

00:27:54.954 --> 00:27:59.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Service Department,
I have a brother or two

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will come over and review a case

00:28:02.712 --> 00:28:07.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re considering,
and I get a lot of joy in that way.

00:28:07.634 --> 00:28:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very thankful that I
can still do a little something

00:28:12.555 --> 00:28:14.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help.

00:28:15.392 --> 00:28:17.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me,

00:28:17.435 --> 00:28:21.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’s been humble
through this whole thing, it’s been easier.

00:28:24.025 --> 00:28:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My hope is strong, and I’m going to keep

00:28:27.696 --> 00:28:30.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on going this way
and serve Jehovah

00:28:30.073 --> 00:28:34.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on into the new world
or whatever comes.

00:28:36.371 --> 00:28:39.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Scott and Sara Shoffner

00:28:39.165 --> 00:28:41.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a good relationship with Jehovah,

00:28:41.543 --> 00:28:44.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sara supported Scott wonderfully.

00:28:44.838 --> 00:28:48.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice
the additional gift from Jehovah?

00:28:48.717 --> 00:28:53.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scott said that the brotherhood
played a pivotal role in helping them.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembered
a specific scripture and a prayer

00:28:55.682 --> 00:28:58.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was shared before his surgery,

00:28:58.393 --> 00:29:01.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and young brothers came in and helped him
with his assignment afterward.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his own words,
he said that that brought him “a lot of joy”

00:29:05.901 --> 00:29:08.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—joy despite tribulation.

00:29:08.487 --> 00:29:10.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how about you?

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which of the provisions
from Jehovah is buoying you up

00:29:14.409 --> 00:29:18.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you deal
with your particular trial or tribulation?

00:29:18.121 --> 00:29:20.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your relationship with Jehovah?

00:29:20.123 --> 00:29:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it the brotherhood, your hope,
or maybe some other gift from God?

00:29:25.128 --> 00:29:28.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re stressed, under tribulation,

00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:32.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember this: It’s as if Jehovah
is watching the monitor,

00:29:32.594 --> 00:29:36.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sees us in pain of heart.

00:29:36.431 --> 00:29:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he reassures us and says: ‘Be calm.

00:29:39.393 --> 00:29:41.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to be OK.’

00:29:41.436 --> 00:29:43.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no matter the pain,
no matter the tribulation,

00:29:43.897 --> 00:29:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we remember
those words at Romans

00:29:46.358 --> 00:29:50.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 8, verses 37 and 39:

00:29:50.862 --> 00:29:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In all these things we
are coming off completely victorious

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who loved us.”

00:29:57.244 --> 00:30:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 39, it’s saying that nothing,

00:30:00.372 --> 00:30:03.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing, no tribulation
“will be able to separate us

00:30:03.834 --> 00:30:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God’s love
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:30:09.214 --> 00:30:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rejoice despite tribulation.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now it’s my pleasure to introduce

00:30:16.013 --> 00:30:18.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Samuel Herd,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the talk on the symposium

00:30:21.226 --> 00:30:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Distress.”

00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:34.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been distressed?

00:30:34.698 --> 00:30:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you haven’t, you’re not human,

00:30:38.202 --> 00:30:41.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because all humans
suffer from some form of distress

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the short period of life
that we have this side of the new world.

00:30:46.835 --> 00:30:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is distress?

00:30:49.505 --> 00:30:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some say it’s extreme anxiety.

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:54.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others say it’s sorrow.

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:58.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there are a few who label it as pain.

00:30:58.264 --> 00:31:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is it that causes the distress?

00:31:01.767 --> 00:31:03.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a number of things.

00:31:03.811 --> 00:31:08.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one that somewhat heads the list:
death of a spouse.

00:31:09.733 --> 00:31:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second behind that
is injury or some type of illness.

00:31:14.738 --> 00:31:17.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there’s the loss of a job.

00:31:17.491 --> 00:31:21.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How am I going to care
for my family, my wife, and my children?”

00:31:21.662 --> 00:31:24.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then here’s a very important one:

00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:29.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not being able to share

00:31:29.045 --> 00:31:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kingdom preaching work to the full.

00:31:32.548 --> 00:31:36.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these are reasons
why we are distressed.

00:31:36.636 --> 00:31:39.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course,
these are not the only reasons.

00:31:39.096 --> 00:31:41.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many others.

00:31:41.098 --> 00:31:44.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how would you fare?

00:31:44.977 --> 00:31:47.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you feel

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:51.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you were undergoing
some type of distress?

00:31:51.192 --> 00:31:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, could you be sad?

00:31:53.694 --> 00:31:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that how you’re going to feel?

00:31:55.988 --> 00:31:58.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you depressed?

00:31:58.032 --> 00:32:01.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some say: “Well, yes.
That’s what hits me.”

00:32:01.035 --> 00:32:05.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others say: “Well, low in spirits
—I just, I don’t know;

00:32:05.832 --> 00:32:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m just down and out.

00:32:08.292 --> 00:32:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My get-up-and-go got up and left.”

00:32:13.047 --> 00:32:18.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others say, “Well, I just feel
like going off and hiding and crying.”

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that pretty well sums it up.

00:32:20.346 --> 00:32:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it possible

00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice when distressed?

00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know it is
because we have examples in the Bible.

00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:34.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is filled with examples.

00:32:34.027 --> 00:32:37.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just going to isolate one or two.

00:32:37.113 --> 00:32:39.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was one who

00:32:39.365 --> 00:32:43.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoiced behind being distressed.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to rejoice
despite the feelings that he had.

00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:50.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have your Bible handy,

00:32:50.209 --> 00:32:53.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open it, please, to 2 Corinthians,

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read along with me

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians 7:5.

00:33:00.094 --> 00:33:02.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice that it says:

00:33:02.138 --> 00:33:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, when we arrived in Macedonia,
our bodies got no relief,

00:33:06.643 --> 00:33:10.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we continued
to be afflicted in every way

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:13.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—[now, note the following]
there were fights

00:33:13.399 --> 00:33:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the outside, fears within”

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“fights on the outside, fears within.”

00:33:19.906 --> 00:33:22.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Paul was up against it,

00:33:22.409 --> 00:33:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew it;
but yet he was able to rejoice.

00:33:26.996 --> 00:33:29.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was he up against?

00:33:29.624 --> 00:33:33.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, earlier, Paul had hoped
to meet up with Titus in Troas.

00:33:33.795 --> 00:33:36.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he hadn’t heard from Titus,
and he didn’t get a message from him.

00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:38.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wondered about him.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wondered how he was feeling.

00:33:43.263 --> 00:33:48.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was something hard-hitting
against him at this time

00:33:48.018 --> 00:33:50.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that Corinthian congregation?

00:33:50.979 --> 00:33:53.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul wanted to know.

00:33:53.023 --> 00:33:56.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he worried about his friend,
and we would too

00:33:56.276 --> 00:34:00.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were waiting to hear from a friend
and we hadn’t received an answer.

00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:04.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likely worried so much

00:34:04.951 --> 00:34:08.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it caused him to feel

00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:11.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somewhat depressed.

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:15.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He thought,
‘Well, how long will I have to wait

00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:18.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on my friend Titus?’

00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:21.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he didn’t have to wait too long.

00:34:21.218 --> 00:34:23.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Titus finally joined him in Macedonia.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:25.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened?

00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:30.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul was comforted,
and upon hearing Titus’ favorable report

00:34:30.102 --> 00:34:33.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the brothers and sisters in Corinth,

00:34:33.397 --> 00:34:36.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul “rejoiced even more,”

00:34:36.817 --> 00:34:39.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says 2 Corinthians chapter 7,

00:34:39.194 --> 00:34:42.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’ll just glance down
at verses 6 and 7.

00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:46.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he was helped by his brother.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:50.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the brotherhood that we
have to reach out to too.

00:34:50.831 --> 00:34:55.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it will help us
—this beautiful brotherhood

00:34:55.002 --> 00:34:58.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has brought us into.

00:34:58.338 --> 00:35:02.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll find
that our brothers are there for us

00:35:02.134 --> 00:35:05.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of what we
may be fighting against.

00:35:05.262 --> 00:35:07.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can rejoice.

00:35:07.347 --> 00:35:11.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may experience distress
in the form of discouragement.

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And usually all of us have had that

00:35:15.189 --> 00:35:18.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come into our life from time to time.

00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:21.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many things that can
bring about discouragement.

00:35:21.153 --> 00:35:24.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s something else:
anguish over a lost loved one

00:35:24.406 --> 00:35:26.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe a marriage mate has died.

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:29.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been together for many years,

00:35:29.453 --> 00:35:32.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like Jehovah said in the garden of Eden:

00:35:32.748 --> 00:35:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The two shall become one.”

00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:38.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, that’s really what happened
to you and your wife,

00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:41.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who you lost,
or your husband, who you lost.

00:35:41.298 --> 00:35:45.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you are somewhat low in spirits.

00:35:45.094 --> 00:35:47.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are blue.

00:35:47.096 --> 00:35:50.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re a little downhearted, gloomy,

00:35:50.891 --> 00:35:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heavyhearted and, yes, sad.

00:35:55.104 --> 00:35:58.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, let’s recall

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:03.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have three provisions
that can strengthen our ability to rejoice

00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:06.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the trials that we’re undergoing.

00:36:06.365 --> 00:36:08.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they?

00:36:08.158 --> 00:36:12.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s the first one:
It’s our relationship with Jehovah.

00:36:12.997 --> 00:36:16.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David had a fine relationship with Jehovah.

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:20.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’ll turn to 1 Samuel chapter 30,

00:36:20.129 --> 00:36:23.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just follow along
as you hear me say a few things

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind these two, three, or four verses.

00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to start with verse 1.

00:36:28.971 --> 00:36:32.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 1 Samuel chapter 30.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When his own men wanted
to kill David because the Amalekites

00:36:37.855 --> 00:36:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
burned the city down and had taken
their wives

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and children captive
—even took two of David’s wives—

00:36:45.988 --> 00:36:49.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was very distressed,
as you’ll see in that account.

00:36:49.992 --> 00:36:53.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, notice near the end of it,
there in verse 6:

00:36:53.454 --> 00:36:55.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But David strengthened himself

00:36:55.957 --> 00:36:58.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah his God.”

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s where our strength comes from too.

00:37:01.087 --> 00:37:04.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s from turning to Jehovah our God,

00:37:04.715 --> 00:37:08.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s there for us,
and he’s going to comfort us.

00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:10.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the God of comfort,

00:37:10.888 --> 00:37:14.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as was acknowledged
in his written Word, the Bible.

00:37:14.267 --> 00:37:16.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first:
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:37:16.686 --> 00:37:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here comes the second:
It’s our brotherhood.

00:37:22.525 --> 00:37:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, how we are strengthened
by our brothers!

00:37:26.529 --> 00:37:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the 133rd Psalm,

00:37:29.866 --> 00:37:33.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says
at the very beginning: “Look!

00:37:33.035 --> 00:37:35.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How good and how pleasant it is

00:37:35.997 --> 00:37:38.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:37:38.833 --> 00:37:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we all know
that that is a true statement,

00:37:42.712 --> 00:37:47.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also know something else:
It’s a major scheme

00:37:47.634 --> 00:37:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Satan the Devil
to isolate us from our brothers

00:37:51.387 --> 00:37:55.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>if</i>  he can put us in jail.

00:37:55.808 --> 00:38:00.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if that happens and we are jailed,
we can still associate.

00:38:00.355 --> 00:38:04.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we do that if we’re jailed
and they’re way off somewhere

00:38:04.067 --> 00:38:06.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re behind bars?

00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:09.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it is: by memories.

00:38:09.364 --> 00:38:13.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, get out your scrapbook
and photo album

00:38:13.243 --> 00:38:16.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are locked in your brain

00:38:16.246 --> 00:38:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(not the literal
but that are locked in your brain)

00:38:19.916 --> 00:38:23.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feed on the “spiritual scraps.”

00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:25.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they?
The memories.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Memories are foods
that strengthen and cause rejoicing.

00:38:29.717 --> 00:38:34.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if any of you out there
are as old as I am,

00:38:34.639 --> 00:38:38.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you know that old folks
do this all the time.

00:38:38.727 --> 00:38:41.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just too tired to do anything else,

00:38:41.813 --> 00:38:44.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we just live on memories.

00:38:44.357 --> 00:38:46.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it brings joy to our heart.

00:38:46.359 --> 00:38:48.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s the second thing:
our brotherhood.

00:38:48.403 --> 00:38:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the third is our hope.

00:38:50.864 --> 00:38:53.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hope is to serve Jehovah
under righteous conditions

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout eternity.

00:38:56.036 --> 00:38:59.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eternity is forever.

00:38:59.331 --> 00:39:01.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It never ends.

00:39:01.374 --> 00:39:04.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes on and on and on.

00:39:04.961 --> 00:39:08.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, look at the sky above;

00:39:08.798 --> 00:39:12.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you cannot see
a beginning or an ending.

00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:15.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s eternity: always there.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to be able to rejoice
for an eternity living forever.

00:39:20.685 --> 00:39:25.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,
take note of which provisions

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:30.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped our brother and sister to rejoice
—and that, despite distress.

00:39:41.289 --> 00:39:44.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew when we first got married
that we would enjoy having a family.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we first found out 

00:39:47.462 --> 00:39:50.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we were pregnant,
we were overjoyed.

00:39:50.716 --> 00:39:53.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Becky first told me she was pregnant,

00:39:53.218 --> 00:39:56.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like a light switch
went off in my heart.

00:39:56.513 --> 00:39:59.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, I felt like a dad.

00:40:00.267 --> 00:40:03.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instantly, you begin to make plans.

00:40:04.396 --> 00:40:06.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like all this love

00:40:06.398 --> 00:40:08.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just flooded in.

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:13.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Becky was feeling a little off,

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a friend encouraged us,
“Just go see the doctor.”

00:40:15.324 --> 00:40:16.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we did.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while we were there,
they did an ultrasound.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctor came back

00:40:22.414 --> 00:40:25.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said
there wasn’t a heartbeat anymore.

00:40:28.587 --> 00:40:32.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very difficult moment

00:40:33.175 --> 00:40:36.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something I can never forget.

00:40:36.553 --> 00:40:41.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because all of a sudden, all of those hopes,

00:40:41.558 --> 00:40:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those dreams,
those preparations you are making

00:40:45.896 --> 00:40:47.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they’re gone.

00:40:51.068 --> 00:40:56.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This place in your heart
that opened up to make room for this child

00:40:57.074 --> 00:41:01.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now this huge, gaping, open hole

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:04.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s nothing to fill it.

00:41:07.042 --> 00:41:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just is incredible emptiness.

00:41:10.713 --> 00:41:13.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know what to do.

00:41:13.883 --> 00:41:17.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was a meeting night,

00:41:17.636 --> 00:41:19.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we wanted to go to the meeting.

00:41:19.638 --> 00:41:23.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like the place
where Jehovah’s holy spirit is,

00:41:23.392 --> 00:41:26.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wanted to be there
because we knew

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were not going to be able
to survive this on our own strength.

00:41:30.524 --> 00:41:32.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed Jehovah.

00:41:33.611 --> 00:41:36.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After people learned
that we had lost

00:41:36.697 --> 00:41:38.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the baby, so many people

00:41:38.783 --> 00:41:41.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared a little bit
of their experiences with me,

00:41:41.452 --> 00:41:45.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made us feel not alone,
for sure.

00:41:45.581 --> 00:41:49.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has also given us
some incredible friends

00:41:49.502 --> 00:41:52.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—friends who have stuck closer to us

00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:54.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a brother,
friends who always seem to know

00:41:54.256 --> 00:41:56.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re having a hard day,
who have prayed with us,

00:41:56.717 --> 00:42:01.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have taken walks with us, listened.

00:42:01.222 --> 00:42:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know those are expressions
Jehovah has given us.

00:42:06.352 --> 00:42:10.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regaining joy
is a work in progress.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:14.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a particular scripture
in my personal study

00:42:14.402 --> 00:42:19.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I found very helpful,
Psalm 139, where it talks

00:42:19.407 --> 00:42:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how there’s nowhere

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can’t find us.

00:42:24.954 --> 00:42:27.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no darkness
that is too dark for Jehovah.

00:42:27.206 --> 00:42:30.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt
like such a dark place.

00:42:30.293 --> 00:42:34.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dwelling on that scripture
was something that helped me a lot.

00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:35.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gradually, bit by bit,

00:42:35.757 --> 00:42:38.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like Jehovah did help me

00:42:38.509 --> 00:42:42.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see beautiful things again.

00:42:45.892 --> 00:42:50.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we experience distress,
Jehovah helps us.

00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:53.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not left in despair.

00:42:53.775 --> 00:42:58.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, here
in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, it tells us,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we also include the footnote— 
Now, that’s the 8th verse

00:43:03.534 --> 00:43:05.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:43:05.745 --> 00:43:07.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is how it reads:

00:43:07.747 --> 00:43:11.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are hard-pressed in every way,
but not cramped beyond movement; 

00:43:11.376 --> 00:43:16.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are perplexed,
but not absolutely with no way out.”

00:43:16.381 --> 00:43:18.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the footnote says,

00:43:18.675 --> 00:43:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not left in despair.”

00:43:22.345 --> 00:43:26.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is not going
to leave us in despair.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, which provisions
from Jehovah are helping you to rejoice

00:43:29.727 --> 00:43:33.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any mental or emotional distress

00:43:33.064 --> 00:43:36.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you may be experiencing even now?

00:43:36.693 --> 00:43:41.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your relationship with Jehovah,
the brotherhood,

00:43:41.448 --> 00:43:45.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hope, or is it something else?

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to the provisions from Jehovah,

00:43:49.789 --> 00:43:53.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider these practical suggestions:

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maintain a healthy diet.

00:43:57.464 --> 00:44:01.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coupled with that, get sufficient rest,

00:44:01.968 --> 00:44:05.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get a measure of exercise.

00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:08.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can make two lists.

00:44:08.767 --> 00:44:12.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, of the problems that you can solve,

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other, of problems
you cannot solve at present.

00:44:17.525 --> 00:44:19.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Act on the first list,

00:44:19.778 --> 00:44:23.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leave the rest in Jehovah’s hands.

00:44:25.325 --> 00:44:28.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk things out with an elder

00:44:28.912 --> 00:44:33.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps a mature friend,
someone you’re close to,

00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:36.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a parent.

00:44:36.336 --> 00:44:39.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are there to help us,

00:44:39.881 --> 00:44:42.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re ready and willing

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the knowledge
and the understanding that they have.

00:44:46.138 --> 00:44:49.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll do it generously with you.

00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:52.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Realize that some forms of mental distress

00:44:52.978 --> 00:44:55.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may require professional assistance.

00:44:55.939 --> 00:45:00.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jesus said at Luke 5:31:

00:45:00.694 --> 00:45:04.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who are healthy
do not need a physician,

00:45:04.448 --> 00:45:07.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those who are ill do.”

00:45:07.409 --> 00:45:10.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, that decision is up to you,

00:45:10.203 --> 00:45:12.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s there in the scripture.

00:45:12.414 --> 00:45:16.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that you need
the help of a physician,

00:45:16.084 --> 00:45:20.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone who is qualified
to look into certain matters.

00:45:20.172 --> 00:45:24.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please rejoice in knowing
that you have Jehovah’s approval.

00:45:24.927 --> 00:45:28.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t doubt it, not even for a moment.

00:45:28.847 --> 00:45:32.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, granted, it’s not easy

00:45:32.184 --> 00:45:36.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with mental or emotional distress.

00:45:36.605 --> 00:45:38.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keep in mind

00:45:38.607 --> 00:45:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah understands,

00:45:41.985 --> 00:45:46.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will help you
to keep on enduring.

00:45:46.907 --> 00:45:51.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your loyal endurance
brings Jehovah’s approval,

00:45:51.245 --> 00:45:56.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is one of the greatest reasons
that we have for rejoicing.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know that God has not left you.

00:45:59.628 --> 00:46:03.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have his approval,

00:46:03.215 --> 00:46:08.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a large shield surrounding you,
and his blessing.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So rejoice in that knowledge,
and keep on rejoicing

00:46:12.474 --> 00:46:15.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite distress.

00:46:18.063 --> 00:46:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:46:24.945 --> 00:46:29.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice
Despite . . . Persecution.”

00:46:36.373 --> 00:46:41.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the beginning of Christianity,
Christians have been persecuted.

00:46:41.212 --> 00:46:46.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate with me
2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:46:47.259 --> 00:46:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul experienced persecution

00:46:50.513 --> 00:46:53.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and referred to it at 2 Corinthians

00:46:53.891 --> 00:46:58.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 11, verses 23-25,

00:46:58.729 --> 00:47:02.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it says: “Are they ministers of Christ?

00:47:02.692 --> 00:47:06.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reply like a madman,
I am more outstandingly one:

00:47:06.904 --> 00:47:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have done more work,
been imprisoned more often,

00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:13.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“suffered countless beatings,

00:47:13.035 --> 00:47:15.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and experienced many near-deaths.

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:20.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,

00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:24.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“three times I was beaten with rods,
once I was stoned,

00:47:24.714 --> 00:47:27.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“three times I experienced shipwreck,

Shortly after recounting
his many difficulties,

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:38.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 12, verse 10,

00:47:38.895 --> 00:47:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote:

00:47:41.397 --> 00:47:45.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So I take pleasure in weaknesses,

For when I am weak, then I am powerful.”

00:47:56.204 --> 00:48:00.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Paul took no pleasure
in persecution itself,

00:48:00.875 --> 00:48:04.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he rejoiced
because of what can result from it,

00:48:04.837 --> 00:48:07.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contributing to Jehovah’s vindication.

00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:13.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Philippians 1:14

00:48:13.972 --> 00:48:17.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then verse 18.

00:48:17.308 --> 00:48:21.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persecution gives us also an opportunity

00:48:21.396 --> 00:48:24.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see Jehovah act in behalf of his people

00:48:24.482 --> 00:48:26.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and magnify his name.

00:48:26.818 --> 00:48:29.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can lead to a fine witness.

00:48:29.821 --> 00:48:33.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Philippians 1:14, 18,

00:48:33.658 --> 00:48:35.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote:

00:48:38.705 --> 00:48:41.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now most of the brothers in the Lord

00:48:52.218 --> 00:48:55.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 18: “With what result?

In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing.”

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of weakening our relationship
with Jehovah and our hope,

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:16.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution can strengthen it.

00:49:18.078 --> 00:49:23.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the discussion recorded at Romans 5:3, 4,

00:49:23.083 --> 00:49:25.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul explains:

00:49:25.085 --> 00:49:28.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us [exult] while in tribulations . . . ;

00:49:28.463 --> 00:49:32.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“endurance, [leads to],
an approved condition;

00:49:32.509 --> 00:49:36.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the approved condition, in turn, [to] hope,

00:49:36.346 --> 00:49:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hope
does not lead to disappointment.”

00:49:40.725 --> 00:49:43.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no doubt that hope helps us <i>mightily</i>

00:49:43.937 --> 00:49:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure persecution.

00:49:47.732 --> 00:49:51.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible uses the word “hope”
in different contexts.

00:49:51.611 --> 00:49:54.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of the “hope of salvation,”

00:49:54.698 --> 00:49:58.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can refer to spiritual salvation.

00:49:58.577 --> 00:50:02.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is hope of surviving Armageddon.

00:50:02.164 --> 00:50:07.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s hope of everlasting life
on the Paradise earth.

00:50:07.169 --> 00:50:10.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s hope of immortality in heaven.

00:50:11.882 --> 00:50:16.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope was he talking
about at Romans 5:3, 4?

00:50:16.887 --> 00:50:20.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About the heavenly hope.

00:50:20.098 --> 00:50:22.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the context;

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 5:2

00:50:24.728 --> 00:50:27.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the second part of the verse says:

00:50:27.731 --> 00:50:32.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us rejoice,
based on hope of the glory of God.”

00:50:34.363 --> 00:50:38.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All Christians in the first century
had the heavenly hope.

00:50:38.867 --> 00:50:43.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their hope was not just that problems
or world conditions would be resolved

00:50:43.622 --> 00:50:46.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they would get healed
from some sickness.

00:50:46.917 --> 00:50:49.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their hope was the heavenly hope.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 1:3 says:

00:50:52.381 --> 00:50:55.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We always thank God . . .
when we pray for you . . .  

00:50:55.634 --> 00:50:59.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the hope that is being reserved

00:50:59.263 --> 00:51:01.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you in the heavens.”

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:05.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now please turn to Romans

00:51:05.144 --> 00:51:09.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 8, verses 20 and 21.

00:51:10.482 --> 00:51:15.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “great crowd” of Jehovah’s Witnesses
today hope that Jehovah

00:51:15.487 --> 00:51:20.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will reward them in an earthly paradise.

00:51:20.117 --> 00:51:23.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul pointed to that hope when he wrote

00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:28.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 8:20, 21:

00:51:30.252 --> 00:51:34.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the creation was subjected to futility,

00:51:34.423 --> 00:51:38.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not by its own will,
but through the one who subjected it,

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the basis of hope

00:51:40.513 --> 00:51:45.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the creation itself
will also be set free

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:48.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from enslavement to corruption

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:52.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the glorious freedom
of the children of God.”

00:51:53.901 --> 00:51:55.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when Paul said

00:51:55.945 --> 00:51:59.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:12

00:51:59.365 --> 00:52:01.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “rejoice in the hope” ahead,

00:52:01.992 --> 00:52:04.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he meant the heavenly hope.

00:52:04.704 --> 00:52:07.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the “other sheep”

00:52:07.081 --> 00:52:10.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can also rejoice in the hope
that’s ahead of them.

00:52:10.501 --> 00:52:14.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, we can all rejoice triumphantly.

00:52:14.922 --> 00:52:19.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope is dark;
your hope is bright.

00:52:19.051 --> 00:52:24.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope is collapsing;
your hope nears fulfillment.

00:52:24.056 --> 00:52:27.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope is based on credulity;

00:52:27.852 --> 00:52:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your hope is based on faith.

00:52:30.646 --> 00:52:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope leads to disappointment;

00:52:33.649 --> 00:52:36.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your hope leads to success.

00:52:36.694 --> 00:52:39.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For with the new world so very near,

00:52:39.947 --> 00:52:42.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fondest hopes,
whether heavenly or earthly,

00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:46.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be realized
to our eternal satisfaction.

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Titus 2:13:

00:53:01.135 --> 00:53:04.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“While we wait for the happy hope

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:08.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and glorious manifestation of the great God

00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:10.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of our Savior, Jesus Christ.”

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore, according to Romans 8:24, 25,

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hope will help us to endure.

00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:24.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hope that is seen is not hope, . . .

00:53:24.826 --> 00:53:28.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but if we hope for what we do not see,

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:32.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we keep [on] waiting for it with endurance,”
the scripture says.

00:53:34.127 --> 00:53:36.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are degrees of hope.

00:53:36.754 --> 00:53:41.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen or deepen our hope?

00:53:41.009 --> 00:53:43.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As to the term “hope”:

00:53:43.094 --> 00:53:47.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the Bible,
the basic sense of the Greek term <i>el·pis</i><i>ʹ</i><i>,</i>

00:53:47.348 --> 00:53:52.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“used here, [means] ‘expectation of good.’

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:56.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In this context,
Paul mentions hope last in a series

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—after tribulation, endurance,

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an approved condition.

00:54:02.363 --> 00:54:06.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he is obviously
not referring to the initial hope

00:54:06.159 --> 00:54:09.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gained by accepting the good news from God.

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:13.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, he is referring to a reinforced hope

“that a Christian can gain after enduring.

00:54:17.462 --> 00:54:20.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When a Christian faithfully endures trials,

00:54:20.715 --> 00:54:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he realizes that he has God’s approval.

00:54:24.052 --> 00:54:28.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This realization
strengthens his initial hope.”

00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:35.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul,
we can rejoice despite persecution.

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:41.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may encounter
hateful words and actions at school,

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at work, in our family,

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:48.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:57.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Sermon on the Mount,

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:59.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:04.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people reproach you

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:09.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and persecute you
and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

“against you for my sake.

“Rejoice and be overjoyed,

00:55:14.436 --> 00:55:17.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since your reward is great in the heavens,

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:21.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for in that way
they persecuted the prophets prior to you.”

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:28.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which provisions

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:32.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped our brother and sister to rejoice

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite persecution.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early one morning,
armed Russian special forces

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broke into my home.

00:55:52.933 --> 00:55:56.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They handcuffed me
and searched my place.

00:55:57.896 --> 00:56:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took me
to the FSB office for interrogation.

00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:04.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two days later, the court sentenced
me to pretrial detention.

00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:12.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared because I didn’t know

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:14.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how I would be treated in prison.

00:56:14.997 --> 00:56:17.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Threatening that things would
get worse for me, the officer demanded

00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:22.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I incriminate myself, admit guilt,
and give the names of my fellow believers.

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:25.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also really missed my dear wife.

00:56:25.591 --> 00:56:27.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so hard without her.

00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:30.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For two months, I didn’t have

any spiritual food or a Bible,

00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:35.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided to make one.

00:56:35.643 --> 00:56:37.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife sent me a notebook,

00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every day I wrote down verses

00:56:40.356 --> 00:56:42.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was able to remember.

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I had written about 500 verses,

00:56:45.444 --> 00:56:46.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was given a Bible.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was

00:56:48.531 --> 00:56:52.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so spiritually hungry,
I read it through in four months.

00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:54.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this time,
I wrote letters

00:56:54.286 --> 00:56:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my wife and friends
and shared interesting things

00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:58.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I learned from my reading.

00:56:58.499 --> 00:57:00.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the letters I received

00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:04.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from my friends and my dear wife
gave me the feeling

00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:07.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the brothers and sisters
were so close to me,

00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:10.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if they were in the cells next to me.

00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:11.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t lonely.

00:57:11.804 --> 00:57:14.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if my friends
were right there with me.

00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:20.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pretrial detention
isolates a person from society.

00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:23.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s impossible to isolate
someone from Jehovah.

00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:27.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the day,
I prayed to Jehovah many times,

00:57:27.153 --> 00:57:29.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I especially waited for bedtime.

00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When everyone was in bed
and only the night-light was on,

00:57:32.742 --> 00:57:36.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could talk to Jehovah as much as I wanted.

00:57:37.038 --> 00:57:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times when I was all alone

00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:44.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the cell and, of course,
I took advantage of the situation.

00:57:44.086 --> 00:57:48.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would get down on my knees
and would literally cry

00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:51.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as I prayed to Jehovah.

00:57:51.177 --> 00:57:54.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to write my requests to God

00:57:54.639 --> 00:57:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a sheet of paper and then mark off
the ones that he answered.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced that Jehovah
was very close to me.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:05.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also quietly sang our songs

00:58:05.024 --> 00:58:06.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the day.

00:58:06.484 --> 00:58:10.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I was all alone,
I sang at the top of my voice.

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:13.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also tried to give
a witness whenever possible.

00:58:13.366 --> 00:58:15.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discussed a variety of topics

00:58:15.827 --> 00:58:18.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything from tattoos
to “the king of the north.”

00:58:20.456 --> 00:58:23.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All my fears
and anxieties were for nothing.

00:58:23.751 --> 00:58:27.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in detention 343 days,

00:58:27.839 --> 00:58:29.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “not even a hair” fell from my head.

00:58:30.967 --> 00:58:34.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the most interesting
year of my life

00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:38.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an excellent school to help
refine my spiritual qualities.

00:58:38.224 --> 00:58:41.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never felt so close to Jehovah.

00:58:41.102 --> 00:58:45.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a great honor
to uphold God’s sovereignty in this way!

00:58:51.613 --> 00:58:54.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is helping you today to rejoice

00:58:54.282 --> 00:58:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any opposition
you may be experiencing now?

00:58:58.495 --> 00:59:01.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is your relationship with Jehovah,

00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:05.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brotherhood,
and your heavenly or earthly hope

00:59:05.502 --> 00:59:07.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all these things.

00:59:09.631 --> 00:59:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we rejoice
in the love of Jehovah and our brothers.

00:59:15.553 --> 00:59:17.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are enduring persecution,

00:59:17.972 --> 00:59:20.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be assured that your brothers

00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only your friends,
not only brothers in your congregation,

00:59:23.687 --> 00:59:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all around the earth
—are praying in your behalf.

00:59:27.816 --> 00:59:29.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angels observe you

00:59:29.943 --> 00:59:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel proud if you stay faithful.

00:59:33.822 --> 00:59:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can greatly contribute
to the encouragement of the faithful angels.

00:59:40.203 --> 00:59:43.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels,

00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your brothers can “take pride in you”

00:59:47.043 --> 00:59:51.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rejoice
“because of your endurance and faith”

00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:53.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite persecution.

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Turner,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:59:59.723 --> 01:00:03.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Hunger.”

01:00:12.986 --> 01:00:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel when you miss a meal

01:00:15.572 --> 01:00:18.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or haven’t eaten for some time?

01:00:18.033 --> 01:00:21.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, for many it affects their mood,

01:00:21.161 --> 01:00:23.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their ability to concentrate,

01:00:23.705 --> 01:00:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes their ability
to even think straight.

01:00:27.959 --> 01:00:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if that hunger
was beyond our control

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:37.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or prolonged to the point where we
had no other choice but to be hungry.

01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:41.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was the situation
that the apostle Paul found himself in

01:00:41.265 --> 01:00:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he engaged in his ministry.

01:00:44.226 --> 01:00:47.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
at 2 Corinthians 11:27, Paul said

01:00:47.688 --> 01:00:52.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was “in hunger and thirst,
[and] frequently without food.”

01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:55.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This likely occurred while Paul was traveling

01:00:55.487 --> 01:00:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through desolate regions or hot desert areas.

01:00:59.533 --> 01:01:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, he may have been hungry and thirsty

01:01:01.577 --> 01:01:03.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of being dependent on strangers

01:01:03.912 --> 01:01:07.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on whatever provisions
he could obtain through his own labors

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in unfamiliar surroundings.

01:01:10.169 --> 01:01:13.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul also lived
during the time of a great famine

01:01:13.881 --> 01:01:16.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a famine which lasted
more than three years

01:01:16.383 --> 01:01:21.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caused oppressive poverty
in Judea and Jerusalem.

01:01:21.388 --> 01:01:26.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite facing
all these times without food,

01:01:26.143 --> 01:01:30.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s interesting to note
the attitude of the apostle Paul.

01:01:30.648 --> 01:01:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 6:10,

01:01:33.609 --> 01:01:36.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he describes himself
and his fellow Christians

01:01:36.236 --> 01:01:39.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as sorrowing

01:01:39.073 --> 01:01:42.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but ever rejoicing.”

01:01:42.368 --> 01:01:45.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul acknowledged that difficult times

01:01:45.663 --> 01:01:49.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could bring a measure of sorrow and distress.

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how was he able to rejoice

01:01:53.879 --> 01:01:58.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have this inner joy—
despite his hunger?

01:01:58.884 --> 01:02:00.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice his answer.

01:02:00.886 --> 01:02:04.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me in your Bibles,
please, to the book of Philippians.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to read
Philippians chapter 4,

01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 11-13.

01:02:13.732 --> 01:02:18.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “Not that I am saying this
because I am in need,

01:02:18.404 --> 01:02:22.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for I have learned to be self-sufficient
regardless of my circumstances.

01:02:22.742 --> 01:02:27.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know how to be low on provisions
and how to have an abundance.

01:02:27.747 --> 01:02:31.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In everything and in all circumstances

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:36.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have learned the secret
of both how to be full and how to hunger,

01:02:36.213 --> 01:02:40.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“both how to have an abundance
and how to do without.

01:02:40.426 --> 01:02:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:46.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

01:02:47.516 --> 01:02:49.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note that in verse 12,

01:02:49.852 --> 01:02:52.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul speaks of learning “the secret

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both how to be full and how to hunger”?

01:02:57.068 --> 01:03:01.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This secret involves relying on Jehovah

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:06.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for life’s necessities and being satisfied
with whatever he provides.

01:03:07.203 --> 01:03:09.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul certainly did that.

01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:13.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He learned a trade to support himself
so as not to be a burden to others.

01:03:13.835 --> 01:03:16.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was fully occupied with his ministry,

01:03:16.629 --> 01:03:19.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he had few material possessions.

01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:22.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was grateful for the brotherhood.

01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was appreciative of what those brothers
were able to provide—what he needed.

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:31.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul learned
through each of these experiences.

01:03:31.602 --> 01:03:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as he saw Jehovah’s hand in his life,

01:03:34.897 --> 01:03:39.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became apparent to him
that no matter what the circumstances were,

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had to look to Jehovah
to satisfy his needs.

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice verse 13?

01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:48.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sustained Paul.

01:03:48.786 --> 01:03:50.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave him power.

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:54.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Paul did face
those adverse circumstances,

01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:57.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still able to be content,

01:03:57.712 --> 01:04:02.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain inner joy,
and carry out his ministry.

01:04:04.093 --> 01:04:08.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can you and I
learn from Paul’s example?

01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:13.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that we too might face
hunger for a variety of reasons.

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:16.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, food shortages

01:04:16.564 --> 01:04:21.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this could result from civil unrest
or an economic crisis.

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:24.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
World events today
have caused many to lose their jobs

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:27.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world,
including our brothers.

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:30.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a personal economic setback

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may force us to live on less.

01:04:33.873 --> 01:04:37.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hunger can also result from persecution.

01:04:38.086 --> 01:04:41.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When many of our brothers
were put in Nazi concentration camps,

01:04:41.506 --> 01:04:46.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depriving them of adequate food
was one of the diabolical methods used

01:04:46.511 --> 01:04:49.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an effort to break their integrity.

01:04:49.598 --> 01:04:53.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even when it comes
to theocratic pursuits,

01:04:53.351 --> 01:04:58.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some who move to serve where the need
is greater are forced to make adjustments

01:04:58.148 --> 01:05:01.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and must learn to be content with less.

01:05:01.902 --> 01:05:05.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, really, in any number of situations,

01:05:05.322 --> 01:05:09.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and I could experience a lack of food

01:05:09.159 --> 01:05:11.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even hunger,

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:15.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that could make us
feel anxious and distressed.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:20.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the antidote is trust

01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:24.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reliance on Jehovah.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:28.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when we do that,
it helps us to remain calm

01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:32.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to take things one day at a time.

01:05:33.392 --> 01:05:36.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When inflation hit in his country,
one father said,

01:05:36.895 --> 01:05:41.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My daily prayer was simply
that God would ‘give us today

01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:44.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our bread for this day’

01:05:44.653 --> 01:05:47.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order for us to survive.”

01:05:49.408 --> 01:05:54.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must also be grateful
for whatever Jehovah provides.

01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:57.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that same father went to the food line
to purchase items,

01:05:57.499 --> 01:06:00.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said that one time
the only thing they had left

01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:02.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was something he didn’t like.

01:06:02.963 --> 01:06:05.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did he do?

01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:08.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I didn’t like it,

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:10.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it was food.

01:06:10.846 --> 01:06:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what we ate that night.”

01:06:14.224 --> 01:06:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was grateful
to Jehovah for providing it.

01:06:19.271 --> 01:06:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, perhaps right now,
we may be in a position

01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:25.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we only eat what we like.

01:06:25.152 --> 01:06:28.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if circumstances change,

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:32.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could we adjust and still be grateful?

01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:37.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it reassuring that we
are cared for by a God

01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:40.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gives us what we need?

01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:46.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, it is important that we
utilize the resources Jehovah provides.

01:06:47.299 --> 01:06:50.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like you to watch the following video.

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you do, note which provisions

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:57.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped our sister to rejoice
despite experiencing hunger.

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here in Venezuela,
long before the crisis,

01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there weren’t so many financial problems
like we have today.

01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:26.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could go to the stores, we could buy

01:07:26.213 --> 01:07:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the amount of food we wanted,

01:07:28.132 --> 01:07:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and life was peaceful.

01:07:36.307 --> 01:07:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us,
the situation started to get really bad

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five years ago.

01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to get any food at all,

01:07:45.733 --> 01:07:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even basic items.

01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it came time to buy something,
well, it was all gone.

01:07:53.324 --> 01:07:55.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were two elders that,

01:07:55.034 --> 01:07:57.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say,
were checking on me almost daily

01:07:57.662 --> 01:08:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—always asking
how much food I needed.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I prepared it and served it,
my main concern

01:08:05.127 --> 01:08:07.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that my children would get enough.

01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:14.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always gave them more food.

01:08:15.721 --> 01:08:17.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though
my youngest boy would ask,

01:08:17.682 --> 01:08:21.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mommy, is that
what you’re going to eat?”

01:08:21.144 --> 01:08:25.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would tell him,
“Yes, dear, I’m fine with this.”

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he would say,
“I don’t think so.”

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would think, ‘I can handle this,’

01:08:34.365 --> 01:08:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the amount that I was eating
just wasn’t enough for my body.

01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:49.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Sunday morning, during the meeting,
I wasn’t feeling very well but,

01:08:49.547 --> 01:08:52.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to Jehovah,
my daughter was nearby.

01:08:52.216 --> 01:08:53.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came to, she said,

01:08:53.927 --> 01:08:56.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, you fainted three times!”

01:08:56.387 --> 01:08:58.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “That can’t be!”

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:03.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brothers
immediately took me to the doctor.

01:09:03.019 --> 01:09:06.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was diagnosed
as having severe malnutrition.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:11.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers began a plan of action:

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:14.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought food
that was already prepared

01:09:14.572 --> 01:09:17.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in fact, they would sit
by me until I finished my food.

01:09:19.035 --> 01:09:20.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have not yet

01:09:20.662 --> 01:09:24.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fully recovered my body weight,
because I was a little heavier.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But healthwise,
I have felt very well.

01:09:30.004 --> 01:09:32.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders were always looking after me,

01:09:32.757 --> 01:09:35.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that boosted my energy.

01:09:35.218 --> 01:09:37.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And definitely,
I never lost my joy.

01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s all thanks to Jehovah!

01:09:44.227 --> 01:09:47.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to him because he
is the One who sustains me.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:50.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He clothes me, he feeds me,
and he gives me great friends.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:53.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what Jehovah gives me.

01:09:59.534 --> 01:10:02.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the provisions
that helped our sister?

01:10:02.454 --> 01:10:06.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, her relationship with Jehovah

01:10:06.082 --> 01:10:09.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she saw the importance
of staying close to him

01:10:09.002 --> 01:10:11.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and regularly attending her meetings

01:10:11.671 --> 01:10:15.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then, of course, the brotherhood.

01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:19.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t it comforting to see
how attentive the elders were,

01:10:19.638 --> 01:10:23.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making daily checks on her,
providing food for her and her family,

01:10:23.308 --> 01:10:26.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even making sure
she ate enough as well?

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s these same provisions

01:10:29.773 --> 01:10:34.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,
receiving relief from the brotherhood,

01:10:34.486 --> 01:10:39.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as holding fast to our hope
—that can help us to rejoice

01:10:39.074 --> 01:10:42.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any periods of hunger.

01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:44.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We agree.

01:10:44.162 --> 01:10:48.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced
of what Paul said at Philippians 4:12.

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:53.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can and does
provide life’s necessities

01:10:53.046 --> 01:10:56.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all circumstances.

01:10:56.967 --> 01:11:01.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When facing hunger,
it is natural to be concerned

01:11:01.179 --> 01:11:04.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our own welfare
and that of our loved ones.

01:11:04.558 --> 01:11:06.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, as we’ve seen,

01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is possible to rejoice

01:11:09.479 --> 01:11:12.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any hunger we may experience.

01:11:12.566 --> 01:11:14.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the key?

01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:16.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn the secret.

01:11:16.778 --> 01:11:19.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone likes to be in on a secret,

01:11:19.406 --> 01:11:23.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah is more than happy
to reveal this one to us,

01:11:23.869 --> 01:11:26.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we must rely on him

01:11:26.705 --> 01:11:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how he acts in our behalf.

01:11:30.793 --> 01:11:34.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How pleased Jehovah must be
when his servants remain

01:11:34.546 --> 01:11:37.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal and joyful, trusting

01:11:37.508 --> 01:11:40.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will never abandon them!

01:11:42.179 --> 01:11:46.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

01:11:46.016 --> 01:11:49.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of the symposium,

01:11:49.144 --> 01:11:52.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice
Despite . . . Nakedness.”

01:11:59.905 --> 01:12:04.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to rejoice
despite experiencing difficult trials?

01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus far, we’ve seen how the apostle Paul

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:11.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintained his joy despite tribulation,

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:14.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distress, persecution, or even hunger.

01:12:14.712 --> 01:12:18.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt this has been
an encouragement to you because many of you

01:12:18.257 --> 01:12:22.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have or are
going through those very things.

01:12:22.428 --> 01:12:26.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about situations
where we lose everything

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:29.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of disasters or civil unrest?

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can Paul’s experience help us in that?

01:12:32.688 --> 01:12:36.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme scripture at Romans 8:35

01:12:36.525 --> 01:12:39.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quotes Paul,
stating that not even “nakedness”

01:12:39.945 --> 01:12:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can “separate us
from the love of the Christ.”

01:12:42.865 --> 01:12:46.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul had firsthand experience
with that as well.

01:12:46.077 --> 01:12:51.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to 2 Corinthians 11:27.

01:12:51.082 --> 01:12:54.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice how he describes his trials

01:12:54.085 --> 01:12:57.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 11:27

01:12:57.421 --> 01:13:01.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being “in labor and toil,
in sleepless nights often,

01:13:01.425 --> 01:13:05.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in hunger and thirst,
frequently without food,

01:13:05.263 --> 01:13:08.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in cold and lacking clothing,”

01:13:08.099 --> 01:13:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “nakedness,” as the footnote says.

01:13:11.227 --> 01:13:15.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul’s lack of clothing
was not due to laziness on his part.

01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:19.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know from the Scriptures that Paul
worked hard to care for his needs.

01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:23.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, being cold and lacking clothing

01:13:23.447 --> 01:13:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was due to things
he experienced in his ministry.

01:13:27.243 --> 01:13:31.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, remember the occasion
when Paul was on board the ship

01:13:31.372 --> 01:13:33.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was driven and shipwrecked

01:13:33.374 --> 01:13:36.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by that most violent wind
on the Mediterranean.

01:13:36.502 --> 01:13:39.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the ship broke to pieces,
Paul and the others

01:13:39.964 --> 01:13:44.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hung on to pieces of wood
and the pieces of the ship,

01:13:44.385 --> 01:13:47.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may have reached land
with little or no clothing on.

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:51.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, remember the people of Malta
had to build a fire

01:13:51.142 --> 01:13:53.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to warm the cold survivors.

01:13:53.561 --> 01:13:58.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On other occasions, Paul escaped for his life
with just the clothes on his back.

01:13:58.316 --> 01:14:00.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times, he was beaten or stoned,

01:14:00.818 --> 01:14:03.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which surely ripped his clothes to shreds.

01:14:03.696 --> 01:14:06.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at Acts 16:22,

01:14:06.324 --> 01:14:09.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read of the account
where “the civil magistrates,”

01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:12.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says, “after tearing
the garments off [of Paul],

01:14:12.372 --> 01:14:17.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave the command to beat [him] with rods,”
and then “threw [him] into prison.”

01:14:17.377 --> 01:14:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these accounts help us
to better understand Paul’s words

01:14:21.798 --> 01:14:25.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 4:11

01:14:25.718 --> 01:14:28.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 4:11.

01:14:28.721 --> 01:14:31.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Down to this very hour

01:14:31.432 --> 01:14:36.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we continue to hunger and thirst
and to be poorly clothed

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:39.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to be beaten
and to be homeless.”

01:14:39.607 --> 01:14:43.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite these circumstances,
what did Paul encourage

01:14:43.737 --> 01:14:45.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his fellow Christians to do?

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 16.

01:14:47.782 --> 01:14:52.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I urge you, therefore,
become imitators of me.”

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:57.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, he encouraged them to imitate
his example—rejoice despite trials.

01:14:57.292 --> 01:15:01.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 12:12,
we read where he tells us to:

01:15:01.004 --> 01:15:03.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in the hope. . . .

01:15:03.048 --> 01:15:05.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share with the holy ones
according to their needs.”

01:15:05.383 --> 01:15:08.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Paul was able to rejoice and help others

01:15:08.595 --> 01:15:12.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when experiencing great loss himself.

01:15:12.933 --> 01:15:17.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of our dear brothers and sisters
have been affected by terrible disasters.

01:15:17.938 --> 01:15:20.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just consider a few over the past year:

01:15:20.815 --> 01:15:24.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
earthquakes in Albania,
the Philippines,

01:15:24.903 --> 01:15:26.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Puerto Rico, and elsewhere;

01:15:26.905 --> 01:15:31.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
severe flooding in Congo,
Spain, the United States;

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:36.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hurricanes and typhoons
in the Bahamas and the Philippines;

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:40.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
terrible fires in Australia
and the United States.

01:15:40.419 --> 01:15:42.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the list goes on and on.

01:15:42.462 --> 01:15:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, see, the result of these
and many other disasters

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that our brothers and sisters,
some of you,

01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:51.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had to flee their homes
in the middle of the night

01:15:51.722 --> 01:15:53.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just the clothes on their backs.

01:15:53.765 --> 01:15:58.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or in other situations, the disaster
destroyed all of their belongings.

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:02.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It pains us when we hear those reports.

01:16:02.733 --> 01:16:05.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you dear brothers and sisters
who are going through these things,

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:09.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please know that we
keep you in our prayers.

01:16:09.823 --> 01:16:14.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even in those circumstances,
our brothers continue to rejoice.

01:16:14.828 --> 01:16:17.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that possible?

01:16:17.331 --> 01:16:19.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you watch the following video,

01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:23.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which provisions
helped our brother and sister

01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:28.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite a period
of inadequate clothing.

01:16:38.435 --> 01:16:41.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one thing you have to understand
about living in New York City

01:16:41.522 --> 01:16:43.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it’s a very fast-paced life.

01:16:45.192 --> 01:16:48.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve got to keep up with that lifestyle.

01:16:49.154 --> 01:16:50.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were doing pretty fine,

01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:54.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were
happy pioneering, working

01:16:54.535 --> 01:16:57.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just trying to survive in New York.

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that you
usually have to worry about

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:03.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is your safety
—being careful of your surroundings.

01:17:03.836 --> 01:17:08.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But hurricanes are just something
we never considered;

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s something we
never had to worry about.

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:18.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day when we first heard the warning,

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was raining outside and kind of windy.

01:17:20.561 --> 01:17:25.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw the water coming into the parking lot
where our apartment was,

01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s when I realized
something was about to happen.

01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:36.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got out with the clothes on our back.

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:39.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just total devastation.

01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:42.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You lose everything

01:17:42.374 --> 01:17:44.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one single night.

01:17:45.753 --> 01:17:48.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had any thought that water

01:17:48.339 --> 01:17:51.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would come into our place and destroy
everything from our material possessions

01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:53.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our clothes.

01:17:53.344 --> 01:17:57.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I truly felt
what it was like to be destitute.

01:17:57.014 --> 01:17:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just broke my heart.

01:17:58.641 --> 01:17:59.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all I could do

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was wonder, ‘Where do my wife
and I go from here?’

01:18:05.606 --> 01:18:08.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assembly was scheduled for that weekend.

01:18:08.276 --> 01:18:10.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even have

01:18:10.278 --> 01:18:11.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a suit jacket or a tie.

01:18:11.779 --> 01:18:16.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I probably took for granted
something as simple as clothing.

01:18:16.367 --> 01:18:17.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had it.

01:18:20.204 --> 01:18:24.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers and sisters stepped in
to assist in so many different ways.

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:28.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard a knock on the door that Friday

01:18:28.588 --> 01:18:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—three suits

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shoes!

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:36.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They purchased clothing for us.

01:18:36.971 --> 01:18:39.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a most unbelievable experience.

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:42.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These friends gave us big hugs
and gave us envelopes.

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:44.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were clothed by Jehovah’s love.

01:18:46.272 --> 01:18:50.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to go to our assembly
and enjoy taking in spiritual food,

01:18:50.318 --> 01:18:52.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we were in that situation.

01:18:53.988 --> 01:18:57.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we lost everything physically,

01:18:57.075 --> 01:19:00.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were still able to keep on pioneering,
which we have been doing up to this day.

01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:04.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made a promise.

01:19:04.165 --> 01:19:07.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep seeking
first his Kingdom,

01:19:07.293 --> 01:19:10.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything else he will take care of.

01:19:10.463 --> 01:19:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where my joy comes from.

01:19:14.759 --> 01:19:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what type of tribulation
you go through in your life,

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:20.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even if it’s to the point of nakedness,

01:19:20.515 --> 01:19:24.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will never ever be able to stop

01:19:24.018 --> 01:19:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or cut off the relationship
that we have with our God, Jehovah.

01:19:33.278 --> 01:19:35.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what helped this couple?

01:19:35.488 --> 01:19:37.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They lost everything in one night.

01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:40.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were unsure what they would do,
how they would go on.

01:19:40.827 --> 01:19:42.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice their resolve?

01:19:42.871 --> 01:19:47.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Brian said, ‘No matter
what tribulation we experience,

01:19:47.542 --> 01:19:49.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘even to the point of nakedness,

01:19:49.627 --> 01:19:53.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will never cut us off
from our relationship with Jehovah.’

01:19:53.214 --> 01:19:56.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were touched by how
their brothers stepped in to help them.

01:19:56.342 --> 01:20:00.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They kept their hope in Jehovah
and the future alive.

01:20:00.221 --> 01:20:02.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from this?

01:20:02.724 --> 01:20:05.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn that when we
are going through trials,

01:20:05.393 --> 01:20:09.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even those trials that cause us
to lose our possessions

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:13.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be inadequately clothed,
we can maintain our joy

01:20:13.693 --> 01:20:16.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the three things
we’ve been discussing:

01:20:16.696 --> 01:20:19.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,

01:20:19.491 --> 01:20:22.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receiving relief from our brotherhood,

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and holding fast to our hope.

01:20:25.622 --> 01:20:30.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of you immediately respond
to help your brothers and sisters

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you see a need,
and we appreciate that so much.

01:20:34.047 --> 01:20:38.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Disasters are on the increase,
both in frequency and intensity,

01:20:38.635 --> 01:20:43.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus the need to provide relief
for our brothers continues to increase.

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we commend you
and thank you for what you do.

01:20:47.686 --> 01:20:51.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, some of you volunteer
to go into areas to help.

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:55.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after Hurricane Dorian
in the Bahamas,

01:20:55.777 --> 01:20:57.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Witness pilots transported

01:20:57.779 --> 01:21:02.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 700 volunteer workers
into those affected areas.

01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:07.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you assist your brothers
and sisters right in your own area.

01:21:07.372 --> 01:21:10.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
in Congo, many of our brothers

01:21:10.292 --> 01:21:12.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to flee their homes and villages

01:21:12.502 --> 01:21:16.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just the clothes on their backs
because of civil unrest.

01:21:16.423 --> 01:21:18.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With all their possessions
and livelihood gone,

01:21:18.842 --> 01:21:20.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they do?

01:21:20.844 --> 01:21:23.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, their brothers and sisters
in neighboring congregations,

01:21:23.764 --> 01:21:27.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they had limited means,
provided money,

01:21:27.434 --> 01:21:32.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food, clothing, and even housing
for their displaced brothers.

01:21:32.272 --> 01:21:37.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bolivia and Venezuela,
congregations shared meals

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or did a local distribution of food.

01:21:39.947 --> 01:21:43.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at how
our brotherhood has stepped in

01:21:43.325 --> 01:21:46.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this COVID-19 pandemic,

01:21:46.995 --> 01:21:51.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing food supplies,
relief supplies, emotional support,

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:56.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual support—congregations
and families helping one another out.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:59.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, see,
because of your self-sacrificing spirit

01:21:59.883 --> 01:22:03.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your generous donations,
you are a blessing

01:22:03.679 --> 01:22:06.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your brothers and sisters
all around the world.

01:22:06.765 --> 01:22:11.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a slap
in the face this is to Satan!

01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:13.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

01:22:13.814 --> 01:22:16.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ll remember that at Job 1:11,

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:21.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan insulted Jehovah
—and all of us who love Jehovah—

01:22:21.322 --> 01:22:24.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by insinuating that we would turn our back

01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:26.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah when going through trials.

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that at Job 1:11.

01:22:30.039 --> 01:22:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “But, for a change,
stretch out your hand

01:22:33.209 --> 01:22:35.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and strike everything he has,

01:22:35.336 --> 01:22:39.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will surely curse
you to your very face.”

01:22:39.423 --> 01:22:43.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Satan was convinced that when it
came to losing our possessions

01:22:43.803 --> 01:22:47.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or staying loyal to Jehovah,
we would choose our possessions.

01:22:47.556 --> 01:22:50.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan was convinced that when it
came to helping ourselves

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:54.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or helping somebody else,
we would choose ourselves.

01:22:54.688 --> 01:22:57.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wrong he was!

01:22:57.358 --> 01:22:59.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How angry he must be

01:22:59.819 --> 01:23:03.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he sees what is happening
in Jehovah’s organization today!

01:23:03.739 --> 01:23:07.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?
Keep making him angry.

01:23:07.368 --> 01:23:10.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to help your brothers
and sisters in need.

01:23:10.955 --> 01:23:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do, not only do we gain happiness

01:23:13.749 --> 01:23:17.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we help our brothers to rejoice as well.

01:23:17.169 --> 01:23:20.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, dear friends,
may all of us be determined

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep our joy alive
by doing those three things:

01:23:25.261 --> 01:23:28.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintaining our relationship
with Jehovah,

01:23:28.014 --> 01:23:31.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizing the love
and support of our brotherhood,

01:23:31.601 --> 01:23:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating
on our precious hope.

01:23:34.604 --> 01:23:36.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And never forget,

01:23:36.647 --> 01:23:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we continue to loyally serve
Jehovah despite nakedness

01:23:40.443 --> 01:23:45.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—despite losing all of our possessions—
we make Jehovah’s heart glad.

01:23:45.406 --> 01:23:50.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is one
of our greatest reasons for rejoicing.

01:23:51.746 --> 01:23:55.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:58.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

01:23:58.669 --> 01:24:02.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Danger.”

01:24:09.055 --> 01:24:12.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme does not end
in the form of a question.

01:24:12.725 --> 01:24:16.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it is a statement of fact.

01:24:16.854 --> 01:24:20.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can rejoice despite danger.

01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along as we look
to the example that the apostle Paul set.

01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:29.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to rejoice despite danger,

01:24:29.033 --> 01:24:32.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he faced many dangers in his ministry.

01:24:32.412 --> 01:24:36.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one verse,
he mentions eight different types

01:24:36.583 --> 01:24:41.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of dangers he faced,
including “dangers from robbers.”

01:24:41.588 --> 01:24:46.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While in Ephesus,
Paul may even have been exposed

01:24:46.217 --> 01:24:48.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wild beasts in an arena.

01:24:48.636 --> 01:24:52.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
to 2 Corinthians chapter 1,

01:24:52.807 --> 01:24:55.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 8-11.

01:25:02.734 --> 01:25:05.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what it says:

01:25:05.028 --> 01:25:07.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we do not want you to be unaware,

01:25:07.989 --> 01:25:10.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brothers, of the tribulation we experienced

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:13.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the province of Asia.”

01:25:13.495 --> 01:25:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he wrote this
while he was in Europe—Macedonia.

01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:20.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continues:

01:25:20.585 --> 01:25:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were under extreme pressure

01:25:23.713 --> 01:25:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beyond our own strength,

01:25:26.258 --> 01:25:30.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that we were very uncertain
even of our lives.

01:25:30.637 --> 01:25:35.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, we felt that we had received
 the sentence of death.

01:25:35.642 --> 01:25:39.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This was so that we would trust,

01:25:39.104 --> 01:25:44.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not in ourselves, but in the God
who raises up the dead.

01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:46.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From such a great risk of death

01:25:46.987 --> 01:25:50.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did rescue us and will rescue us,

01:25:50.782 --> 01:25:55.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and our hope is in him that he
will also continue to rescue us.

01:25:55.787 --> 01:26:00.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You also can help us
by your supplication for us,

01:26:00.584 --> 01:26:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order that many
may give thanks in our behalf

01:26:04.087 --> 01:26:08.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the favor we receive
in answer to the prayers of many.”

01:26:10.302 --> 01:26:12.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Less than a year earlier,

01:26:12.346 --> 01:26:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had written his first letter
to the Corinthians.

01:26:16.224 --> 01:26:20.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, he was in Asia,
the city of Ephesus.

01:26:20.854 --> 01:26:23.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 15th chapter of that letter,

01:26:23.774 --> 01:26:27.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 32 says:

01:26:27.444 --> 01:26:32.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If like other men,
I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus,

01:26:32.449 --> 01:26:35.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what good is it to me?”

01:26:35.077 --> 01:26:37.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His comments would fit an experience

01:26:37.621 --> 01:26:41.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with literal wild beasts in the arena.

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:46.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Paul’s hope
in the resurrection strengthened him,

01:26:46.088 --> 01:26:51.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he said: “This was so that we would trust,

01:26:51.009 --> 01:26:55.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in ourselves,
but in the God who raises up the dead.”

01:26:57.474 --> 01:27:01.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was also encouraged
and strengthened by fellow Christians.

01:27:01.812 --> 01:27:06.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “You also can help us

01:27:06.608 --> 01:27:09.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by your supplication for us,

01:27:09.403 --> 01:27:12.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order that many
may give thanks in our behalf

01:27:12.823 --> 01:27:17.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the favor we receive
in answer to the prayers of many.”

01:27:19.079 --> 01:27:23.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation,
we also enjoy a warm brotherhood,

01:27:23.667 --> 01:27:27.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which provides assistance
and support in numerous ways.

01:27:27.588 --> 01:27:30.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point in his ministry,

01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:32.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul and his traveling companions

01:27:32.134 --> 01:27:35.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt “extreme pressure”

01:27:35.554 --> 01:27:40.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were “uncertain even of [their] lives.”

01:27:40.392 --> 01:27:43.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did Paul find support and relief?

01:27:43.771 --> 01:27:46.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was encouraged and consoled

01:27:46.732 --> 01:27:50.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fellow Christians who came to his aid.

01:27:50.069 --> 01:27:53.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When natural disasters
or other calamities strike,

01:27:53.989 --> 01:27:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time and again our Christian brothers
are the first on the scene

01:27:58.828 --> 01:28:02.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to render needed assistance
materially and spiritually

01:28:02.456 --> 01:28:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fellow Christians
as well as to others in need.

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Christians are not exposed

01:28:09.922 --> 01:28:12.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wild beasts in arenas.

01:28:12.383 --> 01:28:15.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, like Paul,

01:28:15.094 --> 01:28:18.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can rejoice

01:28:18.055 --> 01:28:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite danger that we may face.

01:28:21.851 --> 01:28:25.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any of us can face “dangers from robbers,”

01:28:25.396 --> 01:28:27.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the threat of physical assault,

01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in times of civil unrest.

01:28:30.693 --> 01:28:34.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible foretold that in these “last days,”

01:28:34.363 --> 01:28:38.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people would be “fierce,
without love of goodness.”

01:28:38.993 --> 01:28:42.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

01:28:42.163 --> 01:28:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which provisions helped one family

01:28:44.874 --> 01:28:47.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite such dangers.

01:29:01.849 --> 01:29:03.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Caracas and live

01:29:03.518 --> 01:29:05.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an area of the city called Petare.

01:29:05.561 --> 01:29:07.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Petare, I have to live

01:29:07.563 --> 01:29:09.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with violence and delinquency.

01:29:11.317 --> 01:29:14.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years ago,
we lost a pioneer sister who,

01:29:14.278 --> 01:29:16.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sadly, was hit by a bullet.

01:29:17.156 --> 01:29:20.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, something like that
also happened to my son.

01:29:21.828 --> 01:29:23.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a confrontation

01:29:23.621 --> 01:29:26.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the neighborhood,
and a stray bullet hit my son

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:29.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and killed him instantly.

01:29:34.424 --> 01:29:36.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That left such a void.

01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:40.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It hurt me to go into his room
and see his empty bed.

01:29:40.471 --> 01:29:42.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then to see his things:

01:29:42.515 --> 01:29:45.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his shoes, his favorite clothes.

01:29:45.768 --> 01:29:48.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see them in the wardrobe—

01:29:48.021 --> 01:29:50.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Crying was inevitable.

01:29:52.066 --> 01:29:55.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These situations were very difficult 
to deal with at the time.

01:29:59.657 --> 01:30:01.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as the congregation

01:30:01.367 --> 01:30:04.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found out about the situation,

01:30:04.412 --> 01:30:07.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right away they gave me support.

01:30:07.082 --> 01:30:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were there to help care
for all the things you need to do

01:30:10.085 --> 01:30:12.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you lose a loved one.

01:30:14.464 --> 01:30:17.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After going through all that,
I was very afraid

01:30:17.425 --> 01:30:19.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue
going out in field service.

01:30:19.803 --> 01:30:21.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feared for my life

01:30:21.429 --> 01:30:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the life of my family.

01:30:25.433 --> 01:30:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

01:30:27.102 --> 01:30:30.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave me
practical wisdom to continue.

01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when I’m alone meditating
and thinking about my son,

01:30:39.489 --> 01:30:43.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those memories return and,
of course, I have a setback,

01:30:43.618 --> 01:30:45.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so to speak,

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:48.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I begin to cry again.

01:30:48.623 --> 01:30:52.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keeping clearly in mind
the promise of the resurrection

01:30:52.752 --> 01:30:55.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what motivates
me to keep going.

01:30:59.384 --> 01:31:01.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An account that I really like

01:31:01.094 --> 01:31:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I always keep in mind
is the account about Lazarus.

01:31:04.848 --> 01:31:07.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, Martha uses an expression.

01:31:07.726 --> 01:31:11.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says, ‘I know
he’ll rise on the last day.’

01:31:11.813 --> 01:31:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the same confidence
that I have in Jehovah.

01:31:14.691 --> 01:31:16.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that my son will rise.

01:31:16.693 --> 01:31:18.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give him to me.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time
that this terrible thing happened,

01:31:26.995 --> 01:31:29.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s true that I lost my joy for a time.

01:31:33.919 --> 01:31:36.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later after the mourning passes,

01:31:36.296 --> 01:31:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resurrection hope gives us joy.

01:31:38.382 --> 01:31:40.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if

01:31:40.092 --> 01:31:42.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah speaks to me,
saying, ‘Keep calm.’

01:31:42.386 --> 01:31:44.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if he gives me a gentle pat,

01:31:44.638 --> 01:31:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling me to ‘keep going
and that’s what will happen to you.

01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep faithful, and continue loyal,
and I will give him back to you.’

01:31:58.068 --> 01:32:00.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what helped this family

01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite danger?

01:32:02.573 --> 01:32:06.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer, their hope in the resurrection,

01:32:06.326 --> 01:32:11.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the supportive brotherhood
and, of course, Jehovah’s spirit.

01:32:11.331 --> 01:32:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which provisions from Jehovah
are helping you to rejoice

01:32:15.711 --> 01:32:18.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the dangers you may have to face?

01:32:18.964 --> 01:32:22.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your relationship with Jehovah,

01:32:22.259 --> 01:32:24.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brotherhood,

01:32:24.261 --> 01:32:28.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hope, or something else?

01:32:28.182 --> 01:32:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these last days,
with “critical times hard to deal with,”

01:32:33.187 --> 01:32:36.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are being admonished
to rejoice in the hope

01:32:36.315 --> 01:32:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of deliverance from danger.

01:32:39.068 --> 01:32:43.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We long for the end of this wicked system,
just as Habakkuk longed for relief

01:32:43.948 --> 01:32:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from wickedness in his day.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:50.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Habakkuk chapter 1.

01:32:50.496 --> 01:32:55.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feel the stress that he felt
as a result of the violence, quarreling,

01:32:55.501 --> 01:32:57.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and oppression that surrounded him.

01:32:59.088 --> 01:33:03.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asks: “How long, O Jehovah . . . ?

01:33:03.884 --> 01:33:07.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long must I ask
for help from violence . . . ?

01:33:07.471 --> 01:33:10.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:12.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And why do you tolerate oppression?

01:33:12.393 --> 01:33:16.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are destruction and violence before me?

01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:20.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”

01:33:20.651 --> 01:33:25.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Why?
Why? Why?

01:33:25.656 --> 01:33:27.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long?

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:32.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But note what he recorded
in chapter 2, verse 3:

01:33:34.457 --> 01:33:39.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the vision is yet
for its appointed time,

01:33:39.045 --> 01:33:44.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it is rushing toward its end,
and it will not lie.

01:33:44.008 --> 01:33:46.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if it should delay,

01:33:46.636 --> 01:33:49.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“keep in expectation of it!

01:33:49.513 --> 01:33:52.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For it will without fail come true.

01:33:52.266 --> 01:33:55.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will not be late!”

01:33:55.478 --> 01:33:59.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Habakkuk, we trust in Jehovah

01:33:59.232 --> 01:34:03.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the assurance
that He will soon end violence.

01:34:03.986 --> 01:34:08.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk took the initiative
to draw close to Jehovah,

01:34:08.908 --> 01:34:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his trusted Friend and Father.

01:34:11.702 --> 01:34:14.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not just fret over his situation,

01:34:14.789 --> 01:34:16.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relying on his own understanding.

01:34:16.916 --> 01:34:21.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he prayed
about his feelings and worries.

01:34:21.879 --> 01:34:25.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good example for us.

01:34:25.383 --> 01:34:30.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his resolve in chapter 3 and verse 18.

01:34:31.764 --> 01:34:33.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he says:

01:34:33.933 --> 01:34:38.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As for me, I will exult in Jehovah;

01:34:38.813 --> 01:34:43.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.”

01:34:45.695 --> 01:34:48.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jehovah, the “Hearer of prayer,”

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:51.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invites us to show our trust

01:34:51.367 --> 01:34:54.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by prayerfully sharing our concerns with him.

01:34:54.746 --> 01:34:59.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah didn’t reprove Habakkuk
for expressing his anxieties.

01:34:59.292 --> 01:35:01.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had them recorded,

01:35:01.294 --> 01:35:05.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely to show that it’s only natural
for us to have such feelings at times.

01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:09.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah wants us to call out to him.

01:35:09.427 --> 01:35:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so will help us
to experience Jehovah’s response

01:35:13.723 --> 01:35:18.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his warm embrace
by means of his kind guidance.

01:35:18.728 --> 01:35:22.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will help us
to know his thoughts

01:35:22.524 --> 01:35:25.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what afflicts us.

01:35:25.443 --> 01:35:28.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heartfelt prayers

01:35:28.113 --> 01:35:32.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are one of the deepest expressions
of our trust in God.

01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:36.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice in knowing that Jehovah

01:35:36.329 --> 01:35:40.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is eager to deliver us
from all forms of danger!

01:35:42.711 --> 01:35:45.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Schafer,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:35:45.755 --> 01:35:49.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present 
the final talk of this symposium,

01:35:49.092 --> 01:35:53.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Sword.”

01:36:01.104 --> 01:36:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During his first imprisonment in Rome
from about 59 to 61 C.E.,

01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:10.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul was permitted
to stay in his own hired house,

01:36:10.155 --> 01:36:12.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though he was constantly
guarded by a soldier.

01:36:12.991 --> 01:36:14.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those two years,

01:36:14.993 --> 01:36:17.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he preached to everyone who came to him

01:36:17.329 --> 01:36:20.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wrote inspired letters
to the Ephesians,

01:36:20.624 --> 01:36:25.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians, Colossians, Philemon,
and evidently Hebrews too.

01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:29.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Paul was apparently released.

01:36:29.257 --> 01:36:31.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he could renew his missionary activity.

01:36:31.927 --> 01:36:34.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could write to Timothy,
who was serving in Ephesus,

01:36:34.554 --> 01:36:37.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Titus, who was serving on Crete.

01:36:37.265 --> 01:36:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, though, Roman Emperor Nero
reportedly blamed Christians

01:36:41.353 --> 01:36:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the fire that destroyed much of Rome,

01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:48.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and once again Paul found himself in chains.

01:36:48.986 --> 01:36:52.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After decades of faithful Christian service

01:36:52.906 --> 01:36:55.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the year was 65 C.E.),

01:36:55.867 --> 01:36:57.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did Paul feel?

01:36:57.911 --> 01:37:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get our answer by reading
from his second letter to Timothy,

01:37:02.207 --> 01:37:04.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which he wrote from prison.

01:37:04.334 --> 01:37:08.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to 2 Timothy chapter 4.

01:37:08.839 --> 01:37:13.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the men
who apprehended Paul carry swords?

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt.

01:37:14.845 --> 01:37:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did seeing those swords remind Paul

01:37:17.848 --> 01:37:20.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how King Herod Agrippa I had executed James,

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brother of John, by sword?

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:25.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine.

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:28.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But from this excerpt from 2 Timothy,

01:37:28.358 --> 01:37:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Paul sensed
that his own execution was imminent.

01:37:33.072 --> 01:37:36.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also see something else.

01:37:36.533 --> 01:37:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we see the three things
that strengthened Paul

01:37:40.913 --> 01:37:43.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he faced execution.

01:37:43.082 --> 01:37:48.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me 2 Timothy 4:6-8:

01:37:49.672 --> 01:37:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am already being
poured out like a drink offering,

01:37:53.676 --> 01:37:57.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the time for my releasing is imminent,”

01:37:57.888 --> 01:38:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is to say, his death,

01:38:00.224 --> 01:38:02.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would allow
for his eventual resurrection

01:38:02.768 --> 01:38:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Christ’s heavenly Kingdom.

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 7 continues:
“I have fought the fine fight,

01:38:09.024 --> 01:38:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have run the race to the finish.”

01:38:12.194 --> 01:38:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The finish”—yes, Paul sensed
that he was approaching

01:38:16.615 --> 01:38:21.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a triumphant end to his personal race.

01:38:22.246 --> 01:38:26.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continues:
“I have observed the faith.

01:38:26.167 --> 01:38:29.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From this time on, there is reserved for me

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:31.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the crown of righteousness.”

01:38:31.422 --> 01:38:35.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we see Paul’s strong hope.

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:39.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he continues:
“Which the Lord, the righteous judge,

01:38:39.764 --> 01:38:43.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will give me as a reward in that day.”

01:38:43.893 --> 01:38:47.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see Paul’s strong relationship

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:50.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah in this expression?

01:38:50.232 --> 01:38:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his unflagging confidence that God’s Son
would bestow the promised reward?

01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:59.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he says:
“Yet not to me only,

01:38:59.283 --> 01:39:03.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to all those
who have loved his manifestation.”

01:39:04.914 --> 01:39:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul loved his Christian brothers,
and he didn’t forget them.

01:39:10.837 --> 01:39:15.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how Paul was able to rejoice
despite the threat of death

01:39:15.258 --> 01:39:18.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his brothers, his relationship
with Jehovah, and his hope.

01:39:18.803 --> 01:39:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that Paul wanted to die.

01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course he would have preferred
to live on and keep serving Jehovah

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together with his 
Christian brothers and sisters.

01:39:25.268 --> 01:39:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he faced death with courage,

01:39:28.104 --> 01:39:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he rejoiced in the reward
that he knew was reserved for him.

01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:37.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Paul, we too
can rejoice despite the threat of death.

01:39:37.238 --> 01:39:39.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back
to our theme text at Romans 8:35.

01:39:45.121 --> 01:39:49.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the answer
to the two questions Paul poses here,

01:39:49.208 --> 01:39:52.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely: “Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

01:39:52.211 --> 01:39:54.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will tribulation or distress or persecution 

01:39:54.297 --> 01:39:56.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?”

01:39:56.299 --> 01:40:00.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is found in verses 38 and 39:

01:40:00.929 --> 01:40:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am convinced that neither death

01:40:05.934 --> 01:40:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor life nor angels nor governments

01:40:08.478 --> 01:40:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor things now here nor things to come
nor powers nor height nor depth

01:40:11.814 --> 01:40:15.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor any other creation will be able

01:40:15.193 --> 01:40:20.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[yes, death is not able] to separate us

01:40:20.198 --> 01:40:24.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God’s love
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

01:40:24.953 --> 01:40:27.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A temporary pause in the grave

01:40:27.664 --> 01:40:31.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot extinguish Jehovah’s love
for his servants.

01:40:31.167 --> 01:40:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah still love
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?

01:40:34.504 --> 01:40:38.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about Sarah, Rebekah,
Job, Moses, Daniel?

01:40:38.133 --> 01:40:40.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about all those
who have died in prisons,

01:40:40.218 --> 01:40:42.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in concentration camps
on account of their strong faith?

01:40:42.846 --> 01:40:45.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah still love them?

01:40:45.098 --> 01:40:47.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course he does.

01:40:47.392 --> 01:40:50.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he still loves the hundreds
of brothers and sisters

01:40:50.895 --> 01:40:54.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have died in recent months
as a result of COVID-19.

01:40:54.816 --> 01:40:58.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He still loves your grandma,
your dad, your sister.

01:40:58.278 --> 01:41:00.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He keeps them in his memory.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll call them back to life.

01:41:02.115 --> 01:41:05.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this fact helps us,
dear friends, when we face

01:41:05.619 --> 01:41:10.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the threat of death by sword as Paul did.

01:41:10.624 --> 01:41:13.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,

01:41:13.502 --> 01:41:15.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which specific provisions

01:41:15.754 --> 01:41:18.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah helped
our Brother Baite Michael Dugbe

01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:23.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite
facing the threat of death.

01:41:33.438 --> 01:41:37.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When everything falls apart

01:41:37.984 --> 01:41:40.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when everything
around you is chaotic,

01:41:40.904 --> 01:41:44.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

01:41:46.451 --> 01:41:49.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Baite Michael Dugbe.

01:41:49.079 --> 01:41:53.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in 1980.

01:41:53.083 --> 01:41:55.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in Monrovia

01:41:55.168 --> 01:41:58.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the war was an amazing time.

01:41:59.131 --> 01:42:01.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had wonderful parents.

01:42:01.258 --> 01:42:05.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We grew up in a nice house,
and we went to a great school.

01:42:06.722 --> 01:42:10.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
everything changed overnight.

01:42:10.726 --> 01:42:14.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were reports of rebels

01:42:14.479 --> 01:42:17.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to take over the government.

01:42:17.065 --> 01:42:20.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those reports alone

01:42:20.152 --> 01:42:22.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made people panic.

01:42:23.655 --> 01:42:25.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Businesses started to close down.

01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:28.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Services were shut down

01:42:28.869 --> 01:42:32.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the lights, the power, the water—
everything stopped.

01:42:33.332 --> 01:42:37.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next few years were really unstable.

01:42:37.961 --> 01:42:41.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1996, things again fell apart completely.

01:42:41.465 --> 01:42:43.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was all-out war.

01:42:43.509 --> 01:42:46.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the rebels were in the city.

01:42:46.929 --> 01:42:49.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot of looting going on.

01:42:50.224 --> 01:42:52.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot of shooting.

01:42:52.601 --> 01:42:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rebels—they were known for torture

01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:58.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if people would not agree to fight with them.

01:43:05.072 --> 01:43:06.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a situation like that,

01:43:06.615 --> 01:43:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a lot of fear;
there’s a lot of panic.

01:43:10.286 --> 01:43:13.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when your fear level rises,

01:43:13.497 --> 01:43:17.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way to deal with it is prayer
—prayer to Jehovah,

01:43:17.751 --> 01:43:21.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him specifically for direction

01:43:21.255 --> 01:43:23.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what to do next.

01:43:23.257 --> 01:43:25.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the fighting escalated

01:43:25.342 --> 01:43:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it got closer to where we lived,
it was no longer safe.

01:43:28.637 --> 01:43:32.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to flee,
and we ended up at the branch office.

01:43:32.933 --> 01:43:36.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were very loving;
they took really good care of us.

01:43:38.355 --> 01:43:40.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual activities

01:43:40.024 --> 01:43:42.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they made sure we kept up with that.

01:43:45.571 --> 01:43:49.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back,
I’m very grateful to have survived.

01:43:49.784 --> 01:43:51.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things helped us get through.

01:43:53.204 --> 01:43:56.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
our relationship with Jehovah.

01:43:56.207 --> 01:43:59.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the only thing that keeps you stable.

01:43:59.043 --> 01:44:01.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, also, we were able to survive

01:44:01.754 --> 01:44:05.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the help
from the brothers and sisters.

01:44:05.174 --> 01:44:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those moments of trial
—that’s when you really realize

01:44:09.679 --> 01:44:12.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much you need the brotherhood.

01:44:12.598 --> 01:44:16.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a lot of joy
in my assignment at Bethel

01:44:16.811 --> 01:44:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Audio/Video Services.

01:44:18.855 --> 01:44:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the brothers and sisters
that I work with.

01:44:22.316 --> 01:44:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all thanks to Jehovah

01:44:24.861 --> 01:44:28.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I am alive and that I get
to serve him every day.

01:44:30.491 --> 01:44:35.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video reminds us that life
in this system of things is fragile.

01:44:35.413 --> 01:44:37.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice what helped Brother Dugbe

01:44:37.915 --> 01:44:41.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite the threat of death?

01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:44.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his relationship with Jehovah.

01:44:44.088 --> 01:44:48.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was his Christian brothers
who helped him to keep his hope alive

01:44:48.176 --> 01:44:51.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through regular study,
meetings, and preaching.

01:44:52.764 --> 01:44:57.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible that some of us
will have to die for our faith

01:44:57.268 --> 01:44:59.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many early Christians did

01:44:59.437 --> 01:45:01.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as some
modern-day Witnesses have done?

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:45:03.942 --> 01:45:06.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not guaranteed
a trouble-free existence

01:45:06.694 --> 01:45:08.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this system of things.

01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:13.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s the very real possibility
that we may die by illness, 

01:45:13.117 --> 01:45:17.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accident, or the other ravages
of these last days.

01:45:17.372 --> 01:45:20.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might die before the new world comes,

01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:23.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many of our dear friends already have.

01:45:23.378 --> 01:45:27.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we may be spared alive
through the great tribulation.

01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:30.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, we need to be determined

01:45:30.343 --> 01:45:34.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain faithful to Jehovah
right down to the end.

01:45:34.681 --> 01:45:39.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who has endured
to the end will be saved.”

01:45:39.477 --> 01:45:44.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we assume that the new world
will arrive before we die,

01:45:44.441 --> 01:45:49.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be unprepared
to remain loyal to the death if necessary.

01:45:49.446 --> 01:45:53.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, if we assume 
that the great tribulation will not come

01:45:53.325 --> 01:45:57.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our lifetime,
we will be unprepared for its hardships.

01:45:57.412 --> 01:46:01.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only way to be prepared
for either eventuality

01:46:01.291 --> 01:46:04.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to stay spiritually strong and alert.

01:46:04.794 --> 01:46:07.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch, therefore,” Jesus said,

01:46:07.714 --> 01:46:10.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you do not know

01:46:10.050 --> 01:46:13.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what day your Lord is coming.”

01:46:15.138 --> 01:46:17.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been good
for us to consider more closely

01:46:17.724 --> 01:46:20.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul’s strong conviction

01:46:20.519 --> 01:46:24.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as expressed at Romans 8:35.

01:46:24.481 --> 01:46:27.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have we learned from this symposium?

01:46:27.651 --> 01:46:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen how Romans 8:35-39

01:46:31.988 --> 01:46:35.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assure us that no trial of any sort

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will cause Jehovah to stop loving us.

01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:42.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that we have Jehovah’s approval
and love even while under trial

01:46:42.749 --> 01:46:46.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a key to rejoicing despite tribulation,

01:46:46.044 --> 01:46:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distress, persecution, hunger,

01:46:49.005 --> 01:46:53.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nakedness, danger, sword, or anything else.

01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:55.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, continue to draw closer

01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:59.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the One who loves you so very much.

01:46:59.516 --> 01:47:03.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strengthen your trust in Jehovah
through personal study and prayer.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep assuring your heart of his love.

01:47:06.857 --> 01:47:11.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Treasure our precious brotherhood,
and draw closer to one another.

01:47:11.612 --> 01:47:16.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cherish your God-given hope,
and meditate on “the real life” yet ahead.

01:47:16.617 --> 01:47:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, remember the inspired prayer

01:47:19.995 --> 01:47:23.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Colossians 1:11.

01:47:23.415 --> 01:47:27.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we continue doing these things,
dear friends, then, like Paul,

01:47:27.044 --> 01:47:31.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be able to rejoice
despite trials of any sort.

01:47:31.882 --> 01:47:33.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice these encouraging words

01:47:33.884 --> 01:47:37.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Colossians 1:11:

01:47:39.389 --> 01:47:41.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And may you be strengthened

01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:45.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with all power

01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:48.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to his glorious might.”

01:47:48.232 --> 01:47:52.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just how much power is there
“according to [God’s] glorious might”?

01:47:52.945 --> 01:47:56.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have to imagine
because his Word reveals what Jehovah

01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has accomplished and will yet accomplish
by means of his holy spirit

01:48:00.244 --> 01:48:02.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most powerful force there is.

01:48:02.454 --> 01:48:05.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for what purpose will he grant you this?

01:48:05.624 --> 01:48:08.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not simply so that you may endure,

01:48:08.711 --> 01:48:12.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not merely so that you may endure fully,

01:48:12.214 --> 01:48:16.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only so that you may
endure fully with patience,

01:48:16.343 --> 01:48:18.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as it says:

01:48:18.387 --> 01:48:21.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So that you may endure fully

01:48:21.015 --> 01:48:24.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with patience and joy.”

01:48:24.143 --> 01:48:26.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that assurance,

01:48:26.145 --> 01:48:30.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can endure despite any trial
no matter how difficult it is,

01:48:30.024 --> 01:48:34.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how long it lasts
because our Father’s unfailing love

01:48:34.403 --> 01:48:36.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will enable us to rejoice

01:48:36.572 --> 01:48:40.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both for all eternity and always.

01:48:42.203 --> 01:48:45.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for those strengthening talks.

01:48:45.122 --> 01:48:48.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank Jehovah
that he provides what we need

01:48:48.501 --> 01:48:50.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to safeguard our joy.

01:48:51.962 --> 01:48:56.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us now stand
and sing together song number 9,

01:48:56.258 --> 01:48:58.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Is Our King!”

01:48:58.511 --> 01:49:01.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that is song number 9.

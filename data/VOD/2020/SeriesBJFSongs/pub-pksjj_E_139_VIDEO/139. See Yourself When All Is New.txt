00:00:05 Just see yourself, just see me too; Just see us all in a world that is new.
00:00:18 Think how you’ll feel, how it will be, To live in peace, to be truly free.
00:00:30 No evil one will then prevail; Rule by our God cannot ever fail.
00:00:43 The time will have come for a new earthly start,
00:00:50 The song of our praises will pour out from our heart:
00:00:58 “We thank you, our God, for all you have done.
00:01:05 “All things are new by the rule of your Son.
00:01:11 “The fullness of our heart overflows in our song;
00:01:18 All glory and honor and praise to you belong.”
00:01:28 Now see yourself, and see me too; And look ahead to a world that is new.
00:01:40 No sight we see, no sound we hear Will cause alarm or give rise to fear.
00:01:51 All has come true, just as he said; Now over mankind, his tent is spread.
00:02:03 He now will awaken those sleeping in death;
00:02:10 Their voices will join ours with ev’ry grateful breath:
00:02:17 “We thank you, our God, for all you have done.
00:02:25 “All things are new by the rule of your Son.
00:02:31 “The fullness of our heart overflows in our song;
00:02:38 All glory and honor and praise to you belong.”

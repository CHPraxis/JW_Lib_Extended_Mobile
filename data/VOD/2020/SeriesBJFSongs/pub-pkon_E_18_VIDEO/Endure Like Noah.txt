00:00:13 Noah walked with Jehovah; he was pleasing in God’s eyes.
00:00:20 He stuck close to his family; they wanted to do what’s right.
00:00:27 They worked hard to build an ark to save them from the Flood.
00:00:34 They listened to Jehovah, and they preached to ev’ryone.
00:00:42 Noah was faithful to Jehovah, And as the Flood got closer,
00:00:51 He preached until the end.
00:00:56 If I try to be like Noah, Faithful to Jehovah,
00:01:06 I can be God’s friend.
00:01:13 When they went out preaching, there were people who made fun.
00:01:20 But Noah kept his fam’ly safe until the work was done.
00:01:27 Even though the world around them was violent and bad,
00:01:34 They endured and they found joy; they made Jehovah glad.
00:01:42 Noah was faithful to Jehovah, And as the Flood got closer,
00:01:51 He preached until the end.
00:01:56 If I try to be like Noah, Faithful to Jehovah,
00:02:05 I can be God’s friend.

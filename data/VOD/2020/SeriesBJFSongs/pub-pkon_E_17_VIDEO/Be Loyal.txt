00:00:26 My parents always tell me that they love me very much.
00:00:32 So I’ll be loyal to them, and I’ll earn their trust.
00:00:38 I’ll treat them with respect and follow all the rules
00:00:43 Because Jehovah says that’s what to do.
00:00:48 When I’m loyal to Jehovah, It makes him happy to see.
00:00:59 And when I’m loyal to Jehovah, He’ll be loyal to me.
00:01:10 Jehovah taught me right from wrong, so I’ll do my best
00:01:16 To make him happy ev’ry time I face a test.
00:01:21 Others might make fun, and some may not be kind.
00:01:27 But I’ll be loyal. I’ve made up my mind.
00:01:32 When I’m loyal to Jehovah, It makes him happy to see.
00:01:42 And when I’m loyal to Jehovah, He’ll be loyal to me.
00:01:53 When I’m loyal to Jehovah, He’ll be loyal to me.

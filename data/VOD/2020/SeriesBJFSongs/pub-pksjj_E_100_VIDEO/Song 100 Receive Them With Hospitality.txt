00:00:06 Jehovah shows sincere hospitality. He cares for all without partiality.
00:00:17 He gives both rain and sun, withholding these from none;
00:00:23 He fills our hearts with food and good cheer.
00:00:29 Whenever we show favor to lowly ones, We imitate our God as beloved sons.
00:00:40 Our Father will repay the goodness we display,
00:00:46 Our kindness that is truly sincere.
00:00:54 We never know the good that may come about
00:00:59 When we see those in need and we help them out.
00:01:05 Though strangers they may be, in hospitality, We lend a hand to care for their needs.
00:01:16 Like Lydia of old, we say: ‘Be my guest.’
00:01:22 When they come to our home, they find peace and rest.
00:01:28 Our Father is aware of all those ev’rywhere,
00:01:34 Who imitate his merciful deeds.
00:01:39 Like Lydia of old, we say: ‘Be my guest.’
00:01:45 When they come to our home, they find peace and rest.
00:01:51 Our Father is aware of all those ev’rywhere,
00:01:56 Who imitate his merciful deeds.

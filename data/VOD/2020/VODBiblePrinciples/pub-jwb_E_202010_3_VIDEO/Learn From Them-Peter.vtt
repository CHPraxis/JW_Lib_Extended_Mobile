After working unassigned territory,

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:14.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made up my mind to put in my application
for regular pioneering.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, things were going
really well at work.

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this the right time
to make a drastic change?

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new foreign-language group
is being formed in our congregation.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no way I’m joining.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how difficult it is?

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe this isn’t right for me.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:09.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The culture and language are so different.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our youngest now

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his own assignment,

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe we could serve
where the need is greater,

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like we did before the kids.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But we’re not that energetic couple anymore.

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s too much.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shared my concerns about pioneering

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone who’s been doing it
for a long time.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminded me
of the apostle Peter’s example.

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a fisherman by trade,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jesus knew

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:47.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be so much more.

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter hadn’t caught anything all night,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with Jesus next to him,
things would be different.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter felt overwhelmed.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simon,

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stop being afraid.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:30.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From now on you will be catching men alive.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ministry would be his life’s work.

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter faced a situation

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar to mine in Syrian Antioch.

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, he associated freely

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Gentile Christians.

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:05.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then some from the congregation
in Jerusalem visited,

00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his fear of their opinion
closed his heart.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:26.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul to help Peter put aside

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his fear of man.

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I prayed to Jehovah
to help me open my heart wide.

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We turned to the wisdom

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of older ones,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they reminded us of Peter’s ministry.

00:05:07.703 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may have been our age when he moved

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the need was greater in Babylon.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have had concerns like ours.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could they make the trip?

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:19.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adapt to a different place?

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:26.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they trusted in Jehovah
to help them succeed.

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:45.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do the same.

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:58.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we overcome our doubts

00:06:07.804 --> 00:06:11.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and open our hearts wide, 

00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can conquer fear

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and receive Jehovah’s blessing

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the full.

Continuing our excellent program,

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will now get to enjoy our final talk.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Anthony Morris
of the Governing Body

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be giving this talk to us.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:16.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has an interesting theme also:

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A Blueprint for Spiritual Success.”

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Morris,
please give us this valuable “blueprint.”

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:33.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To introduce the information,

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:36.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I’d show you this here.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a blueprint.

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:44.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this one happens to be—

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I got it from a friend of mine.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was part of the blueprint

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for building world headquarters.

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is connected
with the Offices/Services Building,

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the blueprint.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:03.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what I did learn is that you also have,

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that business,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of them on white background now.

00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>Webster’s Dictionary</i>
did capture that fact very nicely.

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what it says

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in defining a blueprint (that word):

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:27.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a photographic print in white
on a bright blue ground

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or blue on a white ground

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:35.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“used especially for copying maps,

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mechanical drawings, and architects’ plans.”

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:43.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly thinking
of the architects’ plans,

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:47.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t help but think
about Proverbs chapter 8,

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see there Jesus being referred to

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:55.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the “master worker”
and Jehovah is really the Architect.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:57.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the Creator.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus was a spiritual success with that

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he followed
the Architect’s direction.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s something
I want you to keep in mind,

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll get to the blueprint,
as I’m calling it, in a moment.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other definition in <i>Webster’s Dictionary</i>
I thought was pertinent:

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“something resembling a blueprint

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(as in serving as a model

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:29.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or providing guidance);

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and I love the one little expression
that appeared after that]

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“especially:</i> a detailed plan

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or program of action.”

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s how I’m borrowing
that word “blueprint”

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these following thoughts

00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:49.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Peter’s second letter.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you could, we’re going to show you

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:56.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I’m referring to
as a blueprint for spiritual success.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 2 Peter chapter 1,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are nine things you’ll notice here

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going to emphasize
in verses 5 through 7.

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Peter writes:
“For this very reason,

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put forth all earnest effort

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:19.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to supply to your faith virtue,

00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:22.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your virtue knowledge,

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your knowledge self-control,

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your self-control endurance,

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:31.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your endurance godly devotion,

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your godly devotion brotherly affection,

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your brotherly affection love.”

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is the blueprint.

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:46.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are nine thoughts
that are expressed here.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, there are a lot of other things.

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:50.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us the whole Bible,

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is just a nice memory aid,
a good blueprint,

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to continue

00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as spiritual, successful people.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first one there is “earnest effort.”

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:06.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s basic.

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, obviously, (and we commend you for it)

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve shown earnest effort
just to come this far:

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be invited to Gilead
(to qualify for that),

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:20.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during your class,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and going out in the ministry on the weekends
—earnest effort. 

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have to continue that.

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not born with earnest effort.

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:31.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a decision you make.

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:33.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to make the same decision.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to put forth earnest effort.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It starts there.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No effort, no success.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each individual has to decide,

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:46.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m putting forth the earnest effort here,

00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:49.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m going to be a success.’

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you’ve got the earnest effort,

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then this is what’s involved here

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—have the effort to have faith.

00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, time does not allow us

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:04.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go into detail on each one of these,

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but faith obviously is essential.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice in Hebrews chapter 12

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(or, excuse me, 11—Hebrews chapter 11)

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the absolute necessity of faith

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a spiritual success.

00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:25.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in chapter 11, verse 1:

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:31.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of what is hoped for,
the evident demonstration

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:33.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of realities that are not seen.”

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it goes on to emphasize the need for it

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:42.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how essential it is
in verse 6 of the same chapter:

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, without faith
it is impossible

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to please God well,

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God must believe

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:54.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he is and that he becomes the rewarder

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s pretty clear.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy to misunderstand
what’s being said here.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to keep your assured expectation

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what you’ve been hoping for.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s part of being a spiritual success.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can’t weaken.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how clear does it get?

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:21.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t please God
and I can’t please God without faith.

00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s serious business.

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And none of us want to go
the remainder of the time

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not pleasing
our heavenly Father, Jehovah God.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate that.

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, right before he went into that,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the previous (what we call chapter 10),

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice verse 38 and verse 39

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of chapter 10:

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But my righteous one
will live by reason of faith,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and if he shrinks back,
I have no pleasure in him.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:58.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now we are not the sort
who shrink back to destruction,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the sort who have faith
for the preserving of our lives.”

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:04.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, as we’re applying it now,

00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:08.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be a spiritual success
and have everlasting life.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:11.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you have to have faith.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s crucial.

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next he mentions “virtue.”

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that has to do with moral excellence.

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of you have that.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are single; others of you are married.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have virtue—that moral excellence.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:34.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re morally excellent,

00:07:34.403 --> 00:07:38.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in these last days in this world,

00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:40.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
boy, do you stand out.

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:42.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does that do?

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that you’re trying to stand out,

00:07:44.147 --> 00:07:48.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but your moral excellence,
your virtuous behavior,

00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:50.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
glorifies God.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah appreciates that.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to succeed at glorifying him.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring attention to it.

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t joke about immorality.

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, I mean,
the comedians are full of it.

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:12.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re morally excellent.

00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have a thing to do

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:17.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “the spirit of the world”—with that.

00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next he mentions here

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowledge”—“knowledge.”

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, obviously you appreciate knowledge.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you had a lot of knowledge
before you got to Gilead.

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how many people,
and including in this organization,

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a few months of studying like you have?

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is incredible, isn’t it?

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:47.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it’s very hard
for you to explain to others.

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:50.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were reading the Bible
before you got here.

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:54.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t raise your hand
if you didn’t quite get there.

00:08:54.884 --> 00:08:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God forgives you.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It depends on circumstances.

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once you were here,
(and we love our instructors here

00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with theocratic schools,
the Teaching Committee)

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a whole lot more knowledge

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than you did a few months ago.

00:09:13.836 --> 00:09:16.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you agree?
It’s wonderful.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, part of you succeeding is

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:24.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be satisfied with this downpour

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all this knowledge.

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:28.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just take it as valuable.

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:31.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep going, and get some new ideas

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to research
some things, and go with it.

00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:36.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’re going to be
a spiritual success,

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve got to keep taking in the knowledge.

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:42.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very clear and very simple.

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:46.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah will bless your intake

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:48.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of knowledge.

00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:51.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no end to it.
It’s wonderful.

00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:54.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it’s just that I’m always amazed.

00:09:54.176 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always said,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The more I learn,
the more I realize how little I know.”

00:10:02.418 --> 00:10:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s not just a statement.
That’s a fact.

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And imagine, with Jehovah, it’s just—
But isn’t that great?

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:15.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will go on for eternity
—taking in knowledge.

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do it now,
you’ll be able to do it forever.

00:10:20.236 --> 00:10:23.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an honor for our heavenly Father!

00:10:23.906 --> 00:10:27.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he mentions here

00:10:27.376 --> 00:10:31.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your knowledge self-control.”

00:10:31.113 --> 00:10:34.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an aspect
of “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re well aware of.

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to have it.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:40.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to have it
if you’re going to succeed spiritually

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gain everlasting life.

00:10:42.992 --> 00:10:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need self-control.

00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you have to pray about it,
especially in these last days.

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:54.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, notice
in 1 Corinthians chapter 10,

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll come back here
to Peter right after.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here in verse 12

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 10:12:

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So let the one who thinks he is standing

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our thinking—

00:11:18.527 --> 00:11:21.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to pray for self-control with it

00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Devil and his wicked system

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as he and his demons
are always trying to affect our thinking.

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this case here,
you think you’re standing?

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Guess what?
You’re about ready to fall.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by saying,
“Jehovah, please give me self-control”

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:44.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you see when the Devil might try
some sort of temptation or whatever

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:46.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(something you face):

00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give me self-control.

00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to stand firm for you”
—now you’re OK.

00:11:53.596 --> 00:11:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holy spirit will do that.

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:59.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll have that self-control necessary

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose the Devil in his wicked effort

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:08.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it so that we don’t succeed.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just crucial.

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next he mentions with self-control

00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the blueprint goes on) “endurance.”

00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could spend considerable time

00:12:22.892 --> 00:12:26.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just talking about endurance.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:29.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s absolutely essential.

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:34.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the things you’ve endured already
in your dedicated life.

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:37.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as I told the brothers

00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Coordinators’ Committee Office,

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, when we’re facing
these disasters and all these things,

00:12:43.112 --> 00:12:45.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been telling them
for some time now:

00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:49.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cheer up! It’s going to get worse.”

00:12:49.084 --> 00:12:51.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we keep a sense of humor with it.

00:12:51.921 --> 00:12:55.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s a fact.

00:12:55.324 --> 00:13:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’re experiencing right now
in this global pandemic,

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:03.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was telling the branch class yesterday:

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:06.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Doesn’t bother me.
We’ve been waiting for this.

00:13:06.836 --> 00:13:09.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We knew things like this
were going to happen.

00:13:09.271 --> 00:13:12.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ Jesus has prepared us.

00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:14.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where’s the shock?”

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you got to think, and Jehovah directs us
with how to deal with these things,

00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:21.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we endure.

00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why Jesus—
You remember this in Matthew chapter 24,

00:13:25.488 --> 00:13:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we’ll come back here
—Matthew chapter 24.

00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve been so well-equipped.

00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:39.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all here so that we can be a success.

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13 of Matthew chapter 24:

00:13:42.771 --> 00:13:46.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the one who has endured to the end

00:13:46.842 --> 00:13:50.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[not who showed some endurance,

00:13:50.846 --> 00:13:55.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“no, the one who has endured to the end]

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:57.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be saved.”

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what we beg Jehovah: “Help us.”

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of the blueprint.

00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:05.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to endure to the end.

00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:07.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:09.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever we have to face,

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:13.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s support,
we’re going to succeed.

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now after endurance,

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he mentions “godly devotion.”

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, <i>The Watchtower </i>has commented

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this in years past.

00:14:26.315 --> 00:14:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a beautiful thing to keep in mind

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why this is so crucial to spiritual success.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:37.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s captured nicely here

00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the revised translation—godly devotion.

00:14:40.763 --> 00:14:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the thinking there and to try to convey

00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was coming across here for all of us

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:50.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is you’re devoted

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:53.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or I’m devoted to Jehovah personally

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this attachment to him personally.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:02.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So some of you are married couples.

00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:05.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you want your mate

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be attached to your God

00:15:09.258 --> 00:15:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you worship together.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what is going to make a success.

00:15:13.963 --> 00:15:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly devotion
—being personally attached to Jehovah.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It affects every aspect of our life.

00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:25.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re attached to him.
It’s personal.

00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just something special,

00:15:28.711 --> 00:15:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone should have that feeling

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of not just devotion,

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:36.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, but attachment to him.

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love him.
We’re whole-souled.

00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:40.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You get exclusive devotion.’

00:15:40.823 --> 00:15:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, just thinking about him,
and you can’t see them,

00:15:44.727 --> 00:15:48.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I got goose bumps on my back,

00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:52.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking about the love for him
—the attachment to him.

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how nice when,
if you are married, your mate has that.

00:15:57.406 --> 00:15:59.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to succeed.

00:15:59.642 --> 00:16:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Devotion to Him personally

00:16:03.412 --> 00:16:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all that he has shown and will show

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s just very personal.

00:16:10.352 --> 00:16:12.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:16.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he attaches after godly devotion,

00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:20.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brotherly affection”

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:23.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“brotherly affection.”

00:16:23.732 --> 00:16:27.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you think about that now—

00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:30.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciated Brother Noumair’s comments.

00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:34.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw this yesterday while with you
for a couple of lectures

00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:39.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then saw some of you
after your last class,

00:16:39.114 --> 00:16:43.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Noumair mentioned
how you enjoy each other’s company.

00:16:43.952 --> 00:16:48.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what he was describing
was your brotherly affection for each other.

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s real; it’s genuine.

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have that brotherly affection.

00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That should be true in all the congregations.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve displayed it.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to succeed,
you’ve got to continue to do that.

00:17:01.704 --> 00:17:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s something
for you to think about, though,

00:17:04.306 --> 00:17:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because commendably
you’ve done well with that.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:09.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you
are going to take it back with you

00:17:09.578 --> 00:17:13.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this need for godly devotion.

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:16.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to do that.
I’m counting on it.

00:17:16.685 --> 00:17:18.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, here’s a thought for you

00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1 Thessalonians chapter 4

00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:26.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Thessalonians

00:17:26.562 --> 00:17:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 4.

00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:32.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just something to consider

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:35.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you soon-to-be graduates),

00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:39.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take it with you to your assignments.

00:17:39.742 --> 00:17:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Thessalonians 4:9

00:17:43.412 --> 00:17:47.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then here in the 10th verse as well:

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:52.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, concerning brotherly love,

00:17:52.254 --> 00:17:55.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you do not need us to write to you,

00:17:55.557 --> 00:18:00.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you yourselves
are taught by God to love one another.

00:18:00.562 --> 00:18:04.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, you are doing so

00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia.

00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now notice this.
This is a thought-provoking point.]

00:18:11.807 --> 00:18:15.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But we urge you, brothers,

00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go on doing so in fuller measure.”

00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:23.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:18:23.051 --> 00:18:25.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that applies to you too.

00:18:25.954 --> 00:18:28.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve shown it during your class.

00:18:28.157 --> 00:18:30.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I want you to think about it
from time to time

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:33.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you’re a spiritual success.

00:18:33.796 --> 00:18:37.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got to ask yourself,
individually particularly,

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:40.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe as a couple if you wish,

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you doing it in fuller measure?

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:49.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a lot to think about,
seeing as things get more and more critical.

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good point.

00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:55.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need this godly expression here

00:18:55.684 --> 00:18:57.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brotherly affection.

00:18:57.686 --> 00:18:59.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our brothers.

00:18:59.955 --> 00:19:03.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We forgive each other, but we have this.

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:08.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s got to get fuller,
and we know you’re going to do that.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll think about it.

00:19:10.098 --> 00:19:13.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just examine yourself
from time to time with this blueprint.

00:19:13.468 --> 00:19:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you showing brotherly affection
in fuller measure?

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:20.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you might get back—
I know we’re all different.

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:23.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know your circumstances,

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:25.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obviously God does and Christ Jesus does,

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:29.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some might say:

00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:33.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Boy, she’s just filled
with brotherly affection.

00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:36.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’s amazing.

00:19:36.191 --> 00:19:38.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t remember that about her

00:19:38.527 --> 00:19:41.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before (or him).’

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now sisters, I don’t want you
to feel like I’m picking on you.

00:19:45.567 --> 00:19:47.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same applies to the brothers.

00:19:47.903 --> 00:19:52.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But show love and brotherly affection
in fuller measure.

00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:54.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something
to think about from time to time.

00:19:54.743 --> 00:19:56.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now back here

00:19:56.745 --> 00:20:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Peter’s second letter,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is the last thought

00:20:04.253 --> 00:20:08.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he puts into the blueprint:

00:20:08.757 --> 00:20:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your godly devotion brotherly affection,”

00:20:11.827 --> 00:20:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then notice,
“to your brotherly affection love.”

00:20:15.197 --> 00:20:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that has reference to <i>a·gaʹpe</i>.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brotherly affection

00:20:20.068 --> 00:20:24.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a unique expression of brothers
—that love for them.

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:28.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is a principled love, as you know.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s governed by principle.

00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:34.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the kind of love
we need to keep on preaching

00:20:34.783 --> 00:20:38.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because people
are going to get more and more

00:20:38.787 --> 00:20:41.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distinct with their contempt for us.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s growing in most countries.

00:20:44.793 --> 00:20:48.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe</i> is going to move us
to keep on going.

00:20:48.363 --> 00:20:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how they mistreat us
and what they say or do,

00:20:53.068 --> 00:20:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to show love
until Jehovah says:

00:20:56.405 --> 00:20:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s it. No more preaching.”

00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:03.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about our time right now
because of this threat.

00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:06.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are these national security problems
in different countries.

00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:10.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Metropolitan preaching
in many countries is not happening.

00:21:13.956 --> 00:21:16.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Door-to-door preaching is a problem.

00:21:16.725 --> 00:21:19.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Memorial campaign is—

00:21:19.227 --> 00:21:21.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different things are going on.

00:21:21.496 --> 00:21:25.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given his spirit
to the Governing Body

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to do the right thing

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to respect Caesar and obey Him as our ruler.

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:33.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes you think:

00:21:33.241 --> 00:21:37.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What are the inactive
or others that have known about the truth—?

00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they thinking?’

00:21:38.981 --> 00:21:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we hope the best for them.

00:21:41.283 --> 00:21:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you better move.
This is serious business.”

00:21:46.288 --> 00:21:51.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe</i> love is going to help us
to try to reach out to them.

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:55.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is the time for action
because the day is coming.

00:21:55.797 --> 00:21:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it; it’s over.

00:21:59.334 --> 00:22:02.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once that great tribulation
breaks out, that’s it.

00:22:02.804 --> 00:22:06.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t help.
It’s over for them.

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:10.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those are the nine parts

00:22:10.612 --> 00:22:13.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the blueprint for spiritual success.

00:22:13.782 --> 00:22:17.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the thought here

00:22:17.185 --> 00:22:19.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that’s what we want to conclude with)

00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:21.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 8:

00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:23.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if these things exist in you

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice] and overflow,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will prevent you
from being either inactive

00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:34.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or unfruitful
regarding the accurate knowledge

00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:36.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:38.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there it is.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re just exhorting
you precious ones soon to graduate:

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:47.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let it just exist (the blueprint).

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:50.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let all of this overflow,

00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you are guaranteed to be
a spiritual success.

00:23:05.367 --> 00:23:08.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we appreciate that very much,
Brother Morris.

00:23:08.937 --> 00:23:11.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that blueprint

00:23:11.273 --> 00:23:16.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that guarantees success
in building spirituality

00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ourselves and others.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you probably have noticed

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have some envelopes
here on our table.

00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:29.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these are not ordinary envelopes.

00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:34.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re special envelopes
containing some special items.

00:23:34.229 --> 00:23:38.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in these envelopes are your diplomas.

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:41.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a class picture in the envelopes.

00:23:41.903 --> 00:23:44.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a letter from the Teaching Committee.

00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:48.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of the envelopes
contain additional letters

00:23:48.243 --> 00:23:51.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding world headquarters assignments.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s a note indicating

00:23:53.882 --> 00:23:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will receive a modest monetary gift

00:23:57.385 --> 00:24:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deposited into your account on Monday.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:05.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So some good things are in these envelopes.

00:24:05.393 --> 00:24:07.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re confident that all of you

00:24:07.462 --> 00:24:10.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will appreciate receiving
these special envelopes.

00:24:10.465 --> 00:24:14.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one by one and couple by couple,

00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:18.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to have you
come up and receive your envelopes.

00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:21.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother David Schafer,

00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:24.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,
is going to help me here.

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:26.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s got the hard job.

00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:29.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has to pronounce all of these names,

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:31.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the pressure is on him.

00:24:31.953 --> 00:24:36.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The parents and relatives are listening,
and they’ll know if he did it right.

00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:41.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all I have to do
is hand the envelopes to them

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give them an elbow bump.

00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:24.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we were really getting into
that elbow bump, weren’t we?

00:30:26.107 --> 00:30:30.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although, that will wear you down
after all of those bumps.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we try to follow the good example

00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:39.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re recommending
at the Health Department.

00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:41.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re so happy

to have been able to give
those special envelopes

00:30:44.158 --> 00:30:46.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all these dear ones.

00:30:46.194 --> 00:30:49.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body
is very happy to give them.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:53.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that you all
are very happy to have received them

00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:57.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have reached this spiritual milestone

00:30:57.405 --> 00:30:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your theocratic career.

00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:04.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, now we’re not going
to call you Gilead students.

00:31:04.012 --> 00:31:05.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re no longer students.

00:31:05.313 --> 00:31:08.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to call you Gilead graduates

00:31:08.483 --> 00:31:11.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you now have your diplomas.

00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:15.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s raise
our curtain and get a look

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the entire 148th class

00:31:18.927 --> 00:31:22.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:31:44.686 --> 00:31:47.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a nice applause
you gave to yourselves.

00:31:49.524 --> 00:31:51.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got to tease them a little bit.

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:54.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a nice-looking group

00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:58.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those smiling faces, a handsome group!

00:31:58.066 --> 00:32:00.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you look very closely,

00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:04.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they look quite a bit smarter
than they did five months ago.

00:32:04.072 --> 00:32:07.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve learned a lot during this time.

00:32:07.308 --> 00:32:10.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But while you’re looking
at this beautiful group,

00:32:10.311 --> 00:32:15.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
permit me, please, to give a few statistics
to give you an overview.

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:17.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, so that you don’t try to quickly count,

00:32:17.485 --> 00:32:20.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have 55 students,

00:32:20.521 --> 00:32:25.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 55 graduates (I can’t say that anymore),

00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:30.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
55 graduates of this 148th class of Gilead,

00:32:30.531 --> 00:32:33.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that includes 20 couples,

00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:38.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
11 single brothers, and 4 single sisters.

00:32:38.573 --> 00:32:42.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The average age is 40.1.

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that sounds young to me.

00:32:44.278 --> 00:32:47.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how everything changes.

00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:51.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the youngest is 30.7;

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:54.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the oldest, 56.1;

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:58.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the average years baptized, 24.6;

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the average years in full-time service, 17.9;

00:33:03.031 --> 00:33:06.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the average years
in special full-time service, 13.1.

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And listen to this:
The languages spoken

00:33:09.937 --> 00:33:13.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by this class is 35.

00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:17.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a multilingual class for sure.

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:20.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes us think of the great crowd

00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:22.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they
would be taken from ‘all nations,

00:33:22.717 --> 00:33:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tribes, peoples, and tongues’

00:33:27.055 --> 00:33:30.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—35 languages represented here.

00:33:30.291 --> 00:33:35.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though they’re relatively young
(as we said, the average is 40),

00:33:35.063 --> 00:33:39.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re quite experienced because on average

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have spent 73 percent of the time

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:46.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since they’ve been baptized
in the full-time service.

00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:51.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just about three quarters of the time
since they’ve been baptized

00:33:51.012 --> 00:33:53.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve been in the full-time service.

00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’re going to have
our class letter read

00:33:57.351 --> 00:34:01.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 by Brother Mussa Mwasile,

00:34:01.823 --> 00:34:06.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can see now why I had
Brother Schafer pronounce all of the names.

00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:09.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is Brother Mussa Mwasile,

00:34:09.897 --> 00:34:12.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s going back to Kenya.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s going to read
the letter from the class.

00:34:25.012 --> 00:34:29.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the Governing Body

00:38:29.357 --> 00:38:32.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Brother Mwasile,

00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:34.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I forgot to give you your elbow bump.

00:38:34.862 --> 00:38:36.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry about that.

00:38:36.964 --> 00:38:40.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I took the letter, and I’ll make sure

00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:42.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
gets this beautiful letter.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful letter!

00:38:43.938 --> 00:38:46.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It nicely expresses your feelings

00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:49.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about being at Gilead,

00:38:49.377 --> 00:38:51.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you say that you enjoyed being here.

00:38:51.612 --> 00:38:55.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we say that we enjoyed having you.

00:38:55.282 --> 00:38:58.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was truly a mutual

00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:03.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“interchange of encouragement”
as mentioned at Romans 1:12.

00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:08.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Mussa did a beautiful job.

00:39:08.129 --> 00:39:12.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was actually his first
speaking assignment as a Gilead graduate.

00:39:12.233 --> 00:39:14.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he really did a good job, didn’t he?

00:39:14.668 --> 00:39:15.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really good.

00:39:15.903 --> 00:39:19.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to do wonderful things
in the future with Jehovah’s help,

00:39:19.507 --> 00:39:21.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like all of you.

00:39:21.509 --> 00:39:24.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’ve really had a good time having you.

00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:29.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now I get to talk five more minutes
to you one more time here.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you recall

00:39:32.386 --> 00:39:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the opening discussion of our program,

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we talked about four areas

00:39:38.726 --> 00:39:42.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can imitate Jesus’ modesty.

00:39:42.196 --> 00:39:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, briefly, let’s talk about
one more aspect of modesty

00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is closely related

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:53.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being aware of our own limitations

00:39:53.607 --> 00:39:57.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is being aware
of the limitations of others.

00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:01.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, our role model, Jesus,
set a perfect example

00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:04.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this aspect of modesty.

00:40:04.285 --> 00:40:06.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ponder for a moment, if you will,

00:40:06.787 --> 00:40:10.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is stated at Matthew 3:16.

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It talks about how after Jesus was baptized,

00:40:14.595 --> 00:40:18.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he came up out of the water,
and then it says:

00:40:18.232 --> 00:40:21.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heavens were opened up.”

00:40:21.535 --> 00:40:23.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:40:23.537 --> 00:40:26.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the <i>Greatest Man</i> book
makes this comment:

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Evidently it means

00:40:28.776 --> 00:40:31.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that while he is being baptized,

00:40:31.745 --> 00:40:35.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the memory of his prehuman life in heaven

00:40:35.249 --> 00:40:37.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“returns to him.

00:40:37.485 --> 00:40:40.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thus, Jesus now fully recalls

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:44.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“his life as a spirit son of Jehovah God,

00:40:44.391 --> 00:40:49.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“including all the things
that God spoke to him in heaven

00:40:49.263 --> 00:40:53.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during his prehuman existence.”

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an amazing comment, isn’t it?

00:40:55.035 --> 00:40:57.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you just imagine

00:40:57.037 --> 00:41:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flooding into the perfect
human brain of Jesus

00:41:01.108 --> 00:41:05.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the memory of billions of years

00:41:05.412 --> 00:41:07.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of prehuman existence

00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:10.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—aeons and aeons of time

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and countless,
countless experiences

00:41:12.987 --> 00:41:17.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he served 
as “a master worker” beside Jehovah,

00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:21.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he served
as “the prince of Jehovah’s army,”

00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:24.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he served as Jehovah’s Spokesman,

00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:27.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he served as Michael the archangel?

00:41:27.201 --> 00:41:29.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you think about it,

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would’ve been
the greatest download of information

00:41:33.941 --> 00:41:36.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had ever happened.

00:41:36.977 --> 00:41:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s the point:

00:41:39.513 --> 00:41:44.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, you received
a download here at Gilead, right?

00:41:44.485 --> 00:41:47.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing like what Jesus got,

00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:50.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you had a tremendous
five-month download, didn’t you?

00:41:50.558 --> 00:41:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is, How did Jesus use

00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:57.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of this newly acquired, voluminous,

00:41:57.298 --> 00:42:01.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tremendous knowledge that he received?

00:42:01.702 --> 00:42:05.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he use it
in his dealings with others?

00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he never overwhelmed them

00:42:07.808 --> 00:42:10.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with impressive displays of knowledge.

00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:12.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he could’ve done that, couldn’t he?

00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:14.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never did that.

00:42:14.281 --> 00:42:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always very aware of their limitations

00:42:19.053 --> 00:42:21.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very considerate, very thoughtful.

00:42:21.088 --> 00:42:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what he said to his disciples

00:42:23.724 --> 00:42:26.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 16:12?

00:42:26.994 --> 00:42:29.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to them:

00:42:29.029 --> 00:42:32.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I still have many things to say to you,

00:42:32.499 --> 00:42:36.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you are not able to bear them now.”

00:42:36.937 --> 00:42:39.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he was very thoughtful
—wasn’t he?—of their limitations,

00:42:39.573 --> 00:42:42.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he had
all this tremendous knowledge.

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what a good example for us!

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, even though he was perfect,

00:42:49.717 --> 00:42:52.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was not a perfectionist.

00:42:52.152 --> 00:42:55.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, he didn’t require
perfection of others.

00:42:55.456 --> 00:42:58.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allowed for the mistakes,
the shortcomings,

00:42:58.892 --> 00:43:01.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the weaknesses, of others.

00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:05.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about this,
there were many other ways he was sensitive

00:43:05.532 --> 00:43:09.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he was compassionate—
regarding the limitations of others.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one more example:

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:14.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew his disciples at times

00:43:14.108 --> 00:43:17.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needed to get away from the crowds and rest.

00:43:17.945 --> 00:43:22.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can you dear Gilead graduates

00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:25.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imitate Jesus’ modesty

00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:28.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being aware of the limitations of others?

00:43:28.055 --> 00:43:31.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we mentioned, you had a tremendous
five-month download of information,

00:43:31.825 --> 00:43:36.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but please use it modestly.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:40.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use it in a way that you never put more

00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:42.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on others than they can bear.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use it in a way
that you realize their limitations.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone has limitations
—some more than others—

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but be aware of that.

00:43:52.479 --> 00:43:57.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little by little, share the good things
you’ve learned with these ones.

00:43:57.518 --> 00:44:01.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And always be aware

00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never put more on them than they can bear.

00:44:04.692 --> 00:44:08.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a saying,
“By the mile it’s a trial;

00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:10.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the yard it’s hard;

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inch by inch it’s a cinch.”

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just little by little,

00:44:15.502 --> 00:44:19.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share and help the ones in your territory,

00:44:19.506 --> 00:44:21.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your congregation, your Bethel family.

00:44:21.542 --> 00:44:25.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help them to benefit from the good things
you’ve learned these last five months.

00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:27.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please, by all means,

00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allow for the imperfections
and shortcomings of others.

00:44:32.386 --> 00:44:36.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the perfect One was not a perfectionist,

00:44:36.423 --> 00:44:39.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then even more so we as all imperfect ones,

00:44:39.927 --> 00:44:43.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely, we can allow
for the imperfections of others.

00:44:43.964 --> 00:44:46.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know you’re
going to be determined to do that.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please be sensitive and compassionate

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:53.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning the physical, 
emotional limitations

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of others as Jesus was.

00:44:57.244 --> 00:45:00.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, we’ve discussed all together

00:45:00.681 --> 00:45:04.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five areas in which
we can imitate Jesus’ modesty.

00:45:04.385 --> 00:45:06.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In quick review,

00:45:06.387 --> 00:45:09.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we talked about the need to always remember

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:12.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that (1) we have authority limitations

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try hard to stay within the bounds,

00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:21.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we have to remember
our lesser importance

00:45:21.502 --> 00:45:26.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to Jehovah’s
vastly greater importance,

00:45:26.507 --> 00:45:30.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) we have to remember
there are some things

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re simply not entitled to know,

00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:35.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least not now,
and then some things maybe never,

(4) we want to be aware

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of always fully relying
on Jehovah

00:45:43.524 --> 00:45:46.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never ourselves,

00:45:46.427 --> 00:45:48.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (5) as we just discussed,

00:45:48.962 --> 00:45:52.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always be aware of the limitations of others.

00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:56.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we imitate Jesus’ modesty
in these five areas,

00:45:56.236 --> 00:45:59.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will love us dearly

00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:04.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he dearly loves his modest Son.

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll love us the same way.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wherever we go,
whatever privileges we have,

00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:14.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will always be refreshing to others

00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:17.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus was.

00:46:33.307 --> 00:46:36.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, in imitation
of what is done

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on JW Broadcasting®,

00:46:40.781 --> 00:46:43.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have a postcard at the end, don’t they?

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re going to have a postcard

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming from the class,

00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:51.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 148th class of Gilead.

00:46:51.024 --> 00:46:52.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Send them a postcard.

00:46:52.993 --> 00:46:55.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Send them, please, your love and affection.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They send you warm love and affection

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:04.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the 148th class of Gilead.

00:47:04.872 --> 00:47:09.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s a lot of love that they sent,
and we finish by saying,

00:47:09.776 --> 00:47:12.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From the 148th class

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of Gilead in the Patterson auditorium,

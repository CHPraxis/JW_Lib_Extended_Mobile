And now from Andrew to John

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:07.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the apostle John;

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was living at a most critical time

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:13.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the last surviving apostle.

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:17.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was helping to hold back
a tidal wave of worldly influence

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apostate thinking
that was already eroding 

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christian congregation.

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:26.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under divine inspiration,

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John wrote
a most vigorous letter to his brothers.

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:34.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can still sense in him
that fiery enthusiasm

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that earned him his name,
“Son of Thunder.”

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that letter, the letter
that we’re going to look at right now,

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show you

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you like John can thunder for Jehovah.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can you do that?
Let’s find out.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to open up now
to 1 John chapter 1.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 1 and 3,

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch how John makes very clear
his objective right from the outset.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 1:1:

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:11.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That which was from the beginning,

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now, the beginning was Christ Jesus
in his prehuman existence;

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was the firstborn of all creation]

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:21.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which we have heard,

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:25.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which we have seen with our eyes,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we have observed
and our hands have felt [him].”

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:33.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice that John right away wants to grab
the attention of the brothers

00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:36.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to say: ‘Look! We heard him.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We’ve seen him with our eyes.
We’ve observed him.

00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve felt him. I touched him.

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I laid my head in his chest.’

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did John even hear his heartbeat?

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:52.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the fact is
that these messages were so clear to John,

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted to make it known.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 3:

00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That which we have seen and heard,”
again John repeats this.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘His teachings, I saw them—I heard them.

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:07.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so convinced that God’s powers
are operating through him,’

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there in verse 3, John says:

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are reporting also to you.”

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m reporting this to you,’ John said.

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:20.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John had such good reason to thunder.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a living link to Christ.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers alive at that time
did not have the privilege that John had

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:31.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk and to touch
and to be taught by Jesus personally.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But John did,
and he was so moved by these experiences

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:40.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he wanted to report
these real-life experiences about Christ.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To protect his brothers

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to protect his beloved brothers
from the false teachers at that time

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were trying to draw them
away from the truth.

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:55.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, John spoke up against lies

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostates
and the other false teachers

00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:01.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were spreading in his day.

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:06.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were telling disgusting lies
about God and Jesus.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They craftily constructed speeches
designed to corrupt the teachings of Christ.

00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John knew that.
He felt it.

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:17.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even claimed to have
secret revelations and superior knowledge.

00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they boasted that they were
the correctors of the apostles.

00:03:21.484 --> 00:03:23.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Liars!

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And John could not stomach liars.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is of interest:

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out of the 15 times
the Bible used the word “liar,”

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he used the word eight times.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, John continued to thunder, defend,
and speak out for the truth

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he loved the truth,
he loved Christ Jesus,

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:49.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he loved the Father, Jehovah.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly today,

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:58.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lies and false reports
against the truth abound.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And enemies of the truth use any means

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:05.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to smear
the reputation of Christ’s brothers.

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, what’s the point?

00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:10.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your time here at world headquarters,

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your time with the Governing Body,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your time with the responsible brothers
from world headquarters

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:20.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
convinces you firsthand

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that any negative reports that you hear
about the organization are lies.

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:28.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you can thunder for Jehovah

00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by defending the truth
about those whom Christ appointed

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take the lead in his organization.

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:36.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look what you’ve been able to do.

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can say just like John:

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Look, I’ve heard. I’ve seen.

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:41.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve observed. I’ve felt.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is me.
I’ve had a close-up view.’

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:49.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an even closer look
than you can have on JW Broadcasting.

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:53.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one-on-one in the flesh.

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can say:

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve had a close-up view
of God’s spirit-directed organization.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And now I am reporting to you,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my beloved brothers and sisters,’
in the assignments that you have.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what you can do now
—‘what I’ve seen and I’ve heard.’

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:15.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in this way,
imagine what you can do

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:20.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen, stabilize,
and build confidence in your brothers!

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is your responsibility now.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This wasn’t coming here to school
just to have a good time.

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:28.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you did have a good time,
but that wasn’t the objective.

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The objective is now that you go out
and you serve your brothers

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you, each and every one of you,
brother, sister,

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
single, married; it doesn’t matter.

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:42.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your brothers and sisters now deserve
a Gilead graduate’s reward.

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going to give it to them.

00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you thunder in doing that.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s go back to the apostle John.

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:58.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John’s thunder never diminished
to a low rumble.

00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:02.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did John do
when he was released from prison

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the island of Patmos
at nearly 100 years old?

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:08.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do?

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, did he say:
‘I’m a weak, old man.

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing I can do anymore’?

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:13.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no, no.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he knew the apostasy was coming

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that oppressive wolves
were already misleading the brothers.

00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:24.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But John said, ‘Not on my watch.’

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he would continue to thunder for Jehovah

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:32.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using every fiber of his being

00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:36.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help his brothers
right down to his dying breath.

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do that?

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote four Bible books,

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:46.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the portion that we just read here

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1 John chapter 1.

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t retire.

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was still full of fiery enthusiasm,

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanting to help his brothers
because he loved the truth.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped John
to keep the thunder rolling?

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped him?

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:08.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew the final outcome.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in 96 C.E.
before his release,

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:19.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he received that unexpected flash of light
—the Revelation,

00:07:19.922 --> 00:07:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vision

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:25.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 144,000 Kingdom conquerors

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:28.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will rule with Jesus in heaven.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:30.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got that.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he was told 
about an integrity-keeping “great crowd

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . out of all [the] nations”
that would worship God in truth.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got that.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine
how that strengthened his conviction?

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:44.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of the apostasy,

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:48.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said true worship
would not be extinguished.

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So think about it.

00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:57.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a prophetic vision of the great crowd

00:07:57.326 --> 00:08:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraged John to continue
to fight and defend the truth,

00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about you

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you who see not a vision
but the reality of its fulfillment?

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, John is seeing the reality from heaven
—true—

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have a front-row seat
right here on earth

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you witness the greatest preaching effort
in history

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you watch Jehovah perform
a modern-day miracle

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by gathering
‘a great crowd from all the nations.’

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what we face now

00:08:31.394 --> 00:08:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the future,

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:36.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep the thunder rolling.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:42.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you know the final outcome.

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see it already developing.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:51.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John continued to thunder for Jehovah,

00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:56.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he mellowed
through the years of faithful service.

00:08:56.018 --> 00:09:01.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His fiery enthusiasm is now on display
in perfect balance.

00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:07.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man who once wanted
to call down fire from heaven to get results

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now uses a force much stronger

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more effective.

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:14.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:09:14.737 --> 00:09:16.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love.

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, at 1 John 2:14,

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what he says here.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just sense the love that he has

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:28.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he writes verse 14:

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I write you, fathers,

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you have come to know him
who is from the beginning.

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:40.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I write you, young men,
because you are strong

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the word of God remains in you

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have conquered the wicked one.”

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you sense the love?

00:09:48.137 --> 00:09:52.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John is saying,
‘Look, the word of God remains in you.’

00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:55.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the powerful force of love
to commend his readers

00:09:55.845 --> 00:10:00.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they never lost
their heartfelt appreciation for the truth.

00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:03.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see yourself doing that?

00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, thunder without love is just noise.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But be determined
to lovingly commend your brothers

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:12.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their endurance.

00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank them for their integrity.

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Commend them for their unselfish love.

00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Touch their hearts when you speak with them.

00:10:21.604 --> 00:10:25.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers need encouragement,
not criticism.

00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as I look at each one of you,

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a lot of thoughts
going through my mind.

00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:37.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.
I mean, here you are—

00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, all the memories

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are flooding through my mind,
flooding through my heart.

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:46.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing as I look at you!

00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:49.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still hear your comments.

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what else I can hear?

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can hear each day (when you came to class)

00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:55.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you thundered into that classroom.

00:10:55.971 --> 00:11:00.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did.
We have never seen such a thunderous class.

00:11:00.976 --> 00:11:04.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There you were each morning
hugging each other,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clapping for the morning worship comments,
commending each other.

00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:09.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if you hadn’t seen each other
in three months;

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was just last night you saw each other.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, oh no,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you thundered in appreciation
for divine truth

00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:20.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the privilege to be here at school

00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:24.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for each other’s
integrity-keeping course.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:29.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you leave,
what do we want you to remember?

00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:32.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to remember
how you can keep the thunder rolling.

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:34.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you do that?

00:11:34.877 --> 00:11:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to give you three ways.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, defend the truth.

00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:46.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow false reports and lies
about the organization that you love

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the organization that you love and cherish,

00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the very organization
that brought you to these seats.

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:56.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never allow lies and false reports
to stop you

00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from reporting
what you have seen and heard firsthand.

00:12:01.504 --> 00:12:04.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two, remember the final outcome.

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:07.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True worship will prevail.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You already see it doing so.

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And three, use the powerful force of love.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use love to commend
and fortify your brothers.

00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:20.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encourage them.
Build them up.

00:12:20.356 --> 00:12:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use love.

00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:24.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like John, with all your might,

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all your ability,

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:29.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thunder for Jehovah.

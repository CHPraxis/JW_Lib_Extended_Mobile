00:00:02.152 --> 00:00:06.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To introduce the information,

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I’d show you this here.

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:12.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a blueprint.

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this one happens to be—

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I got it from a friend of mine.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was part of the blueprint

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for building world headquarters.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is connected
with the Offices/Services Building,

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the blueprint.

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:36.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what I did learn is that you also have,

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:40.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that business,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of them on white background now.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:49.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>Webster’s Dictionary</i>
did capture that fact very nicely.

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:52.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what it says

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in defining a blueprint (that word):

00:00:55.238 --> 00:01:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a photographic print in white
on a bright blue ground

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or blue on a white ground

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“used especially for copying maps,

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mechanical drawings, and architects’ plans.”

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:16.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly thinking
of the architects’ plans,

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t help but think
about Proverbs chapter 8,

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:23.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see there Jesus being referred to

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:28.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the “master worker”
and Jehovah is really the Architect.

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:30.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the Creator.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus was a spiritual success with that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he followed
the Architect’s direction.

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s something
I want you to keep in mind,

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll get to the blueprint,
as I’m calling it, in a moment.

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other definition in <i>Webster’s Dictionary</i>
I thought was pertinent:

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:56.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“something resembling a blueprint

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(as in serving as a model

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or providing guidance);

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and I love the one little expression
that appeared after that]

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“especially:</i> a detailed plan

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or program of action.”

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s how I’m borrowing
that word “blueprint”

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these following thoughts

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Peter’s second letter.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you could, we’re going to show you

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:29.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I’m referring to
as a blueprint for spiritual success.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 2 Peter chapter 1,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are nine things you’ll notice here

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going to emphasize
in verses 5 through 7.

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Peter writes:
“For this very reason,

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put forth all earnest effort

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to supply to your faith virtue,

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:55.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your virtue knowledge,

00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your knowledge self-control,

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your self-control endurance,

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your endurance godly devotion,

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:09.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your godly devotion brotherly affection,

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your brotherly affection love.”

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is the blueprint.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:19.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are nine thoughts
that are expressed here.

00:03:19.682 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, there are a lot of other things.

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:23.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us the whole Bible,

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:28.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is just a nice memory aid,
a good blueprint,

00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:30.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to continue

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as spiritual, successful people.

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:37.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first one there is “earnest effort.”

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s basic.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, obviously, (and we commend you for it)

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve shown earnest effort
just to come this far:

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be invited to Gilead
(to qualify for that),

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during your class,

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and going out in the ministry on the weekends
—earnest effort. 

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have to continue that.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not born with earnest effort.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a decision you make.

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to make the same decision.

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:10.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to put forth earnest effort.

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It starts there.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No effort, no success.

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:17.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each individual has to decide,

00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:19.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m putting forth the earnest effort here,

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:22.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m going to be a success.’

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:25.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you’ve got the earnest effort,

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then this is what’s involved here

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:31.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—have the effort to have faith.

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, time does not allow us

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go into detail on each one of these,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but faith obviously is essential.

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice in Hebrews chapter 12

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(or, excuse me, 11—Hebrews chapter 11)

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the absolute necessity of faith

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:54.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a spiritual success.

00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in chapter 11, verse 1:

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:00.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of what is hoped for,
the evident demonstration

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of realities that are not seen.”

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:10.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it goes on to emphasize the need for it

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:15.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how essential it is
in verse 6 of the same chapter:

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, without faith
it is impossible

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to please God well,

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God must believe

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he is and that he becomes the rewarder

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s pretty clear.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:37.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy to misunderstand
what’s being said here.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to keep your assured expectation

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what you’ve been hoping for.

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s part of being a spiritual success.

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can’t weaken.

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:51.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how clear does it get?

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t please God
and I can’t please God without faith.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s serious business.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And none of us want to go
the remainder of the time

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not pleasing
our heavenly Father, Jehovah God.

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate that.

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, right before he went into that,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the previous (what we call chapter 10),

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice verse 38 and verse 39

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:17.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of chapter 10:

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But my righteous one
will live by reason of faith,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and if he shrinks back,
I have no pleasure in him.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now we are not the sort
who shrink back to destruction,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the sort who have faith
for the preserving of our lives.”

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, as we’re applying it now,

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be a spiritual success
and have everlasting life.

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:44.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you have to have faith.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s crucial.

00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next he mentions “virtue.”

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:55.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that has to do with moral excellence.

00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:58.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of you have that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are single; others of you are married.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have virtue—that moral excellence.

00:07:04.807 --> 00:07:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re morally excellent,

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in these last days in this world,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
boy, do you stand out.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does that do?

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:17.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that you’re trying to stand out,

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:21.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but your moral excellence,
your virtuous behavior,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
glorifies God.

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:25.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah appreciates that.

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:29.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to succeed at glorifying him.

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:32.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring attention to it.

00:07:32.068 --> 00:07:37.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t joke about immorality.

00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, I mean,
the comedians are full of it.

00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:45.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re morally excellent.

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have a thing to do

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:50.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “the spirit of the world”—with that.

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next he mentions here

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:58.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowledge”—“knowledge.”

00:07:58.094 --> 00:08:02.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, obviously you appreciate knowledge.

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you had a lot of knowledge
before you got to Gilead.

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how many people,
and including in this organization,

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:14.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a few months of studying like you have?

00:08:14.644 --> 00:08:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is incredible, isn’t it?

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:20.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it’s very hard
for you to explain to others.

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:23.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were reading the Bible
before you got here.

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:27.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t raise your hand
if you didn’t quite get there.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God forgives you.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:33.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It depends on circumstances.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once you were here,
(and we love our instructors here

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with theocratic schools,
the Teaching Committee)

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a whole lot more knowledge

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than you did a few months ago.

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:50.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you agree?
It’s wonderful.

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, part of you succeeding is

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be satisfied with this downpour

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all this knowledge.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just take it as valuable.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep going, and get some new ideas

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to research
some things, and go with it.

00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’re going to be
a spiritual success,

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:12.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve got to keep taking in the knowledge.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very clear and very simple.

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah will bless your intake

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of knowledge.

00:09:21.577 --> 00:09:24.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no end to it.
It’s wonderful.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it’s just that I’m always amazed.

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:30.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always said,

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The more I learn,
the more I realize how little I know.”

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:39.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s not just a statement.
That’s a fact.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And imagine, with Jehovah, it’s just—
But isn’t that great?

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:48.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will go on for eternity
—taking in knowledge.

00:09:48.971 --> 00:09:53.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do it now,
you’ll be able to do it forever.

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an honor for our heavenly Father!

00:09:56.946 --> 00:10:00.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he mentions here

00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your knowledge self-control.”

00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an aspect
of “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re well aware of.

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to have it.

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:14.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to have it
if you’re going to succeed spiritually

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gain everlasting life.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need self-control.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you have to pray about it,
especially in these last days.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, notice
in 1 Corinthians chapter 10,

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:31.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll come back here
to Peter right after.

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:36.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here in verse 12

00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 10:12:

00:10:39.989 --> 00:10:43.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So let the one who thinks he is standing

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:48.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our thinking—

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to pray for self-control with it

00:10:54.203 --> 00:10:57.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Devil and his wicked system

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:01.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as he and his demons
are always trying to affect our thinking.

00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this case here,
you think you’re standing?

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:08.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Guess what?
You’re about ready to fall.

00:11:08.984 --> 00:11:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by saying,
“Jehovah, please give me self-control”

00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:17.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you see when the Devil might try
some sort of temptation or whatever

00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:19.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(something you face):

00:11:19.528 --> 00:11:22.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give me self-control.

00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:26.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to stand firm for you”
—now you’re OK.

00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holy spirit will do that.

00:11:28.971 --> 00:11:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll have that self-control necessary

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose the Devil in his wicked effort

00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it so that we don’t succeed.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just crucial.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:47.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next he mentions with self-control

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:51.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the blueprint goes on) “endurance.”

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could spend considerable time

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:59.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just talking about endurance.

00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:02.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s absolutely essential.

00:12:02.938 --> 00:12:07.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the things you’ve endured already
in your dedicated life.

00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:10.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as I told the brothers

00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:13.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Coordinators’ Committee Office,

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, when we’re facing
these disasters and all these things,

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been telling them
for some time now:

00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:22.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cheer up! It’s going to get worse.”

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:24.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we keep a sense of humor with it.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s a fact.

00:12:28.364 --> 00:12:33.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’re experiencing right now
in this global pandemic,

00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was telling the branch class yesterday:

00:12:36.272 --> 00:12:39.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Doesn’t bother me.
We’ve been waiting for this.

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We knew things like this
were going to happen.

00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ Jesus has prepared us.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where’s the shock?”

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you got to think, and Jehovah directs us
with how to deal with these things,

00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we endure.

00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:58.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why Jesus—
You remember this in Matthew chapter 24,

00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we’ll come back here
—Matthew chapter 24.

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:08.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve been so well-equipped.

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:12.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all here so that we can be a success.

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:15.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13 of Matthew chapter 24:

00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the one who has endured to the end

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[not who showed some endurance,

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:28.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“no, the one who has endured to the end]

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be saved.”

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what we beg Jehovah: “Help us.”

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of the blueprint.

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:38.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to endure to the end.

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:40.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever we have to face,

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s support,
we’re going to succeed.

00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:50.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now after endurance,

00:13:50.646 --> 00:13:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he mentions “godly devotion.”

00:13:53.983 --> 00:13:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, <i>The Watchtower </i>has commented

00:13:56.619 --> 00:13:59.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this in years past.

00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a beautiful thing to keep in mind

00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:07.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why this is so crucial to spiritual success.

00:14:07.663 --> 00:14:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s captured nicely here

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the revised translation—godly devotion.

00:14:13.802 --> 00:14:17.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the thinking there and to try to convey

00:14:17.907 --> 00:14:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was coming across here for all of us

00:14:20.676 --> 00:14:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is you’re devoted

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:26.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or I’m devoted to Jehovah personally

00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this attachment to him personally.

00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So some of you are married couples.

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you want your mate

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be attached to your God

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you worship together.

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what is going to make a success.

00:14:47.002 --> 00:14:51.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly devotion
—being personally attached to Jehovah.

00:14:51.373 --> 00:14:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It affects every aspect of our life.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re attached to him.
It’s personal.

00:14:58.614 --> 00:15:01.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just something special,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone should have that feeling

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:07.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of not just devotion,

00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:09.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, but attachment to him.

00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:11.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love him.
We’re whole-souled.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You get exclusive devotion.’

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:17.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, just thinking about him,
and you can’t see them,

00:15:17.766 --> 00:15:21.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I got goose bumps on my back,

00:15:21.737 --> 00:15:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking about the love for him
—the attachment to him.

00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how nice when,
if you are married, your mate has that.

00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:32.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to succeed.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Devotion to Him personally

00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:40.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all that he has shown and will show

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s just very personal.

00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:45.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next

00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:49.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he attaches after godly devotion,

00:15:49.598 --> 00:15:53.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brotherly affection”

00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:56.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“brotherly affection.”

00:15:56.772 --> 00:16:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you think about that now—

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:03.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciated Brother Noumair’s comments.

00:16:03.846 --> 00:16:07.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw this yesterday while with you
for a couple of lectures

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:12.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then saw some of you
after your last class,

00:16:12.154 --> 00:16:16.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Noumair mentioned
how you enjoy each other’s company.

00:16:16.992 --> 00:16:21.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what he was describing
was your brotherly affection for each other.

00:16:21.797 --> 00:16:24.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s real; it’s genuine.

00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have that brotherly affection.

00:16:26.602 --> 00:16:29.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That should be true in all the congregations.

00:16:29.304 --> 00:16:31.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve displayed it.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to succeed,
you’ve got to continue to do that.

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s something
for you to think about, though,

00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:40.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because commendably
you’ve done well with that.

00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you
are going to take it back with you

00:16:42.618 --> 00:16:46.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this need for godly devotion.

00:16:46.488 --> 00:16:49.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to do that.
I’m counting on it.

00:16:49.725 --> 00:16:51.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, here’s a thought for you

00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:55.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1 Thessalonians chapter 4

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:59.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Thessalonians

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 4.

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:05.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just something to consider

00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you soon-to-be graduates),

00:17:08.644 --> 00:17:12.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take it with you to your assignments.

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Thessalonians 4:9

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:20.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then here in the 10th verse as well:

00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:25.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, concerning brotherly love,

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:28.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you do not need us to write to you,

00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:33.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you yourselves
are taught by God to love one another.

00:17:33.602 --> 00:17:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, you are doing so

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:39.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia.

00:17:39.908 --> 00:17:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now notice this.
This is a thought-provoking point.]

00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But we urge you, brothers,

00:17:48.951 --> 00:17:53.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go on doing so in fuller measure.”

00:17:53.589 --> 00:17:56.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that applies to you too.

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve shown it during your class.

00:18:01.196 --> 00:18:03.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I want you to think about it
from time to time

00:18:03.732 --> 00:18:06.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you’re a spiritual success.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:11.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got to ask yourself,
individually particularly,

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe as a couple if you wish,

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you doing it in fuller measure?

00:18:18.747 --> 00:18:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a lot to think about,
seeing as things get more and more critical.

00:18:22.918 --> 00:18:24.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good point.

00:18:24.987 --> 00:18:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need this godly expression here

00:18:28.724 --> 00:18:30.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brotherly affection.

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:32.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our brothers.

00:18:32.995 --> 00:18:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We forgive each other, but we have this.

00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s got to get fuller,
and we know you’re going to do that.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll think about it.

00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:46.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just examine yourself
from time to time with this blueprint.

00:18:46.508 --> 00:18:50.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you showing brotherly affection
in fuller measure?

00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:53.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you might get back—
I know we’re all different.

00:18:53.515 --> 00:18:56.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know your circumstances,

00:18:56.485 --> 00:18:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obviously God does and Christ Jesus does,

00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:02.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some might say:

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:06.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Boy, she’s just filled
with brotherly affection.

00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’s amazing.

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t remember that about her

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before (or him).’

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now sisters, I don’t want you
to feel like I’m picking on you.

00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:20.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same applies to the brothers.

00:19:20.943 --> 00:19:25.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But show love and brotherly affection
in fuller measure.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something
to think about from time to time.

00:19:27.783 --> 00:19:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now back here

00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:34.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Peter’s second letter,

00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:37.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is the last thought

00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he puts into the blueprint:

00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your godly devotion brotherly affection,”

00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then notice,
“to your brotherly affection love.”

00:19:48.237 --> 00:19:51.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that has reference to <i>a·gaʹpe</i>.

00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:53.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brotherly affection

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:57.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a unique expression of brothers
—that love for them.

00:19:57.579 --> 00:20:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is a principled love, as you know.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s governed by principle.

00:20:03.852 --> 00:20:07.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the kind of love
we need to keep on preaching

00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because people
are going to get more and more

00:20:11.827 --> 00:20:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distinct with their contempt for us.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s growing in most countries.

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:21.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe</i> is going to move us
to keep on going.

00:20:21.403 --> 00:20:26.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how they mistreat us
and what they say or do,

00:20:26.108 --> 00:20:29.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to show love
until Jehovah says:

00:20:29.444 --> 00:20:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s it. No more preaching.”

00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:36.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about our time right now
because of this threat.

00:20:36.084 --> 00:20:39.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are these national security problems
in different countries.

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:43.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Metropolitan preaching
in many countries is not happening.

00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:49.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Door-to-door preaching is a problem.

00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:52.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Memorial campaign is—

00:20:52.267 --> 00:20:54.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different things are going on.

00:20:54.536 --> 00:20:58.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given his spirit
to the Governing Body

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to do the right thing

00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:04.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to respect Caesar and obey Him as our ruler.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:06.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes you think:

00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:10.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What are the inactive
or others that have known about the truth—?

00:21:10.285 --> 00:21:12.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they thinking?’

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we hope the best for them.

00:21:14.323 --> 00:21:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you better move.
This is serious business.”

00:21:19.328 --> 00:21:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our <i>a·ga</i><i>ʹ</i><i>pe</i> love is going to help us
to try to reach out to them.

00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is the time for action
because the day is coming.

00:21:28.837 --> 00:21:32.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it; it’s over.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:35.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once that great tribulation
breaks out, that’s it.

00:21:35.844 --> 00:21:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t help.
It’s over for them.

00:21:39.448 --> 00:21:43.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those are the nine parts

00:21:43.652 --> 00:21:46.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the blueprint for spiritual success.

00:21:46.822 --> 00:21:50.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the thought here

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:52.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that’s what we want to conclude with)

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 8:

00:21:54.262 --> 00:21:56.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if these things exist in you

00:21:56.965 --> 00:22:01.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice] and overflow,

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will prevent you
from being either inactive

00:22:05.107 --> 00:22:07.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or unfruitful
regarding the accurate knowledge

00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

00:22:09.978 --> 00:22:11.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there it is.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re just exhorting
you precious ones soon to graduate:

00:22:16.818 --> 00:22:20.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let it just exist (the blueprint).

00:22:20.822 --> 00:22:23.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let all of this overflow,

00:22:23.825 --> 00:22:28.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you are guaranteed to be
a spiritual success.

The theme of my opening talk
to you dear Gilead students,

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really for all of us,

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Imitate Jesus’ Modesty.”

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:16.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first we ask,
What is modesty?

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a common definition
found in our publications is

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘being aware of our own limitations.’

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus, of course, set a perfect example

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in always being aware

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:33.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his own limitations.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Undoubtedly, Jesus was very familiar

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s thinking on this quality,

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as is expressed at Micah 6:8,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was written about 700 years
before Jesus came to the earth.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he certainly would have been
familiar with this.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, if you recall, the question is asked,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What is Jehovah requiring of you?”

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then part of the answer is

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s an exclamation point
after that expression.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would not just like to see it in us;

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:13.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s requiring it.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew it was not optional,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a requirement,
that we be modest in walking with our God.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:25.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since Jesus
is our perfect role model,

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:28.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s discuss four areas

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can imitate his modesty.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know
that’ll be helpful to you dear students

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really, for all of us.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, Jesus was always aware

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had authority limitations.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember
the account in Matthew chapter 20,

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when James and John tried to use their mother

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get some special positions
in the Kingdom for them.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, they had her say to Jesus:

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give the word that these two sons 
of mine may sit down,

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“one at your right hand and one at your left,

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your Kingdom.”

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:13.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that?

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:15.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was Jesus’ answer?

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To sit down
at my right hand and my left

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is not mine to give,

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it belongs to those

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:28.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:29.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s interesting.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave many gifts, didn’t he?

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave a lot of wine

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a newly married couple
at their wedding feast.

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:40.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave the gift of healing 
to thousands, probably.

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He fed thousands; he gave them food.

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave a widow her son back after he died.

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:51.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus knew to give away

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second and third
highest positions in the Kingdom

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was beyond the scope of his authority.

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:01.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he acknowledged that very clearly, 
didn’t he?

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a fine lesson for us, isn’t it?

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things
that are within the scope of our authority,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can go ahead
and take the initiative and do those things.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are many other things
that are outside the scope of our authority.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you wives,

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:19.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know there are many things in the family

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:22.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have to be decided by the husband

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not within your authority.

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brothers know there are many decisions

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are made in the congregation
that can’t be made by you;

00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it must be made by the body of elders.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know that in our Bethel department

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many things
that require permission from our overseer.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If some of you brothers here in the class

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:47.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
end up later serving on Branch Committees,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you’ll need to clearly learn
the parameters of your authority

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:57.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what you can handle and what really needs 
to be handled by the Branch Committee

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even taken
to the Governing Body.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In areas such as the foregoing,

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us need to carefully learn
what falls within our authority

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what falls outside of our authority.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re in doubt,

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s better to check, isn’t it?

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s better to check if we’re in doubt.

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:18.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have the attitude

00:04:18.908 --> 00:04:22.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s easier to get
forgiveness than permission.

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not a good attitude, is it?

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:30.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another aspect 
of Jesus having authority limitations—

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:34.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to John chapter 12,

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:38.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s an interesting thought
that Jesus made.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:43.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 12:49
—he said:

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I have not spoken

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of my own initiative,

00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:51.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the Father who sent me

00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:55.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has himself given me a commandment

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what to say and what to speak.”

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:01.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you could say according to that

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:05.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus had
speaking-authority limitations, didn’t he?

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had no authority to go

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:11.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond what his Father had taught him.

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had no authority to teach others things

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that originated in his own mind and heart.

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wouldn’t go beyond that.

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:20.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had authority limitations.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even more so,
shouldn’t that be true of us?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have no authority
to give our opinions on matters,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to make sure when we speak

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what we say
is solidly based on the Scriptures

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what’s been provided
by the faithful slave.

00:05:37.987 --> 00:05:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s go to our second area
where we can learn modesty from Jesus:

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always remembered
his lesser importance

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared 
to Jehovah’s much greater importance.

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How unlike Satan the Devil!

00:05:57.173 --> 00:06:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you could say he has
not one modest bone in his spirit body,

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
figuratively speaking, of course

00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no modesty in Satan the Devil.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus refused to accept titles
that belonged to Jehovah.

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you call me good?

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:20.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is good except one, God.”

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always gave the credit
—the glory—to Jehovah.

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:27.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “The Son cannot do 
a single thing of his own initiative,

00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:31.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but only what he sees the Father doing.”

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never boasted.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always willing
to put Jehovah’s will ahead of his own will.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made the comment:

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Father, if it is not possible

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for this to pass away unless I drink it,

00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your will take place.”

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:

00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:53.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never tried to draw attention to himself

00:06:53.963 --> 00:06:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of high-sounding vocabulary

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even by means of his dress and grooming.

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:04.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, if he would have had
some unusual dress or grooming,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would Judas have needed to kiss him
to identify which one he was?

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:09.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could’ve said,

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:12.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one you’re looking for
is the only one in the group

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:15.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wearing a bright purple robe,”

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “He’s the only one in the group
that has a handlebar mustache.”

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wouldn’t have had to kiss him
to identify him.

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you look at the pictures
in our publications

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jesus and the Twelve,

00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be hard to describe
which one he was.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He modestly blended in
with all of the others.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what a fine example for us!

00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others try to praise us,
including our Bible students,

00:07:41.277 --> 00:07:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should modestly redirect that praise

00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:47.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where it belongs.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:52.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should always give credit to Jehovah
for what we accomplish.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, we accomplish it, 
but we give Jehovah the credit.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 4:7:

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you have that you did not receive?

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, in fact, you did receive it,

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do you boast 
as though you did not receive it?”

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:13.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in harmony (or in the same vein)
with that scripture,

00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:16.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we try hard not to boast,

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:19.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remembering Proverbs 27:2:

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let someone else praise you,

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:25.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not your own mouth.”

00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:28.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do our best
to put Jehovah’s preferences

00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ahead of our own preferences.

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We endeavor not to draw
attention to ourselves

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by high-sounding vocabulary

00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even immodest dress and grooming.

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s go to a third area
where we can learn modesty from Jesus:

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew there were some things

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:50.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was not entitled to know,

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least not at the time.

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to Matthew chapter 24, please.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re familiar with this scripture,

00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at Matthew 24:36,
notice Jesus’ words:

00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:06.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Concerning that day
and hour nobody knows,

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“neither the angels of the heavens

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor the Son,

00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:15.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but only the Father.”

00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about it, if Jesus was content

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:24.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with having knowledge limitations
concerning confidential things,

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then even more so
shouldn’t that be the case with us?

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:33.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should strive very hard
not to ever try to get to know

00:09:33.522 --> 00:09:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidential things
we’re not entitled to know.

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we certainly shouldn’t reveal
confidential things.

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:41.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a protection it is!

00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking,
for you dear wives of elders,

00:09:44.634 --> 00:09:47.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if someone asked you
about a certain confidential matter,

00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:49.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know anything about this?”

00:09:49.405 --> 00:09:53.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you know, which you shouldn’t,
it’s very awkward, isn’t it?

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You either have to be untruthful

00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:59.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you have to reveal that your husband
didn’t keep confidentiality.

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you don’t know,
as should be the case,

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:06.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now with a clear conscience

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can answer that question
with a resounding no.

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, I do not know anything about that.”

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:17.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You dear elders would not try to obtain

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidential information
in the congregation

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:23.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at Bethel you’re not entitled to know.

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus,
all of us should be content

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wait for information

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be revealed to us
at the proper time.

00:10:31.814 --> 00:10:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it, in some cases,

00:10:33.849 --> 00:10:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may mean that we will have to be content

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never know certain things.

00:10:39.522 --> 00:10:41.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s get to our last area,

00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:44.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this fourth area
we can learn modesty from Jesus,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is:

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always aware

00:10:49.632 --> 00:10:54.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his need to fully rely on Jehovah.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though he was perfect,

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not rely on his own strength.

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, to Hebrews chapter 5.

00:11:03.012 --> 00:11:07.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a beautiful scripture
about this perfect Son of God

00:11:07.383 --> 00:11:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what is said about him.

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 5:7:

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During his life on earth,

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ offered up supplications

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and also petitions,

00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:25.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and notice] with strong outcries

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and tears,

00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:31.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the One who was able
to save him out of death,

00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was favorably heard
for his godly fear.”

00:11:35.711 --> 00:11:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, isn’t that interesting?

00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:40.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During his life on earth”

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:42.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and it didn’t say
just a few times or one or two times)

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:46.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—during his life,
he petitioned, and it’s plural.

00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:49.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he gave supplication, again plural.

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what were the intensities

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:55.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those supplications and petitions?

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:59.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With strong outcries and tears”

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:02.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he called for help from Jehovah,
and Jehovah heard him.

00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean,
if you think of the word “outcry,”

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that means “a cry out loud”
—doesn’t it?—

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a strong outcry,

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:15.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very loud cry out loud.

00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:17.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you add tears to that.

00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really indicates the intensity

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:23.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how he really called
on Jehovah to help him.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an interesting thought, isn’t it?

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah sent
Jesus’ younger angelic brothers

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:33.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come and help him in times of need,

00:12:33.969 --> 00:12:37.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t say:
“Well, I don’t need help.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[pridefully] I’m OK. I’ve got this.”

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:44.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he knew he needed help.

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he graciously accepted it
and appreciated that help.

00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:50.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about this:

00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:52.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even with Jehovah’s help,

00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:56.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was modestly realistic
of what he expected of himself.

00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:58.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought about that?

00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,
he was still modestly realistic

00:13:01.964 --> 00:13:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could only accomplish so much.

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
during his three-and-a-half-year ministry,

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knew there were only so many
he could reach—only so many people.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, wisely, what did he do?

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He modestly trained and entrusted others
to do the preaching work

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:20.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even said about them
as recorded at John 14:12

00:13:20.015 --> 00:13:24.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would ‘do works 
<i>greater </i> than his works.’

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would reach
a greater number of people,

00:13:27.122 --> 00:13:31.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a greater area,
a greater period of time.

00:13:31.494 --> 00:13:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about this,
if the perfect Son of God

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:39.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feared to rely on his own strength,

00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should be scared to death to do that.

00:13:41.804 --> 00:13:44.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not rely on our own strength.

00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:47.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never should we pridefully hold back

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from supplicating and petitioning Jehovah

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with strong outcries and tears.

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:58.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we modestly accept
the help Jehovah provides

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through our brothers and sisters.

00:14:01.123 --> 00:14:04.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we be modestly realistic

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of even what we expect of ourselves.

00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we imitate Jesus’ modesty,

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:13.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these four areas we’ve discussed,

00:14:13.068 --> 00:14:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a protection it will be!

00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will protect us
from many snares of the Devil.

00:00:01 The theme of my opening talk to you dear Gilead students,
00:00:06 and really for all of us,
00:00:08 is “Imitate Jesus’ Modesty.”
00:00:12 Now, first we ask, What is modesty?
00:00:16 Well, a common definition found in our publications is
00:00:20 ‘being aware of our own limitations.’
00:00:24 And Jesus, of course, set a perfect example
00:00:27 in always being aware
00:00:30 of his own limitations.
00:00:33 Undoubtedly, Jesus was very familiar
00:00:36 with Jehovah’s thinking on this quality,
00:00:39 such as is expressed at Micah 6:8,
00:00:43 which was written about 700 years before Jesus came to the earth.
00:00:47 So he certainly would have been familiar with this.
00:00:49 But, if you recall, the question is asked,
00:00:52 “What is Jehovah requiring of you?”
00:00:56 And then part of the answer is
00:00:58 “to walk in modesty with your God!”
00:01:03 And there’s an exclamation point after that expression.
00:01:07 Jehovah would not just like to see it in us;
00:01:11 he’s requiring it.
00:01:13 What is Jehovah requiring of you?
00:01:15 Jesus knew it was not optional,
00:01:17 but a requirement, that we be modest in walking with our God.
00:01:21 Now, since Jesus is our perfect role model,
00:01:25 let’s discuss four areas
00:01:28 in which we can imitate his modesty.
00:01:31 And we know that’ll be helpful to you dear students
00:01:34 —really, for all of us.
00:01:36 Number one, Jesus was always aware
00:01:40 that he had authority limitations.
00:01:44 Now, you remember the account in Matthew chapter 20,
00:01:49 when James and John tried to use their mother
00:01:52 to get some special positions in the Kingdom for them.
00:01:57 And remember, they had her say to Jesus:
00:02:01 “Give the word that these two sons  of mine may sit down,
00:02:06 “one at your right hand and one at your left,
00:02:09 in your Kingdom.”
00:02:11 Remember that?
00:02:13 But what was Jesus’ answer?
00:02:15 “To sit down at my right hand and my left
00:02:19 “is not mine to give,
00:02:22 “but it belongs to those
00:02:24 for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
00:02:28 Now, that’s interesting.
00:02:29 Jesus gave many gifts, didn’t he?
00:02:31 He gave a lot of wine
00:02:34 to a newly married couple at their wedding feast.
00:02:36 He gave the gift of healing  to thousands, probably.
00:02:40 He fed thousands; he gave them food.
00:02:43 He gave a widow her son back after he died.
00:02:48 But Jesus knew to give away
00:02:51 the second and third highest positions in the Kingdom
00:02:55 was beyond the scope of his authority.
00:02:57 And he acknowledged that very clearly,  didn’t he?
00:03:01 Well, that’s a fine lesson for us, isn’t it?
00:03:03 There are many things that are within the scope of our authority,
00:03:07 and we can go ahead and take the initiative and do those things.
00:03:10 But there are many other things that are outside the scope of our authority.
00:03:14 For example, you wives,
00:03:16 you know there are many things in the family
00:03:19 that have to be decided by the husband
00:03:22 —not within your authority.
00:03:24 You brothers know there are many decisions
00:03:28 that are made in the congregation that can’t be made by you;
00:03:32 it must be made by the body of elders.
00:03:34 We all know that in our Bethel department
00:03:36 there are many things that require permission from our overseer.
00:03:41 If some of you brothers here in the class
00:03:44 end up later serving on Branch Committees,
00:03:47 then you’ll need to clearly learn the parameters of your authority
00:03:52 —what you can handle and what really needs  to be handled by the Branch Committee
00:03:57 or maybe even taken to the Governing Body.
00:04:00 In areas such as the foregoing,
00:04:03 all of us need to carefully learn what falls within our authority
00:04:08 and what falls outside of our authority.
00:04:10 And if we’re in doubt,
00:04:12 it’s better to check, isn’t it?
00:04:14 It’s better to check if we’re in doubt.
00:04:16 We don’t have the attitude
00:04:18 that it’s easier to get forgiveness than permission.
00:04:22 That’s not a good attitude, is it?
00:04:25 Now, another aspect  of Jesus having authority limitations—
00:04:30 Open up to John chapter 12,
00:04:34 and here’s an interesting thought that Jesus made.
00:04:38 John 12:49 —he said:
00:04:43 “For I have not spoken
00:04:46 “of my own initiative,
00:04:49 “but the Father who sent me
00:04:51 “has himself given me a commandment
00:04:55 about what to say and what to speak.”
00:04:59 Now, you could say according to that
00:05:01 that Jesus had speaking-authority limitations, didn’t he?
00:05:05 He had no authority to go
00:05:07 beyond what his Father had taught him.
00:05:11 He had no authority to teach others things
00:05:13 that originated in his own mind and heart.
00:05:16 He wouldn’t go beyond that.
00:05:18 He had authority limitations.
00:05:20 Well, even more so, shouldn’t that be true of us?
00:05:23 We have no authority to give our opinions on matters,
00:05:28 but we have to make sure when we speak
00:05:30 that what we say is solidly based on the Scriptures
00:05:34 and what’s been provided by the faithful slave.
00:05:37 But now let’s go to our second area where we can learn modesty from Jesus:
00:05:42 He always remembered his lesser importance
00:05:47 compared  to Jehovah’s much greater importance.
00:05:53 How unlike Satan the Devil!
00:05:57 Now, you could say he has not one modest bone in his spirit body,
00:06:02 figuratively speaking, of course
00:06:05 —no modesty in Satan the Devil.
00:06:08 Jesus refused to accept titles that belonged to Jehovah.
00:06:13 “Why do you call me good?
00:06:15 Nobody is good except one, God.”
00:06:20 He always gave the credit —the glory—to Jehovah.
00:06:23 He said: “The Son cannot do  a single thing of his own initiative,
00:06:27 but only what he sees the Father doing.”
00:06:31 He never boasted.
00:06:33 He was always willing to put Jehovah’s will ahead of his own will.
00:06:37 He made the comment:
00:06:39 “Father, if it is not possible
00:06:43 “for this to pass away unless I drink it,
00:06:46 let your will take place.”
00:06:49 And think about this:
00:06:51 He never tried to draw attention to himself
00:06:53 by means of high-sounding vocabulary
00:06:56 or even by means of his dress and grooming.
00:06:59 See, if he would have had some unusual dress or grooming,
00:07:04 would Judas have needed to kiss him to identify which one he was?
00:07:07 He could’ve said,
00:07:09 “The one you’re looking for is the only one in the group
00:07:12 wearing a bright purple robe,”
00:07:15 or “He’s the only one in the group that has a handlebar mustache.”
00:07:19 He wouldn’t have had to kiss him to identify him.
00:07:21 And if you look at the pictures in our publications
00:07:24 with Jesus and the Twelve,
00:07:26 it would be hard to describe which one he was.
00:07:30 He modestly blended in with all of the others.
00:07:34 Now, what a fine example for us!
00:07:36 When others try to praise us, including our Bible students,
00:07:41 we should modestly redirect that praise
00:07:45 to where it belongs.
00:07:47 We should always give credit to Jehovah for what we accomplish.
00:07:52 I mean, we accomplish it,  but we give Jehovah the credit.
00:07:55 First Corinthians 4:7:
00:07:58 “What do you have that you did not receive?
00:08:02 “If, in fact, you did receive it,
00:08:05 why do you boast  as though you did not receive it?”
00:08:08 And in harmony (or in the same vein) with that scripture,
00:08:13 we try hard not to boast,
00:08:16 remembering Proverbs 27:2:
00:08:19 “Let someone else praise you,
00:08:22 and not your own mouth.”
00:08:25 We do our best to put Jehovah’s preferences
00:08:28 ahead of our own preferences.
00:08:30 We endeavor not to draw attention to ourselves
00:08:32 by high-sounding vocabulary
00:08:36 or even immodest dress and grooming.
00:08:40 But now let’s go to a third area where we can learn modesty from Jesus:
00:08:44 He knew there were some things
00:08:46 he was not entitled to know,
00:08:50 at least not at the time.
00:08:52 Open up to Matthew chapter 24, please.
00:08:55 And we’re familiar with this scripture,
00:08:57 but at Matthew 24:36, notice Jesus’ words:
00:09:02 “Concerning that day and hour nobody knows,
00:09:06 “neither the angels of the heavens
00:09:09 “nor the Son,
00:09:12 but only the Father.”
00:09:15 Now, think about it, if Jesus was content
00:09:19 with having knowledge limitations concerning confidential things,
00:09:24 then even more so shouldn’t that be the case with us?
00:09:28 We should strive very hard not to ever try to get to know
00:09:33 confidential things we’re not entitled to know.
00:09:36 And we certainly shouldn’t reveal confidential things.
00:09:39 And what a protection it is!
00:09:41 I was thinking, for you dear wives of elders,
00:09:44 if someone asked you about a certain confidential matter,
00:09:47 “Do you know anything about this?”
00:09:49 Now, if you know, which you shouldn’t, it’s very awkward, isn’t it?
00:09:53 You either have to be untruthful
00:09:55 or you have to reveal that your husband didn’t keep confidentiality.
00:09:59 But if you don’t know, as should be the case,
00:10:03 now with a clear conscience
00:10:06 you can answer that question with a resounding no.
00:10:09 “No, I do not know anything about that.”
00:10:13 You dear elders would not try to obtain
00:10:17 confidential information in the congregation
00:10:19 or at Bethel you’re not entitled to know.
00:10:23 Like Jesus, all of us should be content
00:10:26 to wait for information
00:10:28 to be revealed to us at the proper time.
00:10:31 And if you think about it, in some cases,
00:10:33 it may mean that we will have to be content
00:10:36 to never know certain things.
00:10:39 Now, let’s get to our last area,
00:10:41 this fourth area we can learn modesty from Jesus,
00:10:44 and that is:
00:10:46 He was always aware
00:10:49 of his need to fully rely on Jehovah.
00:10:54 Even though he was perfect,
00:10:57 he did not rely on his own strength.
00:11:00 Open, please, to Hebrews chapter 5.
00:11:03 This is a beautiful scripture about this perfect Son of God
00:11:07 —what is said about him.
00:11:09 Hebrews 5:7:
00:11:12 “During his life on earth,
00:11:15 “Christ offered up supplications
00:11:19 “and also petitions,
00:11:21 “[and notice] with strong outcries
00:11:25 “and tears,
00:11:27 “to the One who was able to save him out of death,
00:11:31 and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.”
00:11:35 Now, isn’t that interesting?
00:11:37 “During his life on earth”
00:11:40 (and it didn’t say just a few times or one or two times)
00:11:42 —during his life, he petitioned, and it’s plural.
00:11:46 And he gave supplication, again plural.
00:11:49 And what were the intensities
00:11:52 of those supplications and petitions?
00:11:55 “With strong outcries and tears”
00:11:59 he called for help from Jehovah, and Jehovah heard him.
00:12:02 I mean, if you think of the word “outcry,”
00:12:06 that means “a cry out loud” —doesn’t it?—
00:12:09 a strong outcry,
00:12:11 a very loud cry out loud.
00:12:15 And then you add tears to that.
00:12:17 It really indicates the intensity
00:12:19 —how he really called on Jehovah to help him.
00:12:23 That’s an interesting thought, isn’t it?
00:12:26 Additionally,
00:12:28 when Jehovah sent Jesus’ younger angelic brothers
00:12:31 to come and help him in times of need,
00:12:33 he didn’t say: “Well, I don’t need help.
00:12:37 [pridefully] I’m OK. I’ve got this.”
00:12:41 No, he knew he needed help.
00:12:44 And he graciously accepted it and appreciated that help.
00:12:48 Think about this:
00:12:50 Even with Jehovah’s help,
00:12:52 he was modestly realistic of what he expected of himself.
00:12:56 Have you ever thought about that?
00:12:58 With Jehovah’s help, he was still modestly realistic
00:13:01 that he could only accomplish so much.
00:13:03 As an example, during his three-and-a-half-year ministry,
00:13:06 he knew there were only so many he could reach—only so many people.
00:13:10 So, wisely, what did he do?
00:13:12 He modestly trained and entrusted others to do the preaching work
00:13:16 and even said about them as recorded at John 14:12
00:13:20 that they would ‘do works  greater  than his works.’
00:13:24 They would reach a greater number of people,
00:13:27 a greater area, a greater period of time.
00:13:31 Now, think about this, if the perfect Son of God
00:13:35 feared to rely on his own strength,
00:13:39 we should be scared to death to do that.
00:13:41 We do not rely on our own strength.
00:13:44 Never should we pridefully hold back
00:13:47 from supplicating and petitioning Jehovah
00:13:50 with strong outcries and tears.
00:13:55 May we modestly accept the help Jehovah provides
00:13:58 through our brothers and sisters.
00:14:01 May we be modestly realistic
00:14:04 of even what we expect of ourselves.
00:14:07 If we imitate Jesus’ modesty,
00:14:10 these four areas we’ve discussed,
00:14:13 what a protection it will be!
00:14:15 It will protect us from many snares of the Devil.

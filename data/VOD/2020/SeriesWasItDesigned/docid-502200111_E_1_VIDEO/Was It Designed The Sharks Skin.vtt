Sharks have skin

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that protects them in a unique way.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Left unchecked,

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
microorganisms would establish
colonies on the shark’s skin,

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which in turn would attract larger parasites

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to latch on to the shark.

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that happened,

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the shark’s health
and ability to swim would suffer.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:37.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the shark’s skin
remains virtually free of parasites.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:46.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sharkskin is covered in complex scales

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
called dermal denticles.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.740 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Though they look like tiny fish scales,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are built more like mammal teeth

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a smooth enamel surface.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This very smooth surface,

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together with a complex structure

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of tiny ridges,

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes it very hard for microscopic organisms

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grab on to the shark’s skin.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If one does latch on,

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those same ridges channel water

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to flow faster and wash off the hitchhiker.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this single design element

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resists parasites in two different ways.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The denticles’ unique shape

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
creates small areas of suction

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all along the shark’s body,

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:39.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enhancing its ability
to thrust itself forward as it swims.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These advantages
allow sharks like the shortfin mako

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach burst speeds

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:48.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 74 kilometers (46 mi) per hour!

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scientists are engineering
artificial surfaces

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:56.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that mimic sharkskin

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help boats and planes

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:00.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be more fuel efficient.

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:05.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This nature-inspired technology
could also prevent

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
harmful germs from growing
on hospital surfaces

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:11.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without having to use
toxic disinfectants.

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did sharkskin simply evolve?

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:21.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

Far from Israel lived a Jew

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom the king of Persia

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:09.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusted with his life.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He believed his people were carrying

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on pure worship in Jerusalem

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until one day . . .

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the people ignore God’s Law.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebuilding the walls was only the beginning.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many powerful enemies.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recommend we turn

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is going to tell him?

00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my province!

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a right to live where I choose,

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so do you.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would need help to face what

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about to come next.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every man must find 

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:12.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own joy, and I intend to find mine.

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should you complain

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:16.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when everyone else approves?

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we let mere threats

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
frighten us into stopping, they will have

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
achieved their goal.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to wait

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they start killing us?

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re powerless to stop this.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do remember me favorably, O my God.

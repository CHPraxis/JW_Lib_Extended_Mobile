00:00:02 “Keep on the watch.”
00:00:04 That’s what Jesus told his disciples
00:00:07 after describing the events
00:00:09 of the last days.
00:00:11 How long have you been keeping on the watch?
00:00:15 We’re certainly experiencing
00:00:17 “critical times hard to deal with.”
00:00:21 These are the conditions
00:00:23 we’ve been preaching about for years.
00:00:27 In this update, let’s review
00:00:29 some of the prophecies being fulfilled
00:00:32 right before our eyes
00:00:34 and reflect on the timeliness
00:00:37 of the November campaign publicizing God’s Kingdom.
00:00:43 First, think about the sign Jesus gave his disciples.
00:00:48 At Luke 21:11, Jesus said
00:00:51 we would see “food shortages and pestilences”
00:00:55 “in one place after another.”
00:00:58 Well, we are now experiencing
00:01:01 the fulfillment of this part of the sign
00:01:04 in a very pronounced way.
00:01:07 A second prophecy to consider
00:01:10 is recorded in Daniel chapter 2.
00:01:14 There we read about an immense image representing
00:01:17 a succession of human kingdoms
00:01:20 from the Babylonian Empire down to today.
00:01:25 The feet and toes at the bottom of that image
00:01:29 represent the Anglo-American World Power,
00:01:32 and Daniel tells us
00:01:34 they are “partly of iron and partly of clay.”
00:01:39 Do you remember what this mix of hard iron
00:01:42 and soft clay represents?
00:01:45 The clay pictures the radical and popular elements
00:01:50 within the sphere of the United States and Britain
00:01:53 that weaken its ability to act
00:01:56 with ironlike strength.
00:02:00 Daniel 2:43 says:
00:02:03 “They will not stick together, one to the other.”
00:02:09 The Watchtower  of June 15, 2012,
00:02:12 pointed out clear evidence
00:02:15 of the iron and clay when it said:
00:02:18 “Opposing ideologies
00:02:21 “and close election results
00:02:23 “that do not end up in a clear majority
00:02:27 “have weakened the power base
00:02:29 “of even popular leaders,
00:02:31 “so that they have no clear mandate
00:02:34 to implement their policies.”
00:02:38 Would you agree that this is more evident now
00:02:41 than eight years ago when this was published?
00:02:46 Reflecting on the fulfillment of Bible prophecy
00:02:49 that we are seeing right now can fortify our faith.
00:02:54 In the following interview,
00:02:56 Brother Richard Kelsey, who was baptized in 1941,
00:03:01 shares his thoughts about what’s helped him
00:03:04 to keep on the watch for some 80 years.
00:03:10 I was baptized in June 1941
00:03:13 in Des Moines, Iowa,
00:03:15 at the same time as Peggy,
00:03:17 and we were baptized in a horse watering tank there.
00:03:21 And this was shortly before the international convention
00:03:24 in St. Louis, Missouri.
00:03:27 We, as youngsters and children,
00:03:29 were all asked to sit in the first rows
00:03:31 in front of the stage, and Brother Rutherford
00:03:35 gave the talk “Children of the King.”
00:03:38 And during this talk
00:03:40 at the conclusion, he said,
00:03:42 ‘There is a new book, the Children  book,
00:03:45 and you will all get a free copy.’
00:03:47 That motivated me greatly.
00:03:49 And, of course, when it was studied later,
00:03:52 that was even a greater motivation to serve Jehovah.
00:03:56 I started pioneering in September 1948,
00:04:00 but I had already auxiliary pioneered and, of course, that whetted
00:04:05 my appetite for full-time service.
00:04:08 We see world conditions worsening, and that could frighten us.
00:04:12 It could be that faithful older ones could become discouraged
00:04:16 after many years, and it’s very important
00:04:19 to have a close relationship with Jehovah
00:04:23 —an intimate relationship.
00:04:25 We look forward to his Kingdom rule
00:04:27 as a solution for all problems.
00:04:30 Young ones will see the faithfulness
00:04:33 of the older ones and will want
00:04:36 to imitate their faith.
00:04:38 And, of course, that’s pleasing to Jehovah.
00:04:41 Well, when we heard that there was going
00:04:43 to be a special campaign now,
00:04:45 Peggy and I—my wife and I—applied
00:04:48 for auxiliary pioneer service.
00:04:51 We have been preaching God’s Kingdom for many years,
00:04:55 and now there is a special campaign
00:04:58 devoted to that subject, God’s Kingdom.
00:05:01 And it’s going to be a highlight
00:05:03 in our many years of service to Jehovah.
00:05:08 Like Brother Kelsey,
00:05:10 has your confidence in Jehovah’s promises
00:05:13 been strengthened by what you see happening today?
00:05:17 People around the world realize
00:05:20 how unusual it is to have a pandemic,
00:05:23 food shortages, civil unrest, earthquakes,
00:05:27 and other disasters all occur at the same time.
00:05:31 Watching the fulfillment of Bible prophecies builds our confidence
00:05:36 in other prophecies yet to be fulfilled
00:05:40 —prophecies that promise permanent relief
00:05:43 from the problems we’re dealing with.
00:05:46 For example, as Daniel 2:44 tells us,
00:05:51 soon God’s Kingdom will become the only government
00:05:55 ruling over the earth—forever!
00:05:59 Isn’t it exciting that, amidst these critical times,
00:06:03 we’re participating in a special campaign
00:06:06 clearly pointing people to the only real solution,
00:06:11 God’s Kingdom?
00:06:14 Some who were once associated with Jehovah’s organization
00:06:17 are also recognizing the fulfillment of Bible prophecy
00:06:22 and have been motivated to come back.
00:06:25 If you are inactive or disfellowshipped,
00:06:29 we encourage you to speak to the elders in your local congregation;
00:06:34 they’ll be happy to assist you.

00:06:51 Just a few days into the November campaign,
00:06:55 a sister in France got a call from a telemarketer.
00:06:59 Let’s listen as Brother Bruno Faure
00:07:01 explains how she took advantage
00:07:03 of the opportunity to advertise the Kingdom.
00:08:59 Clearly, the zealous efforts of our brothers in France
00:09:03 and around the world are resulting in a great witness.
00:09:08 Many people are surprised to see
00:09:11 how quickly things have changed in 2020.
00:09:15 Just a few months ago, life was very different.
00:09:20 This is a very good lesson for us
00:09:22 on how fast things can change in the future.
00:09:27 After saying the words “keep on the watch”
00:09:30 at Matthew 24:42,
00:09:34 notice what Jesus said about the suddenness
00:09:37 of these events that would occur and how we should react.
00:09:43 Matthew 24:42-44 says:
00:09:49 “Keep on the watch, therefore,
00:09:51 “because you do not know ‏
00:09:53 “on what day your Lord is coming.
00:09:56 “But know one thing:
00:09:58 “If the householder had known
00:10:01 “in what watch the thief was coming,
00:10:04 “he would have kept awake
00:10:06 “and not allowed his house to be broken into.
00:10:09 “On this account,
00:10:11 “you too prove yourselves ready,
00:10:14 “because the Son of man [Jesus]
00:10:17 “is coming at an hour that you
00:10:19 do not think to be it.”
00:10:22 Hasn’t the fast-changing world situation
00:10:25 heightened your appreciation
00:10:27 for the need to “prove yourselves ready”?
00:10:31 Rather than allowing distractions to diminish
00:10:35 our spiritual alertness,
00:10:37 now more than ever we need to pray,
00:10:41 study, attend meetings,
00:10:44 and stay active in the ministry.
00:10:48 Thank you to all of you who have worked tirelessly
00:10:52 on this Kingdom campaign.
00:10:55 If you haven’t participated in the campaign yet,
00:10:58 be sure to do so.
00:11:00 What a privilege it is to advertise the Kingdom
00:11:05 —the solution to all of mankind’s problems!
00:11:09 By doing so, we can “keep on the watch”
00:11:13 and ‘prove ourselves ready.’
00:11:18 Please be assured of our constant prayers in your behalf
00:11:22 and our warmest love.

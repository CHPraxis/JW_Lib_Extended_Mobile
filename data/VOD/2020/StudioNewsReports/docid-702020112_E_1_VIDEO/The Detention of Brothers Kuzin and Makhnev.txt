00:00:09 On June 26, 2019, in Kaluga, Russia,
00:00:13 mass searches were carried out in the homes of peaceful believers.
00:00:16 Two of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:18 Roman Makhnev and Dmitriy Kuzin,
00:00:20 were arrested simply because of their religion.
00:00:23 I heard a commotion on the street.
00:00:26 When I went out, I saw two masked men in the courtyard.
00:00:30 I took the keys for the gate and opened the door.
00:00:32 Several more men were there.
00:00:34 My daughter came out.
00:00:35 She was barefoot,
00:00:37 and they made her stand next to me on the courtyard flagstone.
00:00:41 It was drizzling.
00:00:43 I asked to let the child put shoes on.
00:00:45 He said, “Later.”
00:00:47 The believer, Roman Makhnev,
00:00:51 was handcuffed, even though in no way
00:00:54 was he ever aggressive or disorderly.
00:00:57 At the same time, another group of security forces burst
00:01:00 into Dmitriy and Svetlana Kuzin’s apartment.
00:01:04 I was here in this room at home,
00:01:06 watering my plants.
00:01:07 I heard my husband unlocking the door.
00:01:11 I went out of the room and saw a bunch of people.
00:01:14 My husband had obviously been knocked down
00:01:16 face-first to the tile floor as he came in.
00:01:20 His hands were handcuffed behind his back.
00:01:22 Yet another group of armed law-enforcement officers
00:01:25 raided the home of 87-year-old Olga Verevkina.
00:01:30 There was a full SWAT team in camouflage.
00:01:33 No warrant was shown.
00:01:35 They demanded, “Get up!”
00:01:38 I said: “I can’t.
00:01:40 I’m infirm.”
00:01:42 My blood pressure went up to 200/115.
00:01:46 According to the believers, during the searches,
00:01:49 publications from the Federal List of Extremist Materials were planted
00:01:53 in their homes and their rights were violated.
00:01:57 I heard Dasha scream: “This was not in my room!
00:02:00 Explain to me how it got here!”
00:02:02 And I heard my husband’s voice, saying, “This was planted.”
00:02:06 Just that afternoon,
00:02:08 I was vacuuming under the bed,
00:02:09 and there was nothing there.
00:02:11 No one identified himself.
00:02:13 No documents were shown.
00:02:15 The search began at 9:00 in the evening
00:02:19 and lasted until about 4:30 in the morning.
00:02:23 But for camouflaged security forces
00:02:28 to burst in on old, infirm people
00:02:32 —that’s unbelievable!
00:02:34 It’s quite interesting.
00:02:35 In order to deal with an elderly woman,
00:02:38 our law-enforcement officers come en masse,
00:02:41 wearing masks, and carrying weapons.
00:02:44 What cowards!
00:02:46 And these people claim that they are actually fighting extremism.
00:02:51 After the searches, Roman Makhnev and Dmitriy Kuzin
00:02:55 were taken to the FSB building.
00:02:57 When Papa was taken away, the only thing I managed to whisper to him
00:03:01 was that I was proud of his integrity.
00:03:03 And then they took him away, and I felt sad.
00:03:07 I was scared.
00:03:14 When they brought Roman to the FSB building,
00:03:17 he was handcuffed to a radiator
00:03:20 in some sort of utility room
00:03:23 and was kept like this until he was called
00:03:25 for questioning in the morning.
00:03:28 It is noteworthy that several hours earlier, during the searches,
00:03:31 an ambulance was called for Roman Makhnev.
00:03:35 Roman became very ill.
00:03:37 Dasha started to scream.
00:03:39 The FSB called an ambulance, and it came quickly enough.
00:03:42 He was given medication, and then he felt better.
00:03:46 Roman was arrested on the 26th, and they didn’t feed him until the 29th.
00:03:50 Roman Makhnev was given no food for three days.
00:03:54 They said,
00:03:56 “Well, he could eat  whatever he brought with him.”
00:03:58 Interesting.
00:03:59 I have filed complaints with various agencies.
00:04:03 On June 28, two days after their arrest,
00:04:06 the Kaluzhskiy District Court sent
00:04:08 Roman Makhnev and Dmitriy Kuzin to a detention center.
00:04:20 I hope that people will realize
00:04:22 that my dad is not guilty of anything,
00:04:24 and he is not a criminal.
00:04:25 Therefore, I hope that soon he’ll be back,
00:04:28 and we will be together again.
00:04:29 The believers do not agree with the charges,
00:04:32 and they intend to seek justice.
00:04:36 I don’t know if we’ll be able to, but I’m determined to fight
00:04:40 to the end to help my husband
00:04:42 and to support him.
00:04:44 I very much hope that common sense will prevail
00:04:50 and that the authorities will finally realize
00:04:52 that we do not present a threat to society,
00:04:55 much less to the State.

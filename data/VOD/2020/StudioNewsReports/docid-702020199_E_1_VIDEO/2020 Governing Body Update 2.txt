00:00:01 Hello, everyone!
00:00:03 I bring you warm greetings
00:00:06 from the Governing Body
00:00:07 and the United States Bethel family.
00:00:10 We want you to know that we love you all very much,
00:00:13 we’re concerned about you,
00:00:15 and we pray for you each and every day.
00:00:20 We know that more and more of you are being affected
00:00:22 by the coronavirus pandemic.
00:00:24 You can’t go to work.
00:00:26 You can’t go to school.
00:00:28 You can’t go to the Kingdom Hall or preach from house to house.
00:00:32 Some of you have lost your jobs,
00:00:35 and you have no idea how you are going to be able to feed your family.
00:00:39 Others have family members who live far away.
00:00:42 There’s no one else in the house.
00:00:44 They’re worried about them.
00:00:46 And sadly, some are mourning the loss of loved ones
00:00:50 who have been victims of the disease.
00:00:53 We want you to know that our hearts ache for you.
00:00:56 We’re so sorry for your loss.
00:01:00 Now, these are very stressful times,
00:01:02 but it’s important to remember one thing:
00:01:05 No friend of Jehovah
00:01:08 is ever truly alone.
00:01:12 Through his holy spirit, Jehovah can help us;
00:01:16 he can sustain us even if there’s no one else in the house.
00:01:20 Another way Jehovah is helping us
00:01:22 is by means of caring shepherds.
00:01:25 And this is in line with the promise that he himself made.
00:01:28 We’re going to read Jeremiah 23:4,
00:01:32 and you’ll see how this prophecy is being fulfilled today.
00:01:36 I’m just going to read a part of it.
00:01:39 Here’s the promise Jehovah made:
00:01:41 that he was going to “raise up . . . shepherds
00:01:44 who will really shepherd them.”
00:01:47 And then at the end it says:
00:01:49 “None [of them] will be missing.”
00:01:53 Well, can you see how that promise
00:01:55 is being fulfilled today in the elders?
00:01:58 Just think of all the work our elders are doing
00:02:01 to make sure that we don’t miss out on spiritual food, for example.
00:02:05 They are arranging for us to tie in to congregation meetings,
00:02:08 they set up shepherding calls using videoconferencing,
00:02:13 they arrange for meetings for field service,
00:02:15 and they make sure we have telephone territory
00:02:18 and letter-writing territory.
00:02:20 Of course, these shepherds
00:02:22 are also concerned about your physical well-being.
00:02:25 So from time to time, they may also check in on us
00:02:28 to make sure that we have basic food items,
00:02:31 medications, and other necessary things.
00:02:34 If they do that, don’t be shy:
00:02:37 Let the elders know your needs.
00:02:40 They may also provide practical suggestions on how you can protect your health.
00:02:46 Now, as you can imagine, when the pandemic broke out,
00:02:49 the elders had a lot of questions.
00:02:52 They’d never dealt with this before.
00:02:54 And suddenly, they needed to do all kinds of things that they hadn’t done before:
00:02:58 set up videoconferencing accounts,
00:03:01 learn how to use new apps like Skype®
00:03:03 and Zoom—what’s that?—
00:03:05 and become familiar with how
00:03:07 to organize an entire congregation meeting online.
00:03:11 It’s been a huge task for our brothers,
00:03:15 and we want to commend them for the excellent job they’re doing.
00:03:20 The elders had a lot of questions, but through his organization,
00:03:24 Jehovah provided the direction they needed.
00:03:27 And an experience from Canada will bring this out.
00:03:31 Let’s watch a video in which Brother Warren Shewfelt,
00:03:35 a member of the Canada Branch Committee,
00:03:37 explains what happened in Canada.
00:03:42 In the face of the coronavirus threat,
00:03:44 a body of elders near the Canada branch
00:03:46 recently met to determine
00:03:48 how to go forward with congregation meetings.
00:03:51 They had so many questions
00:03:54 about how to balance the spiritual needs of the brothers
00:03:56 with government regulations on gatherings.
00:04:00 They prayed to Jehovah for guidance.
00:04:02 But as their meeting went on,
00:04:05 it still wasn’t clear to them how to proceed.
00:04:07 And then one of the brothers noticed on his electronic device
00:04:10 a letter from the branch with instructions to the elders.
00:04:14 As they read through it, it answered all their questions
00:04:17 and even some they hadn’t anticipated.
00:04:20 They viewed this as Jehovah’s answer to their prayers,
00:04:24 but now they had less than 24 hours to prepare
00:04:27 their first-ever congregation meeting by videoconference.
00:04:32 Prayerfully, they followed the instructions step-by-step,
00:04:35 and the next evening, the whole congregation gathered
00:04:39 for a meeting by videoconference.
00:04:41 The attendance was well over 100 percent,
00:04:44 and one of the families who were  in attendance wrote to the elders:
00:04:49 “We are so grateful for all the effort
00:04:53 “to provide this much needed spiritual food live.
00:04:57 “It was exactly what we needed.
00:05:00 Thank you.”
00:05:04 What an encouraging experience that was!
00:05:07 Thanks, Warren. We really appreciate it.
00:05:09 And, you know, it reminds me of what the prophet Isaiah foretold
00:05:13 at Isaiah 65:24:
00:05:16 “Even before they call . . . , I will answer;
00:05:20 while they are yet speaking, I will hear.”
00:05:26 When we think of caring elders, our circuit overseers come to mind
00:05:30 because they’re often a vital link between the branch
00:05:34 and the congregation when disaster strikes.
00:05:37 That reminds me of an experience my wife and I had back in 2010.
00:05:41 I was assigned to do a shepherding visit to Haiti
00:05:44 about 10 days after a tremendous earthquake
00:05:48 took hundreds of thousands of lives.
00:05:50 And sadly, 154 of our brothers also lost their lives.
00:05:55 Well, I met with the traveling overseers in the country,
00:05:59 and I learned that some of them had lost members of their own family.
00:06:04 But they were at the forefront of the rescue effort,
00:06:06 so they hadn’t had time to mourn their own loss.
00:06:10 They were still looking for survivors of the quake.
00:06:13 So, what did Jehovah say?
00:06:16 “I will raise up . . . shepherds who will really shepherd them.
00:06:20 None [of them] will be missing.”
00:06:24 And those shepherds in Haiti were going to make sure
00:06:27 that none of their brothers and sisters were missing.
00:06:32 Do you know that our fine traveling overseers
00:06:34 are continuing to serve congregations
00:06:36 as best they can during this pandemic?
00:06:39 How is that possible?
00:06:41 In this encouraging video report, Brother Paul Echon,
00:06:45 who is a member of the Philippines Branch Committee,
00:06:47 tells how even remote congregations are being cared for.
00:06:51 This is interesting.
00:06:53 Let’s watch.
00:06:57 A circuit overseer in the Philippines
00:06:59 wrote regarding his experience
00:07:01 using the videoconferencing app Zoom
00:07:03 to visit two of the remotest congregations in his circuit.
00:07:07 Normal travel to these islands by small boat
00:07:10 may take between five to eight hours,
00:07:13 depending on sea conditions and the size of waves from the Pacific Ocean.
00:07:17 Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:07:19 travel restrictions to Patnanungan
00:07:21 and Jomalig islands were implemented.
00:07:24 The circuit overseer and his wife
00:07:27 prayed fervently to Jehovah,
00:07:29 asking for a possible means to still visit the congregations
00:07:32 the last two weeks of March.
00:07:35 Just days later, they received a letter from the branch office
00:07:38 about alternative ways of making congregation visits.
00:07:42 This included the possibility of virtual visits
00:07:46 with the use of online conferencing tools.
00:07:49 The circuit overseer immediately informed the elders,
00:07:52 and they excitedly tested their newfound means of communication.
00:07:56 The visits were a success!
00:07:59 The brothers and sisters were so thankful
00:08:01 and really felt Jehovah’s love for them.
00:08:04 Reflecting on his experience, the circuit overseer said:
00:08:08 “It is obvious that no coronavirus
00:08:11 “can prevent our Almighty God, Jehovah,
00:08:14 “from providing encouragement to his servants today.
00:08:17 “We are determined more than ever to help and encourage
00:08:21 “the brothers to continue trusting in Jehovah completely,
00:08:25 “as mentioned at Psalm 91:2, which says:
00:08:27 ‘You are my refuge and my stronghold.’”
00:08:34 What did we read at Jeremiah 23:4?
00:08:37 “None [of them] will be missing.”
00:08:39 Jehovah knows where all his sheep are,
00:08:42 and he arranges for them to be cared for.
00:08:45 Thanks, Paul.
00:08:47 And please give our warm love and greetings
00:08:49 to our brothers in the Philippines.
00:08:50 We love them all very much.
00:08:54 So, what do we want to take away from this brief discussion?
00:08:58 Two points: First, we believe that Jehovah
00:09:03 will continue to guide his organization every step of the way.
00:09:07 And it’s been faith-strengthening to see how, at times,
00:09:10 the organization has been one or even two steps ahead
00:09:13 of the authorities in giving direction to protect the flock.
00:09:16 So that’s the first point:
00:09:18 Jehovah will continue to direct the organization.
00:09:22 Second, what is one of the means by which he will do that?
00:09:26 By providing loving shepherds to carry out that direction.
00:09:31 And over them is the One who said:
00:09:34 “I am the fine shepherd;
00:09:36 “the fine shepherd surrenders his life
00:09:39 in behalf of the sheep.”
00:09:41 Brothers and sisters, take good care of yourselves.
00:09:46 Don’t take chances.
00:09:48 Obey the instructions of “the superior authorities.”
00:09:52 We at Bethel are extremely conscientious
00:09:55 about following the guidelines we’ve received.
00:09:57 So if the authorities tell you to stay home, stay home.
00:10:02 Practice social distancing.
00:10:05 Now, keep up-to-date with the news, but don’t obsess.
00:10:09 Don’t watch it too much.
00:10:10 It can be just too discouraging.
00:10:14 Now, what season are we in?
00:10:16 Memorial season.
00:10:19 So, what should be the real focus of our thoughts at this time?
00:10:23 The incredible gift of the ransom,
00:10:27 the love of Jehovah God, the love of Christ Jesus.
00:10:30 Those things should be the object of our thoughts.
00:10:34 And when you feel alone or stressed-out,
00:10:37 repeat to yourself the heart-cheering words
00:10:40 that we find at Hebrews 13:5:
00:10:43 “I will never leave you,
00:10:46 and I will never abandon you.”
00:10:49 “I will never leave you,
00:10:52 and I will never abandon you.”
00:10:57 Be assured of our warm love and prayers.

00:00:02 They drove up in front of our car
00:00:05 in a Jeep with tinted windows and blocked the road.
00:00:07 Several masked men with automatic weapons
00:00:10 jumped out and shouted, “Don’t move!”
00:00:13 They twisted my arms behind my back
00:00:15 and pushed me up against the hood of my car.
00:00:18 This interview was filmed in July 2019.
00:00:22 Feliks Makhammadiyev described his arrest
00:00:25 and his life in the detention center,
00:00:27 where he spent almost a year.
00:00:29 At that time, no one imagined
00:00:31 that just two months later a court would find him guilty
00:00:33 of organizing extremist activity and imprison him
00:00:38 along with five fellow believers.
00:00:46 In December 2019, the Saratov Regional Court
00:00:50 dismissed the appeal filed by the Witnesses and upheld the verdict.
00:00:55 Early in February, five of the six convicted Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:00 were sent to Penal Colony No. 1 in Orenburg.
00:01:03 Upon their arrival on February 6,
00:01:06 they were beaten by prison guards.
00:01:10 The guards forced them to their knees
00:01:12 and started beating them
00:01:14 with clubs and fists and kicking them.
00:01:17 Feliks was beaten the most,
00:01:19 probably because he was smiling
00:01:20 when they went in
00:01:22 —because he’s always smiling.
00:01:24 Feliks Makhammadiyev was diagnosed with a broken rib
00:01:27 and a damaged lung and kidney.
00:01:36 Aleksey and Tatyana Budenchuk have two young children.
00:01:40 The family lives in a small house,
00:01:43 and their main source of income comes from their small farm.
00:01:47 But on June 12, 2018,
00:01:50 the lives of the entire family suddenly changed when a group
00:01:54 of armed officers raided their home.
00:01:57 I saw that someone wearing a mask and uniform
00:02:00 went into the garage.
00:02:01 A few seconds later, he came up the stairs,
00:02:05 forced me to the floor, and handcuffed me.
00:02:08 Afterward, they took Mom and Dad away.
00:02:12 I was afraid that I might never see them again.
00:02:15 Eventually Tatyana was released,
00:02:19 but two days later, a court sentenced Aleksey to a detention center.
00:02:23 Konstantin Bazhenov and Feliks Makhammadiyev
00:02:25 were sent to the same detention center.
00:02:28 Three other Witnesses were forced to sign a document
00:02:31 agreeing not to leave their city of residence.
00:02:34 I spent a total of 11 months and 8 days in the detention center.
00:02:39 Then, on May 20, 2019, we were released from there
00:02:43 and were placed under a different form
00:02:46 of restriction —a ban on certain activities.
00:02:49 In July 2019, the criminal trial
00:02:53 against the six Witnesses from the city of Saratov began.
00:02:58 The charges read in black and white:
00:03:00 “There are no victims,
00:03:02 no harm whatsoever has been done to anyone.”
00:03:05 An individual should be informed of the accusation against him,
00:03:09 including specific details about the time and location.
00:03:13 But this document reads like this:
00:03:15 “At an undetermined time
00:03:17 “in an undetermined place after a certain date,
00:03:21 “somebody came up with the idea
00:03:23 to create an organization whose activity was banned.”
00:03:29 Eventually all six Witnesses were found guilty
00:03:32 and sentenced to imprisonment from two to three and a half years.
00:03:36 The court decision proved to be a real test
00:03:39 for their friends and relatives.
00:03:42 The wives of the six convicted Witnesses from Saratov
00:03:46 vow to continue to support their husbands
00:03:49 and to never renounce their faith in God.
00:03:53 In July 2019, in an interview given to our film crew,
00:03:56 Feliks Makhammadiyev and Aleksey Budenchuk assured us
00:04:00 that they are not embittered by the criminal prosecution
00:04:03 and that they view any hardships they may have to face
00:04:06 as an opportunity to prove their loyalty to Jehovah.
00:04:10 There were times when it seemed I couldn’t take it anymore,
00:04:14 but every day I prayed to Jehovah that he give me
00:04:18 peace and joy for that day.
00:04:22 I am so proud of him!
00:04:25 Not only did he face the court trial with dignity,
00:04:28 but he continues to bear up with dignity,
00:04:31 and he even helps me to endure.

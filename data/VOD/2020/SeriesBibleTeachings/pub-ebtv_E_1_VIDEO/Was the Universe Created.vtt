The universe is vast and awe-inspiring.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earth and life on it are amazingly complex.

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did it all get here?

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible book of Genesis says
that there is a Creator.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the account is often misunderstood
or even dismissed as a myth.

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is what the Bible says
about the origin of the universe plausible?

00:00:55.993 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scientists estimate that the universe
is 14 billion years old.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This implies that the universe,
including earth, had a beginning.

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible agrees.

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 1:1 reads:

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:19.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth.”

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account does not say
when or how the universe began.

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it focuses

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:29.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the creative process
that took place on earth

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over six periods of time,
which the Bible calls days.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were these six 24-hour days, as many believe?

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Hebrew word used in the Bible for “day”

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can refer to various lengths of time.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis even summarizes

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the six days of creation as one day

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“the day that Jehovah God
made earth and heaven.”

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each “day” in Genesis chapter 1

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have spanned
extremely long periods of time.

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:10.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account’s perspective is also important.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The writer describes the creative periods

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they would have appeared
to an observer on the earth.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:22.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Had someone been there,
he would have seen events

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that started in one period

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then progressed
into the following periods.

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:31.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Light penetrated the atmosphere

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal alternating day and night.

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:38.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earth was covered with water,

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and vapor filled the air.

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dense clouds lifted
from the waters that covered the earth,

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forming an expansive sky between them.

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Water receded to uncover dry ground,

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the first plants appeared.

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:59.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The atmosphere cleared further

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal the sun and the moon.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God created living creatures in the sea

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:08.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and flying creatures above.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the last period,

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God created land animals and humans.

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with the Genesis account,

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says:

00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:30.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Of course, every house
is constructed by someone,

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:34.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who constructed all things is God.”

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible does not speak
in scientific detail,

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but its account of creation
is logical and reasonable.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:49.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also offers
logical and reasonable answers

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to other important questions.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does our planet exist for a purpose?

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the meaning of life?

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the future hold?

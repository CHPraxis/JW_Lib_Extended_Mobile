Jehovah has been so good to us.

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy a busy life full of blessings . . .

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . including one we didn’t expect.

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:48.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our little Emma so much!

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But child-rearing was harder than we thought.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most days went well

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—others, not so much.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just need some rest.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will things be back to normal?

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wake with every little cry!

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:50.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wake when she’s silent.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I doing this right?

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should check on them.

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any time to ourselves was time to do nothing.

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:05.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fatigue was affecting
our relationship with Jehovah . . .

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and each other.

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:27.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so relieved
when David, a father himself,

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered to visit with another elder.

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:37.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Isaiah 40:29:

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He gives power to the tired one

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and full might to those lacking strength.”

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a loving Father,

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants parents to succeed.

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he gives us
what we need to recharge us.

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things might never be like they were before.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his suggestions helped us create

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:02.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a practical and consistent spiritual routine.

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David said it’s normal
for new parents to feel anxious,

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anxiety is tiring.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pray for a calm heart . . .

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and extra kindness when tired,

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can keep working as a team.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I so appreciate Zack’s help.

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:41.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m sacrificing some unnecessary things

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:45.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put spiritual things first.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will always be a lot to do.

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:05.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Emma sleeps,

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feed my faith

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rest.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new spiritual routine is invigorating.

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:37.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Daddy!

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey.

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us to understand.

00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While life in this system
may have many challenges,

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting spiritual things first

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will give us the strength to meet them.

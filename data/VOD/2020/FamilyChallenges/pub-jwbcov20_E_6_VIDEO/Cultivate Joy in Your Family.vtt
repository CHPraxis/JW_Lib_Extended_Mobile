00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was trying to get caught up on paperwork
for the circuit overseer’s visit.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:09.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was so much to do.

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to be kidding me.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re home early, Honey.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sensed something was wrong.

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kids had left a few things out,
and I was a bit preoccupied.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tough day?

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:39.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were supposed to talk
to the girls about this.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re making it a habit.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I thought about it, though,
I realized it wasn’t just the kitchen.

00:00:57.786 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I was part of the problem.

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe the problem was me.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, my wife
is an amazing woman,

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so loving.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be an understatement
to call her industrious.

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there’s her infectious joy.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, how could I not love her?

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes it takes
more than saying, “I love you.”

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Honey, you’re right.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is completely unacceptable.

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to the girls
as soon as they come through that door.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so tired after work

00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but glad to finally get home, until . . .

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to be kidding me.

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re home, Honey.

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew he had congregation stuff
to work on,

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:43.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but seriously?

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tough day?

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:49.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were supposed
to talk to the girls about this.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re making it a habit.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, it upset me
that he didn’t say anything,

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then I began to think.

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:09.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually something I’ve come to love
about John—his patience.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t overreact.

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s thoughtful, concerned.

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He really listens.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:38.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s why he’s such a good elder

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why we’ve enjoyed
so many blessings together.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:04.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I forget,

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could be more patient.

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Honey, you’re right.

00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:17.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is completely unacceptable.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to the girls as soon
as they come through that door.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:30.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Showtime!

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fire drill went off right
when we were having our math test.

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:40.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, Dad!
I’ve got to shower before our study.

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:47.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Girls.

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to finish the kitchen now.

00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:51.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we don’t have any time;
we just got home.

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we have to leave in 15 minutes.

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No discussion, no excuses.
Now!

00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:59.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did tell them to leave
the kitchen spotless, didn’t I?

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:12.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed to hear that.

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:17.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just overall they are . . .

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know. I know.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were auxiliary pioneering
during the circuit overseer’s visit.

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:38.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really put themselves out for others

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:48.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including you—I mean, us.

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:14.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t ever want to take them for granted.

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:18.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, girls,

00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:20.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the big mess earlier,

00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks for cleaning that up.

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mom and I, we were upset.

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:31.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we really want you to know that, um . . .

00:06:31.912 --> 00:06:36.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . you are gifts from Jehovah
—precious gifts we both cherish.

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:39.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What your Mom said.

00:06:52.683 --> 00:06:54.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man, I’m so happy today

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that fire drill
interrupted our math test.

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:58.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to do it tomorrow,

00:06:58.647 --> 00:07:00.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’m going to be studying again all night.

00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:02.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, Dad!
I’ve got to shower before our study.

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No discussion, no excuses.
Now!

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:10.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:16.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did all of this come from?

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:17.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be here all night.

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:28.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did give us time to think.

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:39.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are such good examples.

00:07:48.447 --> 00:07:50.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom never stops working.

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:57.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our home
is always, always beautiful.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:04.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They give us so much of their time

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:08.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and themselves.

00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:12.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a bit cheesy sometimes,

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:15.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but overall, they’re pretty great.

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:20.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night, they didn’t lecture us.

00:08:20.854 --> 00:08:23.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just reminded us of one thing.

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:25.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was pretty deep.

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:30.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah,

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:33.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our lives include everything

00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:37.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our time, our resources, our home,

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:38.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our kitchen.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our kitchen.

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:45.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we care for those things,
it reflects on him

00:08:45.003 --> 00:08:48.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on us as your parents.

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:50.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of sank in.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do better.

00:08:53.929 --> 00:08:56.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Mom.
We got this.

00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:59.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um.
We got this?

00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:01.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah.
We got this.

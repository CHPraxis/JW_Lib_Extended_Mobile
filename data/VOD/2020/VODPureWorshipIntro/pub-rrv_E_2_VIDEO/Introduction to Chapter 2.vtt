‎Abel was an imperfect man, 
born to sinful parents. 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even so,

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when he offered God 
a sacrifice as an act of worship,

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:14.201 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah accepted his gift. 

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
when Abel’s brother Cain offered God a gift,

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah rejected his worship. 

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why?

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read with me Hebrews 11:4:

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.430 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of greater worth than that of Cain,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and through that faith he received 
the witness that he was righteous,

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for God approved his gifts,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and although he died,

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.400 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he still speaks through his faith.” 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That scripture states
the theme for the chapter

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘God Approved’ Their Gifts.” 

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:58.245 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this chapter, we’ll discuss 
four elements that are essential

00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if our worship is to be acceptable to God. 

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:06.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’ll learn 
why Jehovah accepted worship from Abel

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but not from Cain. 

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:11.342 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’ll also consider what we can learn

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:16.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the examples of others 
mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you review the history of pure worship,

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎take time to meditate on the example set

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:28.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by such faithful men 
as Noah, Abraham, and Jacob. 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you do so,

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you will gain a deeper understanding

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of what we need to do to give Jehovah

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.577 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the pure worship he deserves.

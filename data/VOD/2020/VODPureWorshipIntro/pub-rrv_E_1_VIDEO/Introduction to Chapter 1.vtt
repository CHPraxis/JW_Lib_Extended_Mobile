00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:03.315 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, hello. 

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:05.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’re starting a new book together

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with an interesting title:

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Pure Worship of Jehovah—Restored At Last! 

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What spiritual gems will we find in this book? 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Will there be clarifications of understanding? 

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes! 

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Will we see beautiful illustrations 
of vivid prophetic visions? 

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes! 

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Rather than discussing 
the book of Ezekiel verse by verse,

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Pure Worship book 
considers Ezekiel’s prophecy topic by topic. 

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Section 1, which begins with chapter 3,

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎focuses on the celestial chariot. 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The remaining four sections

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎discuss how pure worship was contaminated

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.987 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and restored

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how it will survive attack

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and remain for all time. 

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Each chapter concludes with a box entitled

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Your Place in Pure Worship.” 

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:05.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Take time to meditate 
on the questions in those boxes. 

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:08.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Doing so will increase 
your appreciation for pure worship

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and your place in it. 

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what can we expect in chapter 1?

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:19.767 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are you dealing with a trial in your life? 

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Or is someone tempting you 
to ignore Jehovah’s standards? 

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.106 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If so,

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:31.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can relate to the situation 
that Jesus faced in 29 C.E. 

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan had waited until Jesus was hungry

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.702 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎before approaching him 
with the first of three temptations. 

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What was Satan’s goal? 

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:46.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We learn the answer 
from the way Jesus responded to Satan.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read with me Matthew 4:10:

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:55.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Then Jesus said to him: 
‘Go away, Satan! 

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘For it is written:

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘“It is Jehovah your God 
you must worship,

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:05.854 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it is to him alone 
you must render sacred service.”’”

00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is the theme scripture 
for the chapter entitled

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“It Is Jehovah Your God You Must Worship.” 

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:17.241 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you consider this material, 
look for these points:

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What tactics did Satan use 
in his first two temptations of Jesus,

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:26.291 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how does Satan tempt us in similar ways? 

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.503 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As shown by the third temptation of Jesus,

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what does Satan want from us,

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how can we resist his enticements? 

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How can you demonstrate 
that you agree with the words:

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“It is Jehovah your God you must worship”?

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:46.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Make time to study each chapter. 

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look up the scriptures. 

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Consider how they apply to the material

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.528 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and what they teach you 
about our Father and Creator. 

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:57.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah loves you

00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:02.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and will give you the strength
to deal with any trial or temptation. 

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One way he does so 
is through his Word, the Bible. 

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The better you understand Bible principles,

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the greater will be your desire 
to reject Satan’s traps

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to give Jehovah exclusive, pure worship. 

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Enjoy the study!

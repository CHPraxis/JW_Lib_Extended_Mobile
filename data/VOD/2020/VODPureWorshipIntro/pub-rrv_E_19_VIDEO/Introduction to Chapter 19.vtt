‎A river that brings life wherever it goes,

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:09.321 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a land that’s divided
so that each inhabitant

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.950 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎has equal access to its bounties,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.286 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎an earthly seat of administration

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that governs 
according to Jehovah’s loving ways

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:23.335 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—these thrilling truths 
and more are discussed

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:27.673 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the final section 
of the Pure Worship book. 

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Based on Ezekiel 43:7,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the title of section 5 is

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will Dwell Among the People.”

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the first chapter of this section,

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’ll learn about the remarkable river

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.107 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Ezekiel saw in his temple vision.

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The title of the chapter is

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.281 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Everything Will Live 
Wherever the Stream Goes.” 

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That title is drawn from Ezekiel 47:9. 

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read it with me:

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Swarms of living creatures

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“will be able to live 
wherever the waters flow. 

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“There will be an abundance of fish,

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“because this water will flow there. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The seawater will be healed,

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and everything will live 
wherever the stream goes.” 

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter,

‎try to answer these questions:

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How was Ezekiel’s vision of the river

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.775 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎fulfilled in ancient times? 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In what ways are we seeing

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a fulfillment of that vision today? 

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How will Ezekiel’s visionary river flow

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the greatest sense 
during Christ’s Millennial Reign?

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do you enjoy picturing yourself

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and your loved ones in Paradise?

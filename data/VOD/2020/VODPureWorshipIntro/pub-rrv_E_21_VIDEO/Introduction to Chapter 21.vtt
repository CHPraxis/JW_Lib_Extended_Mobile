‎In the chapter we just completed,

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:07.027 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we learned how 
Ezekiel’s final vision assures us

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:09.905 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we all have a secure place

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:14.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and a valuable assignment
in the spiritual paradise. 

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this chapter 
of the Pure Worship book,

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’ll see how 
that same vision provides us

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with further heartwarming assurance.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 21 is entitled

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Name of the City . . . 
Will Be Jehovah Is There,”

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎taken from Ezekiel 48:35. 

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read it with me:

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The perimeter will be 18,000 cubits. 

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And the name of the city 
from that day on will be

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah Is There.” 

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter,

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for the answers to these questions:

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What does this visionary city represent,

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and what lesson 
can we learn from its name? 

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What important reminder

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎does this vision have for elders? 

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What can we learn 
from Ezekiel’s description

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:13.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of all the activities 
in and around the city gates? 

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What larger fulfillment

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will Ezekiel’s vision have in the future?

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May this chapter,

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which will complete 
our discussion of Ezekiel’s final vision,

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎assure you of this unassailable truth:

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah is and always will be

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with his pure worshippers!

‎Have you ever wondered
how Jehovah views you?

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some of our dear brothers and sisters

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎struggle with feelings of unworthiness. 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s important for us 
to know that Jehovah God

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.161 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎loves and values each of his worshippers,

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and this includes you.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.833 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 20 of the Pure Worship book

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎discusses the heartwarming encouragement

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we can receive from Ezekiel’s last vision. 

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The title is 
“Allot the Land as an Inheritance,”

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎based on Ezekiel 45:1. 

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read that with me:

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“When you allot
the land as an inheritance,

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“you should offer
as a contribution to Jehovah

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“a holy portion out of the land. 

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Its length should be 25,000 cubits,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and its width, 10,000 cubits. 

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:54.700 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Its entire area will be a holy portion.” 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter,
you will learn this reassuring lesson:

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No matter how modest our responsibility

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the earthly part 
of God’s organization may be,

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎each of us has a secure place
in the spiritual paradise.

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How loving of Jehovah

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to give Ezekiel a vision that’s filled 

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:16.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with such encouragement and assurance! 

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May this chapter help you 
to become fully convinced

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that you are precious to Jehovah

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that he values all 
that you do in his service.

00:00:01 Our focus in the Watchtower study article
00:00:03 is on how we can unleash
00:00:05 the power of God’s Word
00:00:07 when teaching from the platform.
00:00:10 But, you know, whether we’re teaching
00:00:12 in a congregation setting,
00:00:14 on a Bible study, or in the family,
00:00:16 isn’t it true that all of us, brothers and sisters,
00:00:19 need to ‘pay constant attention to ourselves and to our teaching’?
00:00:23 And we know why that’s so important —because lives are at stake.
00:00:28 And all of us, younger or older,
00:00:32 touch the lives of other people.
00:00:34 So when we teach effectively,
00:00:36 we are giving opportunity to others
00:00:39 to attain the wisdom and the discernment that God’s Word can give them.
00:00:43 That’s why we need to approach any teaching opportunity
00:00:47 seriously and prayerfully.
00:00:50 Over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me
00:00:53 some constructive counsel after a public talk.
00:00:56 And then, with a warm smile, he said this,
00:00:59 “Remember, none of us teach like Jesus did.”
00:01:04 Well, I’ll never forget that counsel.
00:01:06 Why were those observations so helpful?
00:01:10 Well, it reminded me that when teaching,
00:01:12 our model needs to be Jesus, the Great Teacher.
00:01:16 There’s more to learn from him.
00:01:19 And Jesus’ example reminds us of the need
00:01:21 to remain humble and diligent students of Jehovah
00:01:26 —the Grand Instructor.
00:01:29 Though all of us are teachers on occasion,
00:01:33 isn’t it true that most often
00:01:35 the role we play during spiritual programs
00:01:38 is that of students?
00:01:41 Just for a moment, think about the many hours
00:01:44 we spend as students —not teachers—
00:01:48 when we’re in the audience at congregation meetings,
00:01:52 at assemblies, and at conventions.
00:01:54 Add to that the time we are students
00:01:58 when we buy out time to watch the monthly broadcast,
00:02:01 to prepare for meetings, to engage in family and personal study.
00:02:06 And then think of the added privilege that many of us here have
00:02:09 —to enjoy morning worship five days a week.
00:02:14 You know, a typical program of morning worship
00:02:16 lasts between 20 to 25 minutes.
00:02:18 If you multiply that by 5 days a week and then by 52 weeks,
00:02:23 at a minimum, we are exposed
00:02:26 to at least 86 hours
00:02:29 of divine instruction each year.
00:02:32 But if we’re not careful,
00:02:34 some or much of that valuable instruction,
00:02:37 encouragement, and counsel could just wash over us.
00:02:42 So for the remaining time for our program this morning,
00:02:44 let’s consider some things all of us can do
00:02:47 to listen more effectively
00:02:50 at spiritual programs.
00:02:52 Please, for our first point, open your Bible
00:02:54 to Ezra 7:10,
00:02:58 and let’s consider Ezra’s example.
00:03:01 That’s Ezra 7:10,
00:03:06 and notice the reading carefully:
00:03:08 “Ezra had prepared his heart
00:03:11 “to consult the Law of Jehovah
00:03:14 “and to practice it,
00:03:16 “and to teach its regulations
00:03:18 and judgments in Israel.”
00:03:21 Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk
00:03:24 next to “prepared his heart,”
00:03:26 if you tap on that, you’ll notice that that could be rendered as
00:03:30 “had determined in his heart.”
00:03:34 Well, what do we learn from Ezra?
00:03:36 He had the right attitude going into a period of study.
00:03:40 He had the right approach to study and learning.
00:03:44 He recognized that it was Jehovah
00:03:46 who would be teaching him through His Law.
00:03:49 And as the verse goes on to say, he first recognized
00:03:53 that he needed to personally practice what he was learning.
00:03:57 Only then would he be in a rightful position
00:04:01 to effectively teach others.
00:04:03 Well, this scripture emphasizes the point we’ve already made, doesn’t it?
00:04:07 Though we are teachers on occasion,
00:04:10 we are always first and foremost
00:04:13 students of God’s Word.
00:04:16 How can we imitate Ezra’s example
00:04:18 and prepare our hearts before study,
00:04:22 before attending a spiritual program
00:04:24 (whether here at Bethel or in the congregation),
00:04:27 before watching a monthly broadcast?
00:04:31 Well, we need to prepare our hearts by specifically praying to Jehovah,
00:04:36 recognizing him as the Source of the teaching.
00:04:40 What should we pray specifically about?
00:04:43 Well, for one, we want to pray that we remain humble
00:04:48 while listening to theocratic instruction.
00:04:51 We need to listen
00:04:53 —no matter how long we’ve been in Jehovah’s classroom—
00:04:56 because none of us know it all,
00:04:59 nor will we ever know it all.
00:05:01 Proverbs 1:5 reminds us
00:05:03 that “a wise person listens and takes in more instruction.”
00:05:09 Well, this leads to another question:
00:05:11 What if we find we have a somewhat negative attitude
00:05:14 toward a certain presentation
00:05:16 —perhaps the material doesn’t interest us,
00:05:20 or we have a negative attitude toward a certain brother
00:05:23 and his teaching ability?
00:05:25 What should we do?
00:05:27 Prepare our heart.
00:05:29 Pray to Jehovah to recognize and appreciate
00:05:34 that the instruction is from him.
00:05:37 Pray to have a thankful spirit.
00:05:40 You know, back in 2002, The Watchtower  made this helpful point
00:05:44 in an article that was entitled “Pay More Than the Usual Attention.”
00:05:47 I quote: “Some may tend to gauge the quality of a meeting
00:05:52 “by the teaching abilities of the participants. . . .
00:05:55 “Though the teaching ability of participants is important,
00:05:58 “it is not the sole factor contributing to a meeting’s success.
00:06:02 “Do you not agree that our prime concern should be,
00:06:05 “not how well the speaker delivers his talk,
00:06:08 “but how well we incline our ear?
00:06:12 When we attend meetings,” the article continues,
00:06:15 “and pay attention to what is being presented,
00:06:18 “we are worshiping God in harmony with his will.
00:06:21 “That is what makes the meeting a success.
00:06:24 “If we are eager to take in the knowledge of God,
00:06:26 “we will benefit from meetings,
00:06:28 regardless of a speaker’s abilities.”
00:06:32 What a beautiful reminder for all of us!
00:06:34 So our first point: Like Ezra,
00:06:37 let’s prepare our hearts with prayer,
00:06:40 as students who are determined to always
00:06:44 accept and apply what Jehovah has to teach us.
00:06:49 Let’s consider a second point:
00:06:51 the need to focus our attention.
00:06:54 Have you faced the challenge of staying focused
00:06:57 during spiritual programs?
00:06:59 Our minds may be distracted
00:07:02 with anxieties and many other things.
00:07:05 Noise and movements around us could distract us.
00:07:09 If we’re watching morning worship
00:07:11 at a location other than the Bethel dining room,
00:07:13 likely we well know the numerous distractions
00:07:17 that fight for our attention.
00:07:20 Some of us have ailments and physical discomforts
00:07:22 that may make it difficult to concentrate.
00:07:25 Recently, a sister in our congregation
00:07:28 told us about her long-term battle with migraine headaches.
00:07:32 I tried to put myself in her shoes,
00:07:35 having a migraine headache while attending a spiritual program
00:07:39 —difficult to concentrate.
00:07:42 Well, whatever the case may be, we know —we admit—
00:07:44 that there are many challenges and distractions.
00:07:46 What can we do about it?
00:07:48 Well, since the eyes strongly influence
00:07:51 where we focus our attention,
00:07:54 the Benefit  book provides this suggestion:
00:07:56 “Use your eyes to help you concentrate by keeping them on the speaker.
00:08:01 “When he cites a Bible text —even a familiar one—
00:08:04 look it up, and follow along as he reads it.”
00:08:07 And then it said this: “Resist the temptation to turn your head
00:08:10 “in the direction of every noise or movement.
00:08:13 “If the eyes are flooding your mind with distracting information,
00:08:17 you will miss much of what is presented from the platform.”
00:08:21 And think about, too, the use of electronic devices.
00:08:26 Have you ever been alerted, messaged, or e-mailed
00:08:30 while looking at the Bible on your device?
00:08:34 How wise it is when we turn those devices to a mode
00:08:38 that eliminates unnecessary distractions!
00:08:42 Well, what about anxieties or disquieting thoughts?
00:08:46 What could we do about that?
00:08:48 Well, here, again, is where we can remember
00:08:51 who the Grand Instructor is and how close he can be to us
00:08:55 when we’re in a teaching environment.
00:08:58 Open, please, your Bible to Psalm 94:19
00:09:02 to recall what the psalmist said to Jehovah.
00:09:05 At Psalm 94:19,
00:09:12 we read:
00:09:14 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:09:16 you [Jehovah] comforted and soothed me.”
00:09:21 What a beautiful reminder!
00:09:23 Jehovah can soothe and comfort us
00:09:26 when attending spiritual programs
00:09:28 so that we can focus on what he’s teaching us.
00:09:32 Yes, spiritual programs are a provision from him
00:09:34 —a spiritual lifeline.
00:09:37 So as needed during a spiritual program,
00:09:40 we should pray to Jehovah to help us stay focused.
00:09:43 Pray repeatedly as needed.
00:09:47 Well, in summary, what have we learned?
00:09:49 All of us are teachers from time to time,
00:09:52 but first and foremost, we are students
00:09:56 in the classroom of the Great Teacher and the Grand Instructor.
00:10:00 Like Ezra, humility and appreciation
00:10:03 should move us to ‘prepare our hearts’ before every spiritual program.
00:10:07 We don’t want to miss anything
00:10:10 that Jehovah has for us.
00:10:13 We’re determined ‘to consult that Law
00:10:15 so that we can practice it and then teach it.’
00:10:18 And in view of all the potential distractions,
00:10:21 let’s make it our aim to use our eyes, our mind, and our heart
00:10:25 to focus attention on the goodness of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions.

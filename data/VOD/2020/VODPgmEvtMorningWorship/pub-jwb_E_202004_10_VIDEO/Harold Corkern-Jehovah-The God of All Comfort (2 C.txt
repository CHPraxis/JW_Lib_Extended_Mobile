00:00:01 At 2 Corinthians 1:3,
00:00:04 Jehovah is described
00:00:05 as “the God of all comfort”
00:00:08 and God of “tender mercies.”
00:00:11 And what is the Biblical understanding
00:00:13 of the word “comfort” in this context?
00:00:16 It literally means “a calling to one’s side,”
00:00:20 standing beside a person
00:00:22 to encourage him when he is going through a very difficult time.
00:00:27 One Bible scholar described comfort this way:
00:00:30 “The word . . . always means far more than soothing sympathy.”
00:00:34 The Christian comfort is that which brings courage
00:00:37 and enables a man to cope with all that life can do to him.
00:00:42 That describes Jehovah, doesn’t it?
00:00:46 He’s also called “the Father of tender mercies,”
00:00:48 and that expression “tender mercies” means to “feel pity”
00:00:52 and “cares very much.”
00:00:56 Jehovah is the source
00:00:58 of heartfelt pity and care.
00:01:02 Now, just to illustrate that,
00:01:04 let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 23 and look at verse 1.
00:01:09 Notice how Jehovah is always there standing beside us
00:01:12 as a caring Shepherd.
00:01:15 Psalm 23:1 says: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.
00:01:19 I will lack nothing.”
00:01:23 So whatever life throws at us
00:01:25 —in line with a word of comfort—
00:01:27 Jehovah, as our caring Shepherd, will provide what we need.
00:01:32 And this expression “shepherd” is very fitting
00:01:36 because a Middle Eastern shepherd cared deeply for his sheep.
00:01:40 He would inspect them every day.
00:01:42 He knew their names,
00:01:44 and if he saw any indication of sickness or pain,
00:01:49 he would treat them right away.
00:01:51 He would give them medicine if it was needed.
00:01:53 And if they were too weak to stand up while they were recovering,
00:01:56 he would actually (literally) hold them up
00:01:59 so that they would not lie down and die and give up.
00:02:03 Well, Jehovah is there for us, isn’t he?
00:02:06 When we go through difficulties and we just feel like lying down,
00:02:10 he’s there to carry the load for us and to prop us up as a caring Shepherd.
00:02:15 This concept of having what we need
00:02:18 is also highlighted
00:02:21 at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.
00:02:25 Paul, under inspiration, is talking about the inspired Scriptures
00:02:29 and how beneficial they are.
00:02:31 And what is the result of one taking advantage of the comfort
00:02:35 Jehovah gives through the Scriptures?
00:02:38 It says: “So that the man of God may be fully competent,
00:02:43 completely equipped for every good work.”
00:02:46 And we might add, not only “every good work”
00:02:49 but everything that life may bring upon us.
00:02:53 That expression “completely equipped” literally means “having been fitted out,”
00:02:59 and sometimes it was used to describe a boat
00:03:02 that was completely outfitted with everything
00:03:05 that was needed for a successful voyage,
00:03:08 or it may refer to a machine
00:03:11 that was always able to live up to what it was designed to do.
00:03:16 So Jehovah always gives us what we need
00:03:19 regardless of the nature of the stress or strain.
00:03:24 Now, just to use one illustration of how Jehovah’s Word can help us,
00:03:29 it’s like Jehovah is standing by us to prop us up.
00:03:33 Let’s talk about something that can be very emotionally draining
00:03:36 and very difficult to deal with, and that’s loneliness.
00:03:41 Loneliness is a longing to be loved by someone,
00:03:45 to be understood, to feel needed, wanted, appreciated.
00:03:50 And when those things are not met, a person can feel very empty inside.
00:03:56 Now, being alone is not the same as loneliness, is it?
00:04:02 Being alone is a state of a geographic situation.
00:04:07 Loneliness is an emotional condition,
00:04:10 because some of the loneliest people in the world
00:04:14 are surrounded by millions in large cities.
00:04:17 So it’s not just having people around;
00:04:19 there has to be a connection there;
00:04:22 there has to be more than just people.
00:04:24 Well, notice the words of Psalm 68:6
00:04:29 that show what Jehovah does
00:04:32 for those who may be experiencing loneliness.
00:04:35 The first part of Psalm 68:6 says:
00:04:39 “God gives those who are alone
00:04:43 a home to dwell in.”
00:04:45 Now we notice here, he didn’t say that in this case
00:04:49 he gives him a house, a shelter, a cover.
00:04:52 It’s true Jehovah does that.
00:04:54 But a home conveys much more, doesn’t it?
00:04:57 A home is a place where we have family members
00:05:00 that get along, work together, play together.
00:05:02 There is a united sense of belonging.
00:05:05 They feel needed, wanted, and appreciated
00:05:07 when there’s a happy family life,
00:05:10 and these joyful relationships
00:05:13 become the cure to loneliness.
00:05:16 Now just to illustrate that point,
00:05:18 one of our sisters who was reported on in our public edition
00:05:22 of The Watchtower, No. 1 2018,
00:05:25 had suffered many losses, and she said she felt very alone.
00:05:30 But then she considered the very text we’ve just read at Psalm 68:6,
00:05:35 and notice what she said:
00:05:38 “I knew that the verse could not just mean
00:05:41 “a home in a physical sense now.
00:05:43 “Rather, I came to understand  that God offers us a spiritual home,
00:05:48 “a place of real safety that provides genuine connections
00:05:51 and emotional attachment to others who love Jehovah.”
00:05:55 So Jehovah gave her a home, not just a house.
00:06:00 He gave her a home with relationships and people that cared about her.
00:06:05 And she felt less lonely.
00:06:07 But Jehovah provides that, doesn’t he?
00:06:10 Now in line with that same thought, let’s open our Bibles to Mark chapter 10
00:06:14 —Mark chapter 10—
00:06:16 and we’ll again see the difference between a house and relationships.
00:06:21 In Mark chapter 10,
00:06:23 Jesus is talking about this matter
00:06:26 of a person leaving possessions,
00:06:30 houses, and family for the sake of the good news.
00:06:35 So, what does he say about that?
00:06:38 Well, in verse 29 he says this of Mark 10:
00:06:42 “Truly I say to you, no one [who] has left house
00:06:46 “or brothers or sisters
00:06:49 or mother or father or children.”
00:06:53 So he distinguishes between a house and relationships.
00:06:59 And he says that in imitation of his Father, he’s going to make sure that those
00:07:03 who become isolated or give up things— What are they going to get?
00:07:07 Verse 30: ‘A hundred times more now
00:07:10 ‘—[not just in a house but]
00:07:12 brothers, sisters, mothers, children.’
00:07:16 The loneliness factor is addressed
00:07:19 within the arrangements and provisions
00:07:21 that come from serving Jehovah and being a disciple of Christ.
00:07:26 So how good it is for us to remember that we can imitate Jehovah!
00:07:30 And even though we are surrounded by many people here
00:07:33 in our Bethel family and in our other assignments,
00:07:36 we always want to make sure that it’s not just about being around a lot of people.
00:07:40 But we’re doing what we can, like Jehovah, to stand beside,
00:07:44 comfort, show that we really care,
00:07:46 and help them to get away from any feelings of loneliness
00:07:50 that they may be experiencing.
00:07:53 Well, one caution we’d like to mention in conclusion
00:07:56 of our little discussion this morning
00:07:58 is the fact that we have to be careful
00:08:01 that we don’t default to false comforters.
00:08:05 We have the best comforters, don’t we?
00:08:07 We have Jehovah; we have Christ Jesus; we have a loving brotherhood.
00:08:12 But sometimes when a person is going through stress or loneliness or other trials,
00:08:17 false comforters can make matters worse.
00:08:21 Remember how Job described his so-called friends
00:08:24 who came to comfort him in all of his trials?
00:08:27 At Job 16:2 he said:
00:08:29 “All of you are troublesome comforters!”
00:08:33 And at Job 13:4 he said:
00:08:35 “You are useless physicians.”
00:08:37 They weren’t helping a bit.
00:08:39 In fact, they made his situation worse
00:08:41 because of the things they said.
00:08:44 And their attitude toward Job
00:08:46 brought out some of the not-so-good points in Job.
00:08:49 They made his situation worse.
00:08:52 Well, what could be like a false comforter today
00:08:56 —useless, troublesome?
00:08:59 Well, sometimes people will turn to an escape route.
00:09:04 If they’re not careful,
00:09:06 they’ll turn to a false comforter in the form of overindulgence
00:09:09 or the misuse (the immoderate use) of alcohol,
00:09:14 trying to just escape what they may be feeling or experiencing.
00:09:18 Sometimes people will escape by means of fantasizing about things
00:09:23 that are totally improper,
00:09:25 thinking they’ll escape and get some relief.
00:09:27 But it makes things worse, doesn’t it?
00:09:30 Or a person may be discouraged
00:09:33 and resort to some weakness of the flesh,
00:09:36 thinking that a temporary moment of pleasure
00:09:39 might make them feel better.
00:09:41 But all of those things are not true comforters, are they?
00:09:45 They make matters worse.
00:09:46 They create the need for more comforters.
00:09:49 So in imitation of Jehovah,
00:09:52 may we do what we can to comfort others.
00:09:54 But may we always remember that our comforter is our loving Creator,
00:09:58 “the Father of tender mercies  and the God of all comfort,”
00:10:01 who helps us to cope with whatever life throws at us.

At 2 Corinthians 1:3,

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:05.901 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is described

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as “the God of all comfort”

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:11.240 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and God of “tender mercies.”

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.534 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And what is the Biblical understanding

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the word “comfort” in this context?

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It literally means
“a calling to one’s side,”

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing beside a person

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage him when
he is going through a very difficult time.

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible scholar described
comfort this way: 

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word . . . always means
far more than soothing sympathy.”

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Christian comfort
is that which brings courage

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enables a man to cope
with all that life can do to him.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That describes Jehovah, doesn’t it?

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s also called
“the Father of tender mercies,”

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that expression
“tender mercies” means to “feel pity”

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “cares very much.”

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the source

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of heartfelt pity and care.

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just to illustrate that,

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 23
and look at verse 1.

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jehovah
is always there standing beside us

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a caring Shepherd.

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 23:1 says:
“Jehovah is my Shepherd.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will lack nothing.”

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever life throws at us

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in line with a word of comfort—

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, as our caring Shepherd,
will provide what we need.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:36.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this expression
“shepherd” is very fitting

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because a Middle Eastern shepherd
cared deeply for his sheep.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would inspect them every day.

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:44.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew their names,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if he saw any indication
of sickness or pain,

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would treat them right away.

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would give them medicine if it was needed.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they were too weak
to stand up while they were recovering,

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would actually (literally) hold them up

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they would not lie down
and die and give up.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah is there for us, isn’t he?

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we go through difficulties
and we just feel like lying down,

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s there to carry the load for us
and to prop us up as a caring Shepherd.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This concept of having what we need

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:21.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also highlighted

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:25.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul, under inspiration,
is talking about the inspired Scriptures

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how beneficial they are.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the result
of one taking advantage of the comfort

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives through the Scriptures?

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:43.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “So that the man of God
may be fully competent,

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:49.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we might add, not only “every good work”

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything that life may bring upon us.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That expression “completely equipped”
literally means “having been fitted out,”

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes it was used to describe a boat

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:05.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was completely outfitted with everything

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was needed for a successful voyage,

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it may refer to a machine

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was always able
to live up to what it was designed to do.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:19.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah always gives us what we need 

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of the nature
of the stress or strain.

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just to use one illustration
of how Jehovah’s Word can help us,

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like Jehovah is standing by us
to prop us up.

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about something
that can be very emotionally draining

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and very difficult to deal with,
and that’s loneliness.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loneliness is a longing
to be loved by someone,

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be understood,
to feel needed, wanted, appreciated.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when those things are not met,
a person can feel very empty inside.

00:03:56.632 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, being alone
is not the same as loneliness, is it?

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being alone is a state
of a geographic situation.

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loneliness is an emotional condition,

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:14.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because some
of the loneliest people in the world

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:17.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are surrounded by millions in large cities.

00:04:17.402 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not just having people around;

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:22.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there has to be a connection there;

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there has to be more than just people.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:29.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice the words of Psalm 68:6

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that show what Jehovah does

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who may be experiencing loneliness.

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first part of Psalm 68:6 says:

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:43.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God gives those who are alone

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a home to dwell in.”

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:49.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we notice here,
he didn’t say that in this case

00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:52.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gives him a house, a shelter, a cover.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true Jehovah does that.

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:57.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a home conveys much more, doesn’t it?

00:04:57.442 --> 00:05:00.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A home is a place where
we have family members

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that get along, work together, play together.

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:05.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a united sense of belonging.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel needed, wanted, and appreciated

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there’s a happy family life,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these joyful relationships

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become the cure to loneliness.

00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now just to illustrate that point,

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of our sisters who
was reported on in our public edition

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>The Watchtower, </i>No. 1 2018,

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:30.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had suffered many losses,
and she said she felt very alone.

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then she considered
the very text we’ve just read at Psalm 68:6,

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what she said:

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:41.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I knew that the verse could not just mean

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:43.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a home in a physical sense now.

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:48.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, I came to understand
 that God offers us a spiritual home,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a place of real safety
that provides genuine connections

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and emotional attachment
to others who love Jehovah.”

00:05:55.667 --> 00:06:00.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah gave her a home, not just a house.

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:05.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave her a home with relationships
and people that cared about her.

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she felt less lonely.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah provides that, doesn’t he?

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:14.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in line with that same thought,
let’s open our Bibles to Mark chapter 10

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:16.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mark chapter 10—

00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll again see the difference
between a house and relationships.

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Mark chapter 10,

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is talking about this matter

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:30.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a person leaving possessions,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
houses, and family
for the sake of the good news.

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:38.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does he say about that?

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:42.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 29 he says this of Mark 10:

00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:46.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Truly I say to you,
no one [who] has left house

00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:49.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or brothers or sisters

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:53.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or mother or father or children.”

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:58.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he distinguishes
between a house and relationships.

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he says that in imitation of his Father,
he’s going to make sure that those

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:07.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who become isolated or give up things—
What are they going to get?

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:10.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 30: ‘A hundred times more now

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—[not just in a house but]

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers, sisters, mothers, children.’

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The loneliness factor is addressed

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the arrangements and provisions

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:26.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come from serving Jehovah
and being a disciple of Christ.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:30.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how good it is for us to remember
that we can imitate Jehovah!

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we are surrounded
by many people here

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our Bethel family
and in our other assignments,

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we always want to make sure that it’s
not just about being around a lot of people.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re doing what we can,
like Jehovah, to stand beside,

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:46.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comfort, show that we really care,

00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:50.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help them to get away
from any feelings of loneliness

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they may be experiencing.

00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one caution
we’d like to mention in conclusion

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:58.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our little discussion this morning

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:01.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the fact that we have to be careful

00:08:01.376 --> 00:08:05.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t default to false comforters.

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the best comforters, don’t we?

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have Jehovah; we have Christ Jesus;
we have a loving brotherhood.

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:16.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes when a person is going
through stress or loneliness or other trials,

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:21.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
false comforters can make matters worse.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember how Job
described his so-called friends

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who came to comfort him in all of his trials?

00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:29.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 16:2 he said:

00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:33.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All of you are troublesome comforters!”

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at Job 13:4 he said:

00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:37.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are useless physicians.”

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t helping a bit.

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they made his situation worse

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:44.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the things they said.

00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:46.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their attitude toward Job

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:49.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought out some
of the not-so-good points in Job.

00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:52.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made his situation worse.

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:56.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what could be
like a false comforter today

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—useless, troublesome?

00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:02.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes people
will turn to an escape route.

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re not careful,

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:09.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll turn to a false comforter
in the form of overindulgence

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:14.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the misuse
(the immoderate use) of alcohol,

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:18.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to just escape
what they may be feeling or experiencing.

00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:23.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes people will escape
by means of fantasizing about things

00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:25.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are totally improper,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking they’ll escape and get some relief.

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:30.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it makes things worse, doesn’t it?

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or a person may be discouraged

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and resort to some weakness of the flesh,

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that a temporary moment of pleasure

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:41.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might make them feel better.

00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all of those things
are not true comforters, are they?

00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:46.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make matters worse.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:49.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They create the need for more comforters.

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:52.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in imitation of Jehovah,

00:09:52.404 --> 00:09:54.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we do what we can to comfort others.

00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:58.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But may we always remember
that our comforter is our loving Creator,

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of tender mercies
 and the God of all comfort,”

00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:05.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helps us to cope
with whatever life throws at us.

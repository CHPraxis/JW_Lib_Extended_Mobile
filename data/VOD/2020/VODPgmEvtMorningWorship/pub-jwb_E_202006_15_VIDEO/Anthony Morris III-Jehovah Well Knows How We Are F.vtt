00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the scripture—
Jehovah, of course, is our Creator,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so “he well knows how we are formed.”

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:08.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But this expression,

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:11.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“remembering that we are dust,”

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:14.764 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in no way is intended to demean us

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.867 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or strip us of dignity.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is considerate

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:23.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we’re male or female.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t say, “You don’t understand”

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:29.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as our Creator, he does understand

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s considerate of us.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you think about these times
we’re living in;

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it affects God’s people as well.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the pandemic causing people,
according to some reports,

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:45.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have even their dreams affected.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you think of how busy we are.

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:52.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is doing their best
to give direction to other branches,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
specific direction,

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
related to their particular circumstances.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you could get involved

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just focusing on all of these problems.

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this morning, I’ve chosen
to focus on the future,

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I believe that’s what Jehovah
would want us to do.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:14.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s face reality, but focus on the future.

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by doing that, we’re really benefiting

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the counsel in Isaiah chapter 48

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 48—
a very familiar verse

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:28.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we want to take to heart.

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:32.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17:

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:38.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.’”

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what a beautiful thought!

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah teaches us

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s not selfish on our part

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to benefit ourselves,
or to do what’s “for [our] own good,”

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the footnote brings out.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is for our own good when it comes

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:07.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to these critical last days
we’re dealing with?

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:11.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s best we focus on the future

00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—know what’s going on.

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get the good reports
from the Governing Body

00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the Branch Committee
here in the United States,

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:21.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Canada is doing the same.

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:25.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, it’s good to focus on the future,

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if you start to feel
anxious about circumstances.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what I thought I’d share
with you are some comments

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the <i>Pure Worship</i>  book.

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a gift that was
for all of Jehovah’s people!

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of these comments

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are coming from chapter 9,

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:47.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paragraphs 35 and 36,

00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’ll help us to focus on the future.

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some thoughts:

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:57.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We inhabit a restored spiritual land,

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a condition, or environment,
wherein we serve productively

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make his sacred service
the center of our lives.”

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:10.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how true that is
of the Bethel families around the globe!

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sacred service is the center of our lives.

00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:17.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what, though, about the future?

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what we want to focus on.

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:23.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer: “After . . .  Armageddon,

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus will expand his restoration work

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to cover even the physical earth. . . .

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:32.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will direct mankind to turn this planet

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into a global garden of Eden, a paradise,

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Jehovah always intended it to be!”

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:44.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, beautiful thoughts.

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during these difficult last days,

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to encourage you to meditate

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on these matters that Jehovah
has promised for the future.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s definitely going to be
a time in the future

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:02.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there’ll be no one in danger,

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:07.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no threat of any harm
—including viruses.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to help us with that,
there’s a scripture

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to bring to your attention;

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:17.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not commonly used but, boy,
does it make the point.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:21.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found in Ezekiel chapter 34

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ezekiel chapter 34—

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:31.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 25.

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:35.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the promise:

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:38.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will make a covenant
of peace with them,

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will rid the land
of vicious wild beasts,

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they may dwell securely
in the wilderness

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sleep in the forests.”

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:51.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you picture that

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a land free of vicious wild beasts

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sleeping in the forest?

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what Jehovah promises.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you picture that?

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:06.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our hardworking Art Department
has helped us a lot.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this beautiful piece of artwork

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found in the <i>Pure Worship</i>  book.

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:14.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you have to—
With the larger one

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a television screen,
you see it easier sometimes.

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look at this picture,
and you have the fireflies there

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going around, full moon.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s beautiful.

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a larger picture,
you’re not going to miss

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what so many could miss by not focusing

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:35.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the beautiful picture here

00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the details in it,
because up above her now—

00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:43.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see her sleeping securely
(young sister here),

00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the trees right above her head—

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:47.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see what’s right above there?

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look carefully, there it is
—a leopard.

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:54.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this could be missed so easily,

00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:57.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the book we have,

00:05:57.473 --> 00:06:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see his left arm is hanging there.

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:02.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Male or female?

00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:04.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know for sure.

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:06.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s a leopard,

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:08.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s sleeping.

00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s sleeping.

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:15.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could just hear some
of the sounds of other insects

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:18.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might be in the forest here

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—secure.

00:06:20.863 --> 00:06:22.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing!

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then over to the right of the picture,

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we look at it, see the owl?

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a worry at all.

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, looking at the leopard,
what’s he thinking?

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, animals don’t think like humans.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’s saying,
‘Boy, there he is already asleep again.’

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But everybody is secure.

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s going to happen in the future.

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises it.

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:55.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how grateful we are
for this beautiful piece of artwork!

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let that just absorb every cell in your body;

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
absorb that beautiful thought;
meditate on it,

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially as there are so many
that love the outdoors.

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:11.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others that maybe grew up in cities
are going to learn to love it.

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I’ll assure you of.

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s the future
Jehovah has for his people.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate on it.

00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we entreat you to focus on the future,

00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more opposition is coming.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s face the facts;

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are issues
that we’re going to have to deal with.

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll just wait and see.

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, don’t focus on the problems;
deal with it;

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
follow the direction from the organization.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are “critical times.”

They are “hard to deal with,”

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but focus
on Jehovah’s promises for the future.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The benefit there—
Finally, let’s read Hebrews chapter 6

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews chapter 6.

00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:02.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The counsel directly applies to the anointed
—those with the heavenly hope.

00:08:02.532 --> 00:08:07.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by extension,
all of you with the hope of living forever

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that beautiful paradise earth
that Christ Jesus will bring about,

00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(by extension) this applies to you as well.

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:17.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, verse 18

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is talking about the “unchangeable things”

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes the point
that “it is impossible for God to lie.”

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we just considered, that’s not a lie.

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s impossible for Jehovah to do that.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then the direction is

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:36.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to take firm hold
of the hope set before us.”

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the benefit of doing that,
according to verse 19:

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have this hope as an anchor

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the soul,

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[it’s] both sure and firm.”

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:50.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So your hope

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:54.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of living forever on a beautiful
paradise earth will anchor you,

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have to think about it.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t dwell on all of the critical times
we’re dealing with

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just say, “Oh, Jehovah!”

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on the future.

00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful promise
that will anchor you.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll keep you stable
emotionally and mentally

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:16.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these critical last days.

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So look forward to the day when,

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:23.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it promises there in Ezekiel chapter 34,

00:09:23.512 --> 00:09:25.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able—

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:28.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With no vicious animals anywhere,

00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:32.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to securely sleep
in the forest.

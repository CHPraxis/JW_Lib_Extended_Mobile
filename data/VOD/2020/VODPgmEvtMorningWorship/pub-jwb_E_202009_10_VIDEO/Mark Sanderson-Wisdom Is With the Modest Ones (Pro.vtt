Modesty is absolutely essential

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:06.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to having a good relationship

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.025 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:13.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We remember what Micah 6:8 tells us:

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.067 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“He has told you, O man, what is good.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And what is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only to exercise justice, 

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to cherish loyalty, 

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:30.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:34.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, what does modesty mean to you?

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:37.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You probably, when you listened
to the comments this morning, 

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:40.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heard a variety of different definitions.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them had a common theme, 

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:46.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but each one had a slightly different sense.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of 2000 made
some very interesting comments  

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the definition of modesty.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said:
“Modesty can mean a number of things, 

00:00:55.972 --> 00:01:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such as a lack of conceit, or vanity, 

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:03.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and a reluctance to boast 
about one’s abilities, 

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:06.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“achievements, and possessions.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“According to one reference work, 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“modesty also means ‘keeping within bounds.’

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A modest person

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stays within the bounds of good behavior.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He also acknowledges
 that there are limits  

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:26.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to what he ought to do 
and is able to do.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He knows that there are things

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:31.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to which he is not entitled.”

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very interesting definition,
isn’t it?

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it kind of helps us to see

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are many shades of meaning
involved with this word.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s center our discussion this morning
on that last thought.

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:49.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A modest person “acknowledges
that there are limits

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what he ought to do
and is able to do.”

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, to be modest,
we understand,

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves recognizing
our own personal limitations.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:04.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes it’s easier
to be able to see our physical limitations.

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:08.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if you’re not a strong swimmer, 
probably when you go to the beach,

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you won’t swim right out
into the ocean, will you?

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll recognize your limitations.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if you’re not in good shape, 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you probably won’t sign up
for the New York marathon.

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:21.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we are able to see 

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re not able to do
some of these physical tasks.

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But modesty goes far beyond

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:32.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just simply acknowledging
our own physical limitations.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look
at an example from the Scriptures

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to see this,
perhaps more clearly.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 1 Samuel chapter 26,

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to start reading
here at verse 7,

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:48.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so 1 Samuel 26:7.

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just to set the context for you here,

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:56.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll remember that David
had been hiding from King Saul,

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was seeking to kill him.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a golden opportunity came for David

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to put an end to Saul 

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:10.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to all of this hiding
that David had had to be doing for so long.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s read what it says,
verse 7: 

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:16.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So David and Abishai made their way
to the troops by night,

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they found Saul lying asleep
in the camp enclosure 

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:24.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with his spear stuck to the ground
next to his head; 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abner and the troops
were lying all around him.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abishai now said to David: 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Today God has surrendered
your enemy into your hand.

00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And now, please,
let me pin him to the ground 

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:40.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘with the spear just once,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will not need to do it twice.’

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, David said to Abishai: 

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not harm him,

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:54.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for who can lift his hand
against the anointed of Jehovah

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:56.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and remain innocent?’

00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:58.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“David continued:

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘As surely as Jehovah is living,

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah himself will strike him down,

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘or his day will come and he will die,

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘or he will go down into battle and perish.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for me to lift my hand
against the anointed of Jehovah!

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:22.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘So now take, please,
the spear next to his head and the water jug,

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:24.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let us be on our way.’”

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, it would have been so easy

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for David to kill Saul, right?

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped David

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:36.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to act modestly in this situation?

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:39.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider the first factor:

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:43.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David had to consider his own position,

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or his own authority.

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, had Jehovah
instructed David to kill Saul?

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:51.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:55.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had never assigned David
to carry out that task.

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:59.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, Saul was anointed by Jehovah

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:01.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the king of Israel,

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so David acknowledged

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he simply did not have
the authority to kill Saul.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not his place.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s consider a second factor.

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 10.

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what David said?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“As surely as Jehovah is living, 

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah himself will strike him down,

00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:27.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or his day will come and he will die,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or he will go down into battle and perish.”

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, David had
complete confidence in Jehovah.

00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, instead of taking matters
into his own hands,

00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:41.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had the total confidence

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was going
to handle this situation 

00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his own way and in his own time

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:52.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David modestly trusted in Jehovah.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, David acted modestly on that occasion.

00:05:56.906 --> 00:06:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But perhaps you can think
of a few other occasions later in his life

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he didn’t act so modestly.

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:05.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty is a quality

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must work hard to develop,

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we must also work hard
to maintain our modesty.

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, our minds can begin to focus

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:23.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our strengths, on our talents,
and on our abilities

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to such an extent

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:30.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we begin to get
a very distorted view of self.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that happens,
our modesty can begin to disappear,

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can begin to behave presumptuously.

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:42.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, who is one of the greatest examples
of this in the Bible?

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps right away
you think of the example of Uzziah.

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:51.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you go in your Bible
to 2 Chronicles chapter 26, 

00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:53.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s just review for a minute

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we know about Uzziah
and what happened to him.

00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see in 2 Chronicles 26:4—

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see what it says?

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He [speaking of Uzziah]

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:09.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continued to do what was right
in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as his father Amaziah had done.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And [you notice this]
he kept searching for God

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:20.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the days of Zechariah,
who taught him to fear the true God.

00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During the time
he was searching for Jehovah,

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the true God made him prosper.”

00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, do you hear the modesty there?
Did you hear it?

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you see, it says Uzziah
was not a self-satisfied person

00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:36.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at that point in his life.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was searching for Jehovah.

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:42.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He felt the need for Jehovah’s guidance

00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wisdom and blessing in his life.

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go down to verse 16,
do you see?

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:53.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, as soon as he was strong,

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:58.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“his heart became haughty
to his own ruin,

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he acted unfaithfully
against Jehovah his God

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by entering the temple of Jehovah

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to burn incense on the altar of incense.”

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine?

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became so emboldened

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he actually went into Jehovah’s temple

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and burned incense on the altar of incense.

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the priests came running.

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did they say to him?
Do you see verse 18?

00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:26.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is not proper for you, Uzziah,
to burn incense to Jehovah!

00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:29.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is only the priest
who should burn incense,

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for they are the descendants of Aaron,
those who have been sanctified.

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go out from the sanctuary,

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you have acted unfaithfully

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:43.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will receive no glory
from Jehovah God for this.”

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Uzziah started out fearing God.

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:50.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He started out searching for Jehovah,

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:53.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when he became powerful,
what happened?

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He quickly lost his modesty.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, brothers,
why is this an important discussion,

00:09:00.923 --> 00:09:03.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really, for all of us?

00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:07.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, all of us face
trying situations in life.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we face those situations,

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be tempted

00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:16.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to want to rush in and handle them.

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:20.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may be tempted
to ignore Bible principles

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even published direction that we have

00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:31.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wise we are in those moments,
in those situations, 

00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:33.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to step back for a moment,

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take a deep breath, count to ten,

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say to ourselves:

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I really have the authority
to do what I’m about to do?

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is it really my place to say
what I’m about to say?

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:51.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Instead, would it be better

00:09:51.574 --> 00:09:55.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wait on Jehovah
to correct this situation?’

00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:59.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, by having a proper view of self,

00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sticking closely to the direction
that we have from Jehovah 

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:06.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from “the faithful and discreet slave,” 

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by maintaining our full
and complete confidence 

00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:12.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will correct any matters 

00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that need to be rectified,

00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can have the privilege to walk

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:21.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just for a short time
but to walk eternally—

00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:24.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in modesty with our magnificent,

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:26.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wonderful God, Jehovah.

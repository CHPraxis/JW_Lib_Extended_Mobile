00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:04.654 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What are your convenient times?

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:06.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our text for today discusses

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:08.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one of the temptations

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.927 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Satan presented to Jesus.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.830 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Luke 4:13 later says

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that then Satan goes away

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to return at “another convenient time”
to tempt Jesus.

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with all that in mind, we’re going
to consider three questions today:

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) What were these three temptations
really about?

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:33.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) Did Satan ever find a convenient time

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come back and tempt Jesus?

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) Does Satan try to use
these temptations today?

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:43.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to look at Matthew’s account
of these three temptations

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try to answer those questions.

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s start first with Matthew 4:2, 3.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “After he had fasted
for 40 days and 40 nights,

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he felt hungry.

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the Tempter approached and said to him:

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If you are a son of God,

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell these stones
to become loaves of bread.’”

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our first question is,
What was at the root of this temptation?

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Satan knew full well

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:12.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was Jehovah’s firstborn Son,

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was trying to get Jesus to question

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was who Jehovah said he was.

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:23.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘</i>If you are a son of God,

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘why hasn’t your Father fed you?

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you really trust Jehovah
to take care of you?’

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:32.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Satan wanted Jesus
to begin to question Jehovah’s care

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:36.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use his position to benefit himself.

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus recognized
that this was a temptation,

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did not fall for it.

00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:43.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Question two is, Did Satan ever come back

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try this trick again with Jesus?

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when Jesus was arrested,
could that have been a convenient time?

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:55.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jesus said that he
could have called on “12 legions of angels”

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come and save him.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could that have been a temptation
to save himself?

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or remember when he was on the stake,

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:07.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rulers and the soldiers
taunted him and said,

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:12.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you are a son of God,
come on down off the stake!’

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that they used
the same terminology.

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could that have been a temptation?

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:18.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus trusted
that Jehovah would take care of him.

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our third question is,
Does Satan use that temptation today?

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we are living in unsettled times.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are these convenient times for Satan?

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:35.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our families and our friends may be in need.

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we be tempted to question

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we really trust
that Jehovah is going to take care of them?

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we be convinced or convince ourselves

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:48.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we may need to take matters
into our own hands?

00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we ever tempted
to use our privileges of service

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:54.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to benefit ourselves?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at the second temptation.

00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:59.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 4:5, 6 says:

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the Devil took him along
into the holy city,

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:04.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he stationed him
on the battlement of the temple

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and said to him: ‘If you are a son of God,

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:10.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘throw yourself down, for it is written:

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:13.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“He will give his angels a command
concerning you,”

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and, “They will carry you on their hands,

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not strike your foot
against a stone.”’”

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, what was the root here?

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Satan was again trying
to cast doubt on who Jesus was.

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:30.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you are who you say you are, prove it.

00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:32.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Let’s see if Jehovah
really is there for you.

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He does value you.

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:36.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’ll save you because Psalms says

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s what he’ll do
for the real Son of God.’

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus saw that this was a temptation
and did not fall for it.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Satan ever try
such a temptation again?

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:49.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps another time

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what’s recorded at Mark 8:11,

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the Pharisees came,
and the account says

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they “started disputing with him,

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demanding from him a sign from heaven,
to put him to the test.”

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:06.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus had just healed
a deaf and speechless man

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and miraculously fed over 4,000 people,
but that wasn’t enough for them.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted something spectacular.

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Throw yourself off the temple or something.

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:19.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Prove you are who you say you are.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see if Jehovah really values you.’

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:26.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when might we face a similar temptation?

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, some of our brothers and sisters
may feel unlovable

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of events in their life.

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:37.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Times of isolation and depression
may be convenient times

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Satan to attack them.

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:43.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I sure Jehovah really loves me?

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:45.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I sure I’m important to Jehovah?

00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I have value?’

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, such feelings have caused ones
to stop serving Jehovah

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to seek validation of their value

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:56.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through unscriptural means.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at our third temptation.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 4:8, 9:

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Again the Devil took him along
to an unusually high mountain

00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and showed him all the kingdoms of the world
and their glory.

00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he said to him:
‘All these things I will give you

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you fall down
and do an act of worship to me.’”

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:17.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was Satan offering here?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t wait! You can have it now.

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You know what’s coming
—the pain that’s coming.

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My offer is better than Jehovah’s.’

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, Jesus recognized
what Satan was doing,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he resisted that temptation.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Satan ever find a convenient time
to try that again?

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps the account
at Luke 6:15 explains

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what may have been another convenient time.

00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the people wanted
Jesus to begin ruling right then.

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:47.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could that have been a temptation
to get his Kingdom started

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the pain of being tortured to death?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, knowing that the people
were coming for him,

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus withdrew.

00:05:56.172 --> 00:05:59.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we face similar temptations today?

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:04.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we willingly make sacrifices
and have made sacrifices to serve Jehovah.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we may see what others do
and what others have and wonder:

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Are our sacrifices really worth it?

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there any way I can have it now?

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe if there’s a way I can make
some more money, I could do both

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the things I want.’

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, three powerful temptations:

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you trust that your Father
will take care of you?

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sure Jehovah loves you
and you have value?

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why wait when you can have it now?

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again, the question is,

00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are your convenient times?

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are my convenient times?

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:46.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is going to find convenient times
to tempt us—that’s a given.

00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:8 says that he’s out there

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“like a roaring lion,
seeking to devour [us].”

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he found convenient times to tempt Jesus,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be sure
that he will do the same to us.

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we need to do?

00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our job is to resist his temptations.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do that?

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:08.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same way that Jesus did.

00:07:08.277 --> 00:07:10.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the two things he did?

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Jesus recognized

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was being tempted,

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (2) at that moment,
he focused on Jehovah.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting
that in every one of his responses to Satan,

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:26.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he used Jehovah’s name.

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:31.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah’s name is a powerful protection
against Satan’s attacks.

00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Jesus listed praying to Jehovah

00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:37.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resist temptation,
to resist the wicked one,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a fundamental part when he was teaching
his disciples how to pray.

00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:46.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Jesus said that he made
Jehovah’s name known to his followers.

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Proverbs 18:10 tells us
that Jehovah’s name

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:54.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a strong tower”
that we can run to for protection.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, speaking with Jehovah, using his name,

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on his name
and everything that it means

00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help us when we are being tempted
by Satan

00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when he finds convenient times to attack us.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:12.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we do that, what will be the result?

00:08:12.008 --> 00:08:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice the guarantee that we have

00:08:14.477 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 44:5

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 44:5.

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “By your power

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:26.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we will drive back our adversaries;

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in your name

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:30.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we will trample down

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:33.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who rise up against us.”

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, all of us are going to find times

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:40.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan finds convenient to tempt us.

00:08:40.903 --> 00:08:44.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that happens,
may we be sensitive to recognize

00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is a temptation

00:08:47.143 --> 00:08:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then look to Jehovah
and focus on his name.

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we do, we can have the confidence

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that as this psalm says, this will help—

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s name will help us
to drive back and trample

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who rise against us individually

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as an organization.

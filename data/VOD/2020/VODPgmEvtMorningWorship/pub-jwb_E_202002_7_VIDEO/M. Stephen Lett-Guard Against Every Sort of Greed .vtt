00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:03.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, my theme is

00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:07.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Guard Against Every Sort of Greed.”

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah lovingly gave counsel

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch,

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:17.701 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to stop “seeking great things” for himself.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what were those great things?

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know for sure,

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:26.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps prominence
or material things or both.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:30.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what bad quality was developing

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Baruch’s heart that Jehovah saw?

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greed.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:38.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Insight book defines greed

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:42.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “inordinate or rapacious desire.”

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dictionary says it’s “a selfish, . . .

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“excessive desire for more of something

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(such as money) than is needed.”

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:54.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in effect, Jehovah was telling Baruch,

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Stop being greedy.’

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in an extended application,

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells us the same thing.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, echoing Jehovah’s counsel to Baruch

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what Jesus tells us.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ll open up to Luke chapter 12,

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read our theme scripture here.

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 12:15

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—similar counsel from Jesus—

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 12:15:

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he [that is Jesus] said to them:

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:28.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Keep your eyes open and guard [now notice]

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:31.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘against every sort of greed,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:35.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because even
when a person has an abundance,

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘his life does not result

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the things he possesses.’”

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what makes it a challenge, though,

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:47.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to “guard against
every sort of greed,” as Jesus counseled?

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our three great enemies.

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s discuss each of these

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how it makes it a challenge.

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first, our imperfect flesh.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Genesis 8:21, Jehovah said:

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The inclination of the heart of man

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is bad from his youth up.”

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one form of badness is greed.

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tendency toward greed
becomes manifest very early.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we see little toddlers

00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:18.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grab things and hold them tightly.

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:22.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mine, mine, mine.”

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:25.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That greed is starting to manifest, isn’t it?

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people look at a little toddler,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may say,
“What a cute little boy,”

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “He has his mother’s eyes
and his father’s nose.”

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they never invariably say:

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look at that little toddler.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an unselfish little toddler!”

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it takes a lot of effort
—doesn’t it?—

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:50.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach that little one
to be unselfish like Jehovah.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about our
second great enemy, Satan?

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Satan’s downfall?

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was greed.

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:00.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allowed a greedy desire for something 

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:04.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that belonged
to Jehovah alone to develop in his heart.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was that greed for?

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:08.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worship.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:12.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wants his downfall to be our downfall.

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:15.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to ensnare us in greed.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he tries to magnify, intensify,

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wrong tendency to be greedy.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it, how was Satan

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
able to entrap the perfect woman, Eve?

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He entrapped her in greed.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got her to crave, desire,

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what belonged to God alone.

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, he said to her:

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Eating of all the trees
of the garden minus one tree

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is not good enough.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You should crave that one tree

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has not been given to you.’

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let me, please, illustrate

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:57.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how greedy Satan made Adam and Eve

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:59.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how greedy they were.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like for you to imagine
that you have guests staying in your home,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you say, “Now, I really want you

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make yourselves
at home while you’re here.”

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You take them into the kitchen;

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you open the refrigerator and say:

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are all kinds of food here

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the cabinets
—the pantry—

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everything you could imagine
that you would want to eat.

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s yours.
Help yourself.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t even ask.”

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then you pull out
one little drawer, and you say:

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, I’ve set aside
some items for a later occasion.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, this is very important.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:34.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not eat from this one drawer.

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you’ll find other items just like

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:39.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in this drawer
in the pantry and the cabinets.

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:41.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll have everything you need.”

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, would that be overly restrictive?

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:46.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would that be
an unloving arrangement with your guests?

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’d be very generous, wouldn’t it?

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in effect, that’s the arrangement
Jehovah made with Adam and Eve.

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:55.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, back to the illustration:
If you came into the kitchen

00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you found your guests eating

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of that one drawer
that you had not given them,

00:05:02.452 --> 00:05:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d be very upset, wouldn’t you?

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’d probably view it as stealing,

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you likely would put
the thieves out of your house.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that illustrates
how Jehovah felt and how Jehovah reacted.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a protection being content

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what was rightfully hers
would have been to Eve!

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:26.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about
our third great enemy—the world?

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are relentlessly surrounded

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Satan’s world and his spirit,
called “the spirit of the world.”

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:39.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could say
that Jehovah breathes holy spirit

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:43.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to influence his people
to act like him and to be unselfish.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Satan, in effect, exhales

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stinky spirit of the world

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes people
act like him in being greedy.

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:59.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one way Satan’s world
promotes greed for material things

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:03.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by relentless advertising.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are constantly bombarded
with advertisements.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, here’s just an example:

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may bring out a shiny, new car;

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has about 12 coats of wax on it.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have all these spotlights shining on it.

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They bring in a camera
from all different angles

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, about this time,
a scantily clothed woman

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes strolling out to that automobile.

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you don’t even notice it, but there’s

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soft music playing in the background.

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:35.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As she opens the door and gets in,

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:39.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a crescendo is reached
in the background music.

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re made to feel like,

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:44.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You poor, poor loser

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you don’t have that car.’

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:50.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t talk about the heavy payments
you’re going to have to make

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how many meetings you’re going to have
to miss to make those payments.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You poor loser if you don’t have that car.’

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And similar advertising methods
are used very often

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in promoting
many other gadgets and material things.

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously, we have to fight hard
against the spirit of the world

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we don’t allow it

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to nurture greed in our hearts.

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:19.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if we’re not careful,
our love for Jehovah

00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be squeezed out

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:24.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by love for money
and love for material things.

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if this happens,

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:29.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than
conquering the world as Jesus did,

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world will have conquered us.

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:37.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it admittedly is a great challenge

00:07:37.306 --> 00:07:40.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fight these three great enemies and avoid,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus counseled, “every sort of greed.”

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, think of that—Jesus indicated

00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s not just one sort
of greed, one kind of greed.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greed can take on
various faces, or manifestations,

00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:56.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re to guard against all of them.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say is the antidote

00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can immunize us
against the poison of greed?

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:06.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is it not contentment?

00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
one sort of greed we talked about,

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greed for material things

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well, contentment will immunize us

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:18.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against this terrible form of greed.

00:08:18.948 --> 00:08:23.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re familiar with 1 Timothy 6:8:

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, having food and clothing,

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and the footnote adds “shelter.”]

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be content with these things.”

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So contentment really protects us.

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:38.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in effect,
that’s what Jehovah was telling Baruch;

00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:41.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was telling him:
‘You have what you need.

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Stop storing up great things,
or seeking great things.

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:48.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be content with what you have
and do more important things.’

00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:52.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he gave a powerful reason
why Baruch should do this.

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told him at Jeremiah 45:5:

00:08:55.918 --> 00:09:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am about to bring
a calamity on all flesh,”

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:02.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so if “you get the mastery over” this,

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will grant you your life as a spoil.”

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:10.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the same applies to us, doesn’t it?

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:14.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is soon going to bring
a calamity on all flesh,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we need to be content
with what we really need

00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘seek first the Kingdom.’

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:21.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just ‘temporary residents,’ aren’t we?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what 1 Peter 1:17 says.

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s an illustration
about a temporary resident.

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:29.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to imagine

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we rent a venue
for our regional convention.

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you may do a few things

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the stay
more comfortable in that venue.

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may do thorough cleaning;

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might do some touch-up painting;

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:49.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might repair
some broken toilets or light fixtures.

00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:53.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you would never paint and plaster
the entire stadium inside and out.

00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wouldn’t rip up the seats
and put all new seating in.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wouldn’t tear out
the parking lot and put in a new parking lot

00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you know
you’re just a temporary resident.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to vacate
that place after the weekend.

00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:11.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, unlike the illustration, we don’t know
exactly when we’re going to vacate,

00:10:11.093 --> 00:10:12.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know it’s soon.

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:14.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we keep it simple.

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:16.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just temporary residents.

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sort of greed
is greed for prominence.

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:21.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But being content

00:10:21.804 --> 00:10:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with how generous Jehovah
has been in giving us so many privileges

00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:27.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will protect us from this greed.

00:10:27.443 --> 00:10:31.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would’ve protected Korah in Moses’ time.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sort of greed
is greedy sexual desire.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re single or married,

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being content
with what rightfully belongs to us

00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:43.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will really be a protection.

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would have protected David
from his sin with Bath-sheba.

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:53.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or there are other sorts of greed,
such as gluttony and drunkenness.

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the antidote
for all of these is contentment

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—contentment with what is rightfully ours

00:11:01.544 --> 00:11:03.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has given to us.

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we are successful
in guarding against every sort of greed,

00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:12.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’ll be on hand
to enjoy the marvelous time

00:11:12.521 --> 00:11:15.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah will open his hand

00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and satisfy every proper
“desire of every living thing.”

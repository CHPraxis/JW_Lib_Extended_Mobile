Now, my discussion is about

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:06.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the miracle of prayer.

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What is one of the foremost ways

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.863 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we draw close to, we stay close to, Jehovah?

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:15.865 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
By means of prayer.

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In prayer, we experience Jehovah’s love

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a truly intimate way.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i> some years ago
made this comment:

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be assured that
through the miracle of prayer

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is able to listen to you.”

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s very appropriate
—to describe prayer as a miracle.

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think about it.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can pray in any language,

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though according to some linguists

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are more than 6,800 languages
spoken on the earth today.

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows all those languages.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re impressed if a person knows
two or three languages.

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows every language,
and that includes

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the, perhaps, 300 sign languages

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being used on earth today,
according to one encyclopedia.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows every sign language.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, our prayer can be a silent prayer

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:16.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uttered only in the privacy of our heart.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:20.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, if a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not even know what to pray for

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:26.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the perplexity of the situation

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or his mental anguish,

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Romans 8:26,

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the holy spirit can, in effect,

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
formulate a prayer in his behalf.

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:40.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is truly miraculous.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we know,
Jehovah has not delegated

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hearing of a prayer to anyone
—not even his Son.

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 65:2 calls Jehovah

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:52.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “Hearer of prayer.”

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “Hearer” is singular.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:57.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s a question:
What is prayer?

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, some have defined it
as talking to Jehovah.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:04.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that really accurate?

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:08.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to Genesis chapter 3, please.

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s use this scripture to answer that
—if it’s just talking to Jehovah.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 3:9:

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:23.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah God kept calling to the man
and saying to him:

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where are you?’

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, he [Adam] said:

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:31.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I heard your voice in the garden,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was afraid because I was naked
so I hid myself.’”

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, clearly, Adam was talking to Jehovah,
but it was not prayer.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have numerous other examples
in the Bible.

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, appropriately,
the <i>Insight </i> book defines prayer

00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “worshipful address to the true God.”

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it adds:
“[It] involves devotion, trust, respect,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and a sense of dependence

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:03.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the one to whom the prayer is directed.”

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s a very good point.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want Jehovah to view our prayer

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:09.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as not just talking to him but truly prayer,

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:13.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve got to make sure
it is worshipful address

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:17.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we attach devotion, trust,

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:22.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
respect, a deep sense 
of dependence on Jehovah.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, obviously, that would require
that we prepare our hearts

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we pray to Jehovah.

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra 7:10—Ezra “prepared his heart.”

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we would do well to do the same.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:39.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s another question,
What are the different types of prayer?

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our publications have explained

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:44.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are basically
four types of prayer.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have petition, supplication,

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanksgiving, and praise.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you boil it down even further,

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can say there are two types of prayer
—petition and thanksgiving—

00:03:57.787 --> 00:04:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because supplication is really
a form of petition

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just very deep petition, but petition.

00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:08.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And praise is a form of thanksgiving

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—thanking Jehovah
for being the God that he is.

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:16.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s briefly talk about
these four categories of prayer

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can divide it into.

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:20.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take first, petition.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like it sounds, we’re asking
—we’re requesting—of Jehovah.

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:29.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah encourages us
to ask him for our needs.

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 7:7, Jesus said:

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:36.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on asking, and it will be given you;

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“keep on seeking, and you will find;

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:42.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep on knocking,
and it will be opened to you.”

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, Jesus gives us things
we can pray for

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our daily bread,
forgiveness of our sins,

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deliverance from the evil one
as a few examples.

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:55.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s take supplication.

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:57.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i> explains

00:04:57.113 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the word means ‘earnest entreaty,’
. . . ‘beseeching prayer.’”

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involves imploring God very earnestly

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:09.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as in time of great stress or peril.

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to think of
a modern example of supplication,

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of a wife’s prayer

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:20.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the night before her husband is executed

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for keeping his integrity

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:25.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that would truly be supplication.

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go to thanksgiving.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:31.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As it sounds,
it’s the rendering of thanks to Jehovah.

00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how voluminous are the things

00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for which we should express
gratitude to Jehovah!

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think about all the material,
or physical, gifts

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that not only make life possible

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but make it enjoyable.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Every good gift and every perfect present
comes from Jehovah.’

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:54.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—James 1:17.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what about the spiritual gifts
that Jehovah showers upon us

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the benefits of that ransom sacrifice,

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:04.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the holy spirit, God’s Word,

00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:09.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christian congregation,
our marvelous Kingdom hope,

00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to mention a few things?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is only right that we thank Jehovah

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the things he has done,
is doing,

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will yet do in the future.

00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul said at Ephesians 5:20,

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:29.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should be “always giving thanks
to our God and Father

00:06:29.572 --> 00:06:31.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for everything.”

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:34.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s move to praise.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Praise is a noble, exalted form of prayer,

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we said before,
closely related to thanksgiving.

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:44.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could look at it this way.

00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:48.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanksgiving—we thank Jehovah
for the gifts he gives us;

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:52.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
praise—we thank Jehovah
for being the God he is

00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the qualities he has
that we appreciate so much.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, one brother said
that praise is “bragging on Jehovah.”

00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:06.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really harmonizes with
what Paul said at 1 Corinthians 1:31:

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who boasts,

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let him boast in Jehovah.”

00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is above all others.

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:18.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is certainly deserving of praise.

00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:23.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 15:11 tells us this.

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:26.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Who among the gods

00:07:26.062 --> 00:07:28.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is like you, O Jehovah?

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who is like you,
showing yourself mighty in holiness?

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:37.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One to be feared with songs of praise,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One doing wonders.”

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah is worthy

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:46.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our words in our songs of praise.

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there we have four types of prayer.

00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:52.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We mentioned petition, supplication,

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanksgiving, and praise.

00:07:55.791 --> 00:08:00.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, obviously, we should endeavor
to try to balance our prayers

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using a combination
of these different aspects of prayer.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:09.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we’re not especially careful,
there’s a danger

00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our prayers could become
lopsided with petition.

00:08:14.143 --> 00:08:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that would not be good, would it?

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I think of a survey

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:23.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the <i>Awake!</i> commented on
in “Watching the World,”

00:08:23.052 --> 00:08:25.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a survey among people who prayed.

00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And among those who still pray,
that survey showed

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that for most of them,
their prayers are only petitions.

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:36.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it said that they view God

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:39.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a divine Santa Claus:

00:08:39.635 --> 00:08:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give me this.
Give me that.

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help me with this.
Do this for me.”

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wouldn’t want our prayers

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:49.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to even slightly take on
a selfish tenor like that.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:54.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what probably is
the weakest aspect of most prayers?

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably praise.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not careful, our prayers 

00:08:59.422 --> 00:09:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could lack sufficient praise for Jehovah.

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it would be sad
because he is so deserving of praise.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, may we “persevere in prayer.”
—Romans 12:12.

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we “pray constantly.”
—1 Thessalonians 5:17.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may we strive to keep
our prayers balanced and heartfelt

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—truly “worshipful address”
to our heavenly Father.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will help us to draw close

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:31.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay close

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our wonderful heavenly Father.

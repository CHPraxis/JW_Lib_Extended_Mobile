00:00:01 Now, my discussion is about
00:00:03 the miracle of prayer.
00:00:06 What is one of the foremost ways
00:00:09 we draw close to, we stay close to, Jehovah?
00:00:13 By means of prayer.
00:00:15 In prayer, we experience Jehovah’s love
00:00:19 in a truly intimate way.
00:00:22 The Watchtower some years ago made this comment:
00:00:26 “Be assured that through the miracle of prayer
00:00:29 Jehovah is able to listen to you.”
00:00:33 And that’s very appropriate —to describe prayer as a miracle.
00:00:37 Let’s think about it.
00:00:38 You can pray in any language,
00:00:41 even though according to some linguists
00:00:44 there are more than 6,800 languages spoken on the earth today.
00:00:48 Jehovah knows all those languages.
00:00:51 Now, we’re impressed if a person knows two or three languages.
00:00:55 Jehovah knows every language, and that includes
00:00:58 the, perhaps, 300 sign languages
00:01:02 being used on earth today, according to one encyclopedia.
00:01:06 Jehovah knows every sign language.
00:01:09 In fact, our prayer can be a silent prayer
00:01:12 uttered only in the privacy of our heart.
00:01:17 Amazingly, if a faithful servant of Jehovah
00:01:20 does not even know what to pray for
00:01:22 because of the perplexity of the situation
00:01:26 or his mental anguish,
00:01:28 according to Romans 8:26,
00:01:30 the holy spirit can, in effect,
00:01:34 formulate a prayer in his behalf.
00:01:37 Now, that is truly miraculous.
00:01:40 And as we know, Jehovah has not delegated
00:01:43 the hearing of a prayer to anyone —not even his Son.
00:01:46 Psalm 65:2 calls Jehovah
00:01:50 the “Hearer of prayer.”
00:01:52 And “Hearer” is singular.
00:01:54 But here’s a question: What is prayer?
00:01:57 Well, some have defined it as talking to Jehovah.
00:02:02 But is that really accurate?
00:02:04 Go to Genesis chapter 3, please.
00:02:08 Let’s use this scripture to answer that —if it’s just talking to Jehovah.
00:02:13 Genesis 3:9:
00:02:18 “And Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him:
00:02:23 ‘Where are you?’
00:02:25 “Finally, he [Adam] said:
00:02:28 “‘I heard your voice in the garden,
00:02:31 but I was afraid because I was naked so I hid myself.’”
00:02:35 Well, clearly, Adam was talking to Jehovah, but it was not prayer.
00:02:40 And we have numerous other examples in the Bible.
00:02:44 So, appropriately, the Insight  book defines prayer
00:02:48 as “worshipful address to the true God.”
00:02:52 And then it adds: “[It] involves devotion, trust, respect,
00:02:57 “and a sense of dependence
00:02:59 on the one to whom the prayer is directed.”
00:03:03 So that’s a very good point.
00:03:04 If we want Jehovah to view our prayer
00:03:07 as not just talking to him but truly prayer,
00:03:09 we’ve got to make sure it is worshipful address
00:03:13 and that we attach devotion, trust,
00:03:17 respect, a deep sense  of dependence on Jehovah.
00:03:22 And, obviously, that would require that we prepare our hearts
00:03:26 before we pray to Jehovah.
00:03:29 Ezra 7:10—Ezra “prepared his heart.”
00:03:32 Well, we would do well to do the same.
00:03:34 But now, here’s another question, What are the different types of prayer?
00:03:39 Well, our publications have explained
00:03:41 that there are basically four types of prayer.
00:03:44 We have petition, supplication,
00:03:48 thanksgiving, and praise.
00:03:51 And if you boil it down even further,
00:03:53 you can say there are two types of prayer —petition and thanksgiving—
00:03:57 because supplication is really a form of petition
00:04:01 —just very deep petition, but petition.
00:04:04 And praise is a form of thanksgiving
00:04:08 —thanking Jehovah for being the God that he is.
00:04:12 But now, let’s briefly talk about these four categories of prayer
00:04:16 we can divide it into.
00:04:18 Take first, petition.
00:04:20 Just like it sounds, we’re asking —we’re requesting—of Jehovah.
00:04:25 And Jehovah encourages us to ask him for our needs.
00:04:29 At Matthew 7:7, Jesus said:
00:04:32 “Keep on asking, and it will be given you;
00:04:36 “keep on seeking, and you will find;
00:04:39 keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.”
00:04:42 And, of course, Jesus gives us things we can pray for
00:04:45 —our daily bread, forgiveness of our sins,
00:04:49 deliverance from the evil one as a few examples.
00:04:52 But now, let’s take supplication.
00:04:55 The Watchtower explains
00:04:57 that “the word means ‘earnest entreaty,’ . . . ‘beseeching prayer.’”
00:05:01 It involves imploring God very earnestly
00:05:05 as in time of great stress or peril.
00:05:09 If you want to think of a modern example of supplication,
00:05:14 think of a wife’s prayer
00:05:16 the night before her husband is executed
00:05:20 for keeping his integrity
00:05:22 —that would truly be supplication.
00:05:25 Now, let’s go to thanksgiving.
00:05:27 As it sounds, it’s the rendering of thanks to Jehovah.
00:05:31 And how voluminous are the things
00:05:35 for which we should express gratitude to Jehovah!
00:05:38 We think about all the material, or physical, gifts
00:05:42 that not only make life possible
00:05:46 but make it enjoyable.
00:05:48 ‘Every good gift and every perfect present comes from Jehovah.’
00:05:52 —James 1:17.
00:05:54 And then what about the spiritual gifts that Jehovah showers upon us
00:05:58 —the benefits of that ransom sacrifice,
00:06:01 the holy spirit, God’s Word,
00:06:04 the Christian congregation, our marvelous Kingdom hope,
00:06:09 just to mention a few things?
00:06:12 It is only right that we thank Jehovah
00:06:15 for the things he has done, is doing,
00:06:19 and will yet do in the future.
00:06:21 As Paul said at Ephesians 5:20,
00:06:24 we should be “always giving thanks to our God and Father
00:06:29 for everything.”
00:06:31 But now, let’s move to praise.
00:06:34 Praise is a noble, exalted form of prayer,
00:06:38 as we said before, closely related to thanksgiving.
00:06:41 We could look at it this way.
00:06:44 Thanksgiving—we thank Jehovah for the gifts he gives us;
00:06:48 praise—we thank Jehovah for being the God he is
00:06:52 and for the qualities he has that we appreciate so much.
00:06:56 See, one brother said that praise is “bragging on Jehovah.”
00:07:01 And that really harmonizes with what Paul said at 1 Corinthians 1:31:
00:07:06 “The one who boasts,
00:07:08 let him boast in Jehovah.”
00:07:11 Jehovah is above all others.
00:07:14 He is certainly deserving of praise.
00:07:18 Exodus 15:11 tells us this.
00:07:23 It says: “Who among the gods
00:07:26 “is like you, O Jehovah?
00:07:28 “Who is like you, showing yourself mighty in holiness?
00:07:33 “The One to be feared with songs of praise,
00:07:37 the One doing wonders.”
00:07:39 Yes, Jehovah is worthy
00:07:42 of our words in our songs of praise.
00:07:46 Well, there we have four types of prayer.
00:07:49 We mentioned petition, supplication,
00:07:52 thanksgiving, and praise.
00:07:55 And, obviously, we should endeavor to try to balance our prayers
00:08:00 using a combination of these different aspects of prayer.
00:08:05 Now, if we’re not especially careful, there’s a danger
00:08:09 that our prayers could become lopsided with petition.
00:08:14 Now that would not be good, would it?
00:08:16 In fact, I think of a survey
00:08:19 that the Awake! commented on in “Watching the World,”
00:08:23 a survey among people who prayed.
00:08:25 And among those who still pray, that survey showed
00:08:28 that for most of them, their prayers are only petitions.
00:08:33 And then it said that they view God
00:08:36 like a divine Santa Claus:
00:08:39 “Give me this. Give me that.
00:08:41 Help me with this. Do this for me.”
00:08:43 We wouldn’t want our prayers
00:08:45 to even slightly take on a selfish tenor like that.
00:08:49 And what probably is the weakest aspect of most prayers?
00:08:54 Probably praise.
00:08:56 If we’re not careful, our prayers
00:08:59 could lack sufficient praise for Jehovah.
00:09:02 And it would be sad because he is so deserving of praise.
00:09:06 Well, may we “persevere in prayer.” —Romans 12:12.
00:09:11 May we “pray constantly.” —1 Thessalonians 5:17.
00:09:16 And may we strive to keep our prayers balanced and heartfelt
00:09:21 —truly “worshipful address” to our heavenly Father.
00:09:26 And this will help us to draw close
00:09:29 and stay close
00:09:31 to our wonderful heavenly Father.

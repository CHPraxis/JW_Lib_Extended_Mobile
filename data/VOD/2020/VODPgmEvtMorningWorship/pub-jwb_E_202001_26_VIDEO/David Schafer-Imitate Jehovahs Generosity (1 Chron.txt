00:00:01 Imagine that you’re eating
00:00:04 your favorite fruit
00:00:06 —a cool, crisp watermelon;
00:00:10 a fragrant peach;
00:00:13 a juicy pear; or that apple
00:00:15 in front of you at the breakfast table—
00:00:18 refreshing, distinctive, nutritious.
00:00:23 And then you get to the seed.
00:00:26 Most people consider that to be a waste product,
00:00:30 and yet that seed tells us
00:00:33 much about our Creator.
00:00:37 It’s revealed for us
00:00:39 in 2 Corinthians chapter 9.
00:00:42 Please turn there, and we’re going to consider together verses 8-15.
00:00:48 Jehovah has a remarkable quality
00:00:52 that we want to discuss today.
00:00:54 Jehovah wants us to enjoy
00:00:57 good, delicious food today.
00:01:00 But not only that, he wants us to enjoy it again and again and again.
00:01:05 And he wants all of our offspring
00:01:08 to enjoy these good things again and again.
00:01:12 And if you were to plant all of the seeds
00:01:15 in one piece of fruit,
00:01:18 you would yield more than you could possibly eat by yourself.
00:01:23 By conservative estimates, one watermelon contains 200 seeds
00:01:28 and each seed produces a vine
00:01:30 and each vine produces,
00:01:33 by conservative estimates, two fruits.
00:01:36 So you would have
00:01:39 with just the seeds of one melon
00:01:42 400 more watermelons,
00:01:45 far more than you could eat by yourself in one season.
00:01:50 And there’s a good reason for that.
00:01:52 Now as we look at 2 Corinthians chapter 9,
00:01:56 we want to examine this passage carefully.
00:01:58 Verse 8 begins with an important expression
00:02:02 that we need to understand clearly:
00:02:05 God’s “undeserved kindness.”
00:02:09 So let’s read verse 8, then we’ll define the term,
00:02:12 then we’ll discuss the purpose of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness
00:02:17 (and eventually, we’ll get around to watermelons),
00:02:20 and we’ll come to understand what all of this has to do with our worship.
00:02:25 Second Corinthians 9:8:
00:02:28 “Moreover, God is able to cause
00:02:31 “all his undeserved kindness
00:02:35 “to abound toward you
00:02:38 “so that you are always completely
00:02:42 “self-sufficient in everything,
00:02:44 “as well as having plenty
00:02:48 for every good work.”
00:02:52 Now, first, that expression “undeserved kindness”
00:02:57 —do you have a clear understanding of that term?
00:03:00 It’s difficult to translate perfectly in English.
00:03:05 It’s not an expression of judgment, as if to say,
00:03:10 “You are nowhere close to deserving this, but I’m going to provide it anyway.”
00:03:13 No. That’s not the concept at all.
00:03:17 The term is describing not the recipient
00:03:20 but the giver.
00:03:22 Jehovah is ready to give.
00:03:26 That is his disposition.
00:03:27 You didn’t pay him first.
00:03:29 He is disposed to share himself
00:03:32 —his generous, good, loving, kind qualities—
00:03:36 not because you earned it and obligated him,
00:03:38 but because that is who he is.
00:03:41 He is great, and yet he is humble and willing
00:03:44 to give in ways grander
00:03:47 than we could ever imagine or repay.
00:03:52 That is what undeserved kindness means.
00:03:55 And you’ll find the essence of that definition
00:03:57 in your “Glossary of Bible Terms.”
00:04:00 Now, Jehovah could just miraculously endow
00:04:03 people with an abundance of good things,
00:04:05 as he did in the garden of Eden or as he did with the manna provision,
00:04:09 but he does something even better.
00:04:11 He allows his friends to participate
00:04:14 in showing this quality of his to the extent
00:04:18 that we can within the limitations of our human imperfection,
00:04:22 and he does that because he knows it makes us happy.
00:04:26 “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving”
00:04:29 because it gives us the opportunity to show
00:04:32 how we feel about Jehovah and about people
00:04:36 and because our showing love
00:04:39 draws us closer to Jehovah
00:04:41 and strengthens the bonds of our worldwide brotherhood.
00:04:46 Now notice how all of this is borne out in that verse:
00:04:50 “God is able to cause
00:04:52 “all of his undeserved kindness to abound
00:04:56 “toward you so that you are
00:05:00 “always completely self-sufficient in everything,
00:05:02 as well as having plenty for every good work.”
00:05:05 And verse 9 says: “(Just as it is written
00:05:08 “[at Psalm 112:9]:
00:05:11 “‘He [that is, the generous person who fears Jehovah]
00:05:15 “‘has distributed widely; he has given to the poor.
00:05:19 His righteousness continues forever.’)”
00:05:23 So are these verses suggesting
00:05:26 that Jehovah’s undeserved kindness is so great
00:05:30 that his servants will always have enough for themselves
00:05:35 and plenty to share with others
00:05:40 as acts of righteousness?
00:05:43 Yes, that is exactly
00:05:46 what these verses are teaching us!
00:05:48 The question I need to ask myself is:
00:05:53 ‘Do I thoroughly believe that?
00:05:57 ‘Do I believe that a generous person
00:06:01 ‘suffers no loss
00:06:04 ‘because Jehovah enables him to do righteous deeds?
00:06:08 ‘because Jehovah more than makes up for it
00:06:11 ‘with his undeserved kindness so that those acts of righteousness
00:06:15 may continue forever?’
00:06:19 Remember the evidence
00:06:21 in every fruit
00:06:23 and vegetable that you eat.
00:06:26 God puts a seed in each one.
00:06:29 And if you were to plant all the seeds found in one fruit,
00:06:33 you would have more than you could possibly eat by yourself.
00:06:38 Verses 10 and 11 use this exact illustration:
00:06:41 “(Now the One who abundantly supplies seed to the sower
00:06:46 “and bread for eating will supply and multiply
00:06:49 “the seed for you to sow and will increase the harvest
00:06:53 “of your righteousness.)
00:06:56 “In everything you are being enriched
00:07:00 “for every sort of generosity,
00:07:05 “which produces through us
00:07:07 an expression of thanks to God.”
00:07:12 Beautiful verses.
00:07:14 So why does Jehovah provide so bountifully?
00:07:17 So that (the words of verse 8) you and I can be generous.
00:07:22 Clearly, generosity is an act of faith and love.
00:07:26 But why can it be said that generosity
00:07:29 is also an expression of worship?
00:07:33 Well, look at how verse 11 continues:
00:07:35 “Generosity . . . produces through us
00:07:37 an expression of thanks to God.”
00:07:40 Think of it.
00:07:41 Your generosity causes prayer,
00:07:45 which is worship.
00:07:47 And not only that, verse 12 continues:
00:07:50 “Because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well
00:07:54 “for the needs of the holy ones but also to be rich
00:07:57 in many expressions of thanks to God.”
00:08:01 At the annual meeting, we learned about the almost $50 million (U.S.)
00:08:05 that our organization just spent on disaster relief
00:08:08 during the last two service years.
00:08:11 And we saw before and after photos
00:08:14 of the homes of some of our brothers.
00:08:17 We were pleased to note that our brothers
00:08:20 are well cared for.
00:08:22 And verse 12 calls that work a “ministry.”
00:08:27 It is sacred service, and, as such,
00:08:30 it results in many expressions of thanks to Jehovah.
00:08:35 And verse 13 continues: “Through the proof
00:08:40 “that this relief ministry gives,
00:08:43 “they glorify God because you
00:08:46 are submissive to the good news about the Christ.”
00:08:49 Yes, you are real Christians.
00:08:53 You live what you believe “as you publicly declared,
00:08:57 “and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all.
00:09:02 “And with supplication for you, they express affection for you
00:09:06 “because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you.
00:09:11 “Thanks be to God
00:09:13 for his indescribable free gift”
00:09:17 —that is to say, his undeserved kindness,
00:09:19 his disposition
00:09:22 to be generous beyond our imagination or ability to repay.
00:09:26 That is the gift that enables us
00:09:29 to keep giving.
00:09:31 Each day, millions of prayers of gratitude
00:09:35 ascend to Jehovah for your generosity.
00:09:39 That strengthens the bonds of our brotherhood.
00:09:42 Now, how are you able to be generous?
00:09:44 Where did you get the time, the energy,
00:09:46 the resources, the idea, the motivation,
00:09:50 the love, the opportunity to give of yourself in this way?
00:09:54 Jehovah gave us these things through his undeserved kindness.
00:09:58 And when you support Kingdom work, you help those in need.
00:10:02 And Jehovah is worshipped,
00:10:05 as the words of our day’s text say at 1 Chronicles 29:14:
00:10:09 ‘Everything is from Jehovah, and we have given
00:10:11 to him what comes from his own hand.’
00:10:13 You have drawn the right conclusion
00:10:15 from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,
00:10:18 from his disposition to give freely.
00:10:20 You have trusted in his promise;
00:10:23 you have imitated his goodness;
00:10:25 you are participating in his happiness.
00:10:29 This is how Jehovah’s organization functions.
00:10:33 May Jehovah continue to bless you richly
00:10:36 for your participation in that.

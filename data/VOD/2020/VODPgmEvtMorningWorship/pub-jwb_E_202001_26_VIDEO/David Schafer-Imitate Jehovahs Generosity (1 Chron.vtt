Imagine that you’re eating

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.690 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
your favorite fruit

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—a cool, crisp watermelon;

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a fragrant peach;

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.398 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a juicy pear; or that apple

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:17.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of you at the breakfast table—

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:23.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refreshing, distinctive, nutritious.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you get to the seed.

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most people consider
that to be a waste product,

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet that seed tells us

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much about our Creator.

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s revealed for us

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Corinthians chapter 9.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:47.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there, and we’re going
to consider together verses 8-15.

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has a remarkable quality

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:54.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we want to discuss today.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:57.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to enjoy

00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
good, delicious food today.

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:05.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only that, he wants us
to enjoy it again and again and again.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:08.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wants all of our offspring

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy these good things again and again.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you were to plant all of the seeds

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one piece of fruit,

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:23.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you would yield more
than you could possibly eat by yourself.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By conservative estimates,
one watermelon contains 200 seeds

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and each seed produces a vine

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and each vine produces,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by conservative estimates, two fruits.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you would have

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:42.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just the seeds of one melon

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
400 more watermelons,

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:50.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
far more than you could eat
by yourself in one season.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s a good reason for that.

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now as we look at 2 Corinthians chapter 9,

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to examine this passage carefully.

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8 begins with an important expression

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:05.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to understand clearly:

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:09.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s “undeserved kindness.”

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:12.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s read verse 8,
then we’ll define the term,

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’ll discuss the purpose
of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and eventually,
we’ll get around to watermelons),

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll come to understand
what all of this has to do with our worship.

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 9:8:

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, God is able to cause

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:35.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all his undeserved kindness

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:38.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to abound toward you

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you are always completely

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“self-sufficient in everything,

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as well as having plenty

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:51.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every good work.”

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first, that expression
“undeserved kindness”

00:02:57.227 --> 00:03:00.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—do you have
a clear understanding of that term?

00:03:00.363 --> 00:03:05.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult
to translate perfectly in English.

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:10.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not an expression
of judgment, as if to say,

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are nowhere close to deserving this,
but I’m going to provide it anyway.”

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
That’s not the concept at all.

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:20.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The term is describing not the recipient

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the giver.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is ready to give.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is his disposition.

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You didn’t pay him first.

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is disposed to share himself

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his generous, good, loving, kind qualities—

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not because you earned it and obligated him,

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because that is who he is.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is great, and yet he is humble and willing

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give in ways grander

00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than we could ever imagine or repay.

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what undeserved kindness means.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll find
the essence of that definition

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your “Glossary of Bible Terms.”

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah could just miraculously endow

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people with an abundance of good things,

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he did in the garden of Eden
or as he did with the manna provision,

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he does something even better.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allows his friends to participate

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:18.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in showing this quality of his to the extent

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:22.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can within the limitations
of our human imperfection,

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he does that because
he knows it makes us happy.

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness
in giving than there is in receiving”

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it gives us the opportunity to show

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we feel about Jehovah and about people

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because our showing love

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draws us closer to Jehovah

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:46.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthens the bonds
of our worldwide brotherhood.

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice how all of this
is borne out in that verse:

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is able to cause

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all of his undeserved kindness to abound 

00:04:56.145 --> 00:05:00.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward you so that you are

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“always completely
self-sufficient in everything,

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:05.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as having plenty
for every good work.”

00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:08.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 9 says: “(Just as it is written

00:05:08.424 --> 00:05:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[at Psalm 112:9]:

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:15.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘He [that is, the generous person
who fears Jehovah]

00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘has distributed widely;
he has given to the poor.

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:23.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His righteousness continues forever.’)”

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:26.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So are these verses suggesting

00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s undeserved kindness
is so great

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his servants will always
have enough for themselves

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:40.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and plenty to share with others

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as acts of righteousness?

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that is exactly

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:48.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what these verses are teaching us!

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question I need to ask myself is:

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I thoroughly believe that?

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:01.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I believe that a generous person

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘suffers no loss

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because Jehovah enables him
to do righteous deeds?

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:11.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because Jehovah more than makes up for it

00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘with his undeserved kindness
so that those acts of righteousness

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may continue forever?’

00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:21.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the evidence

00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every fruit

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and vegetable that you eat.

00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God puts a seed in each one.

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you were to plant
all the seeds found in one fruit,

00:06:33.843 --> 00:06:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you would have more than
you could possibly eat by yourself.

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 10 and 11 use this exact illustration:

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(Now the One who abundantly supplies
seed to the sower

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:49.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bread for eating
will supply and multiply

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:53.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the seed for you to sow
and will increase the harvest

00:06:53.362 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of your righteousness.)

00:06:56.566 --> 00:07:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In everything you are being enriched

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for every sort of generosity,

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which produces through us

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an expression of thanks to God.”

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:14.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful verses.

00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:17.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why does Jehovah provide so bountifully?

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that (the words of verse 8) you
and I can be generous.

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, generosity
is an act of faith and love.

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why can it be said that generosity

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also an expression of worship?

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at how verse 11 continues:

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:37.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Generosity . . . produces through us

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:40.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an expression of thanks to God.”

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:41.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of it.

00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your generosity causes prayer,

00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is worship.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And not only that, verse 12 continues:

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:54.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because the ministry of this public service
is not only to provide well

00:07:54.824 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the needs of the holy ones
but also to be rich

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:01.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in many expressions of thanks to God.”

00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:05.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the annual meeting, we learned
about the almost $50 million (U.S.)

00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:08.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our organization
just spent on disaster relief

00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the last two service years.

00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:14.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we saw before and after photos

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the homes of some of our brothers.

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were pleased to note that our brothers

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:22.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are well cared for.

00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 12 calls that work a “ministry.”

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is sacred service, and, as such,

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:35.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it results in many expressions
of thanks to Jehovah.

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 13 continues:
“Through the proof

00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:43.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that this relief ministry gives,

00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:46.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they glorify God because you

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:49.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are submissive to the good news
about the Christ.”

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you are real Christians.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You live what you believe
“as you publicly declared,

00:08:57.753 --> 00:09:02.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and because you are generous
in your contribution to them and to all.

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:06.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And with supplication for you,
they express affection for you

00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the surpassing
undeserved kindness of God upon you.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thanks be to God

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his indescribable free gift”

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:19.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is to say, his undeserved kindness,

00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his disposition

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:26.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be generous beyond
our imagination or ability to repay.

00:09:26.349 --> 00:09:29.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the gift that enables us

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep giving.

00:09:31.687 --> 00:09:35.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day, millions of prayers of gratitude

00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ascend to Jehovah for your generosity.

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That strengthens
the bonds of our brotherhood.

00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:44.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how are you able to be generous?

00:09:44.066 --> 00:09:46.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did you get the time, the energy,

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:50.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resources, the idea, the motivation,

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love, the opportunity
to give of yourself in this way?

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:58.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us these things
through his undeserved kindness.

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:02.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you support Kingdom work,
you help those in need.

00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:05.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is worshipped,

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the words of our day’s text say
at 1 Chronicles 29:14:

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:11.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Everything is from Jehovah,
and we have given

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to him what comes from his own hand.’

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have drawn the right conclusion

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his disposition to give freely.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have trusted in his promise;

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:25.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have imitated his goodness;

00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are participating in his happiness.

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:33.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how Jehovah’s organization functions.

00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:36.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah continue to bless you richly

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your participation in that.

00:00:01 You know, a very simple way
00:00:03 to visualize Romans 12:2
00:00:05 is to use a rock and clay.
00:00:09 Now, we want to be like a rock
00:00:12 in Satan’s hands—resisting his molding.
00:00:16 But we want to be like clay
00:00:18 in Jehovah’s hands.
00:00:20 Now, being like a rock in Satan’s hand
00:00:24 really represents the first part of Romans 12:2
00:00:28 that says: “Stop being molded by this system of things.”
00:00:32 And being clay in Jehovah’s hands
00:00:35 is very similar to the thought
00:00:37 in the rest of Romans 12:2 that says
00:00:40 “Be transformed by making your mind over.”
00:00:45 Now, to illustrate the difference
00:00:48 between our reaction when Satan tries
00:00:50 to shape and mold us with this system of things
00:00:53 versus when Jehovah wants to.
00:00:55 I’d like you to think that maybe, you’re in a public place
00:00:59 —you’re at a shopping mall or someplace—
00:01:01 and a perfect stranger walks up behind you
00:01:04 and starts to massage your shoulders.
00:01:06 What would you do?
00:01:08 You would stiffen up and say: “Get away! What are you doing?”
00:01:12 But if someone you love and trust does that,
00:01:15 well, you might relax and have a very different reaction, right?
00:01:19 So, what is our reaction when Satan
00:01:23 wants to try to shape and mold us?
00:01:25 It’s being like a rock.
00:01:27 But when Jehovah wants to shape and mold us,
00:01:29 we want to be like clay.
00:01:31 Now, let’s consider one rocklike quality
00:01:35 that we need to resist Satan’s shaping and molding of us.
00:01:39 And that’s courage.
00:01:41 To start that discussion on courage,
00:01:44 let’s open our Bibles to a very straightforward,
00:01:47 simple statement at Psalm 56:3.
00:01:51 Psalm 56:3 says:
00:01:56 “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”
00:02:00 So Satan uses fear and intimidation and persecution
00:02:04 to get us to change our relationship with Jehovah,
00:02:08 to try to break our integrity, to stop us from worshipping Jehovah.
00:02:13 Now, when you read the accounts in JW News
00:02:17 about our brothers in Russia, I’m sure all of us have some reactions,
00:02:22 where you’re thinking, ‘Wow! How would I deal
00:02:25 with that kind of persecution?’
00:02:28 Or if you’re a wife, maybe you think,
00:02:31 ‘Now, how would I deal with my husband being put into prison
00:02:35 and having these kinds of things done to him?’
00:02:39 Yes, in many ways, we are very proud
00:02:42 of the courage, the rocklike qualities,
00:02:46 that our brothers are showing when Satan tries to shape and mold them.
00:02:50 I was particularly moved when I read the account
00:02:53 about the brothers and sisters in Russia in Orenburg.
00:02:57 And here a group of brothers and sisters boldly went to the prison,
00:03:01 identified themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses (at some risk of their own freedom),
00:03:05 and wanted to know how their brothers
00:03:09 were being treated in the prison.
00:03:11 Aren’t we really, truly proud of those kinds
00:03:14 of rocklike qualities that we see in our brothers and sisters?
00:03:18 But, now, it also takes courage
00:03:22 to resist other kinds of ways
00:03:24 that Satan is trying to mold and shape us.
00:03:27 It takes courage, for example, to change the channel
00:03:31 or to click the mouse away from bad entertainment.
00:03:34 Are we rocklike in that kind of courage?
00:03:37 It takes courage to face sickness or a terminal illness
00:03:42 and have the rocklike hope and strength
00:03:46 that there is going to be a resurrection.
00:03:49 It takes courage to watch the news these days
00:03:52 and see all that is going on in the world
00:03:55 and keep our rocklike courage and faith
00:03:57 that there is a new world coming
00:03:59 and that the end of this system is coming.
00:04:02 So the lesson for us is this:
00:04:04 Are we like a rock in Satan’s hands?
00:04:08 Or is it possible that we have become
00:04:10 soft and comfortable in this system of things?
00:04:14 Now, how are we doing
00:04:16 about being clay in Jehovah’s hands?
00:04:21 Isaiah 64:8
00:04:24 helps us
00:04:29 with this discussion about the clay
00:04:32 because it shows the choice that we’ve made—Isaiah 64:8.
00:04:37 It says: “But now, O Jehovah, you are our Father.
00:04:42 “We are the clay, and you are our Potter;
00:04:45 we are all the work of your hand.”
00:04:48 Now, sometimes when I’ve heard this read,
00:04:50 sometimes people say, “We are the clay, and you are the Potter.”
00:04:54 But, really, that word “our” is very important.
00:04:58 “We are the clay, and you are our  Potter.”
00:05:01 That means that we’ve made a choice
00:05:03 —that Jehovah is the one to shape and mold us.
00:05:08 Now, imagine clay that you go to shape and mold it, and it says:
00:05:12 “Ow! Hey, don’t do that! Hey, I don’t want to look like that.
00:05:16 Don’t change me like that.”
00:05:17 “OK, OK, OK.”
00:05:22 What kind of reaction are we having
00:05:24 when Jehovah is trying to shape and mold us?
00:05:28 Well, let’s consider two claylike qualities
00:05:31 that we can have when Jehovah is trying to shape and mold us.
00:05:35 First of all, obedience.
00:05:38 Now, it’s clear to all of us that Jehovah
00:05:41 is shaping and molding and preparing us
00:05:44 for the end of this system of things
00:05:47 and the events that are leading directly up to the great tribulation.
00:05:51 So will we be obedient when we get direction
00:05:55 —how to preach, how to do our meetings,
00:05:59 what assignment we may have during that turbulent time?
00:06:03 You know, yesterday Brother Splane
00:06:05 made some excellent comments about King Solomon.
00:06:07 Now, King Solomon had some divine instruction,
00:06:10 but he ignored it, and he basically said,
00:06:13 ‘Well, you know, I can marry lots of foreign wives,
00:06:15 and it’s not going to have any effect on me.’
00:06:17 We don’t want to have that kind of attitude when it comes to divine instruction.
00:06:21 Or we could be like an athlete who hires a coach,
00:06:25 pays him lots of money, and says, “What can I do to be better?”
00:06:29 And the athlete says: “Well, you know, I’m the professional athlete.
00:06:32 I really don’t need to listen to what you have to say.”
00:06:35 So Jehovah is giving us counsel and advice.
00:06:38 We want to listen.
00:06:40 For example, this virus that is spreading around
00:06:43 is giving us an opportunity to see about being obedient.
00:06:47 We have many rules or guidelines that are being set for us.
00:06:51 We may be quarantined.
00:06:53 We may have trips and other things canceled.
00:06:56 We may be told to wash our hands
00:07:00 or to not shake hands, but elbow bump.
00:07:03 Now, of course, we can try hard
00:07:07 to be obedient to those rules and guidelines,
00:07:10 but we also have an opportunity to not just be obedient
00:07:14 to rules and guidelines
00:07:16 but be obedient to the principles behind them.
00:07:19 And in this case, often the principle is love of neighbor.
00:07:23 We’re trying to look out for others
00:07:25 with these rules and guidelines when it comes to the virus.
00:07:29 And, really, when you think about it,
00:07:31 any of the opportunities we have now
00:07:33 are a time to practice being obedient.
00:07:37 Really, view it as training for us.
00:07:40 We have an opportunity to practice being obedient for the future.
00:07:45 It’s at times like these that we can set a pattern of obedience,
00:07:49 because with time and effort and practice,
00:07:53 we can make obedience our first reaction
00:07:56 rather than a second reaction.
00:08:00 Well, what’s another claylike quality that we could have?
00:08:04 It’s spiritual focus.
00:08:07 Today, Jehovah is making it perfectly clear that we’re living in the last days.
00:08:12 Now, the people of Noah’s time,
00:08:14 “they took no note” of the time they were living in.
00:08:16 They didn’t have that claylike quality, and they were swept away.
00:08:20 I saw a video recently of an athlete doing a track meet.
00:08:25 They were running a race around the track,
00:08:27 and when this one athlete crossed the finish line,
00:08:29 he threw his hands up and he was absolutely jubilant that he had won the race.
00:08:34 But then he didn’t see anybody cheering for him,
00:08:36 and the rest of the runners were running.
00:08:38 He was too early. There was one more lap to go.
00:08:43 Well, he lost track of where he was.
00:08:48 He didn’t know that that wasn’t the last lap.
00:08:52 Well, we don’t want to lose track
00:08:55 of where we are in the race for life,
00:08:58 being so busy with doing other things.
00:09:02 Let the fact that we’re living in the last of the last days
00:09:06 influence our day-to-day decisions.
00:09:10 Become claylike, moldable —we’re living in the last days.
00:09:14 Pay attention to the Bible principles
00:09:17 that are mentioned to us in The Watchtower  and our meetings
00:09:20 and have good spiritual conversations.
00:09:22 And those conversations can help to remind us
00:09:25 of the time in which we’re living.
00:09:27 So the lesson for us is this:
00:09:29 You have chosen Jehovah to be your Potter.
00:09:34 So be good, obedient,
00:09:36 spiritually-focused clay in his hands.
00:09:40 Yes, we need to be like a rock in Satan’s hands,
00:09:44 and we need to be like clay in Jehovah’s hands.

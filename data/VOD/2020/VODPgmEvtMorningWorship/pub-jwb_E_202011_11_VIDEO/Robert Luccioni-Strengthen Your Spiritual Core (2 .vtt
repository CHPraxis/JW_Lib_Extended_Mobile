00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:04.187 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How strong is your core?

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:06.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, health experts will tell you 

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:07.691 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the core is

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.092 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one of the most important groups

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:10.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of muscles that you can strengthen.

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:12.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
These are the muscles

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that are in the trunk of the body

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:16.066 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from somewhere around the neck to the waist.

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a strong core will keep
you standing if something knocks against you.

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:25.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having a strong core
will allow you to carry a heavy weight.

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you fall, a strong core

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:30.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you to get back up on your feet.

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thus, experts say
that exercises that strengthen the core,

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these foundational muscles, are so important,

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for older people.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how strong is your core?

00:00:43.193 --> 00:00:46.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the real question
we want to consider today is,

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How strong is your spiritual core

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our spiritual foundational muscles?

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we see the importance
of having a strong spiritual core

00:00:56.206 --> 00:01:00.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we look at today’s text
in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look up verse 6,
here the apostle Paul is talking

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:06.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about wicked “men who slyly work their way

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into households” and deceive many.

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At verse 8, he talks about “Jannes
and Jambres [who] opposed Moses.”

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were wicked men,
“completely corrupted in mind,”

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who tried to discredit everything
that Moses said and did.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, as we see in today’s text,
Paul said that “wicked men and impostors”

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:30.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would arise in the last days
and they would “advance from bad to worse.”

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:33.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Paul say would help Timothy?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he need to do?

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He needed a strong spiritual core.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that?

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look what he says
in verses 14 and 15—2 Timothy 3.

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “You, however,
continue in the things that you learned 

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were persuaded to believe,
knowing from whom you learned them

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that from infancy
you have known the holy writings,

00:01:55.765 --> 00:02:00.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are able to make you wise
for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.”

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the two things?

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one: He needed to have
a deep understanding

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:08.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trust of “the holy writings,”
the Scriptures.

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And two: He needed to never forget,
to remember,

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:15.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from whom he learned
all the good things that he knew.

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:17.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, he needed to make sure that was solid.

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:20.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would help him to deal
with the wicked men

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and impostors.

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this solid, spiritual foundation

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what also helped Jesus’ apostles.

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:33.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the tactics
that the wicked men and imposters

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used against Jesus and how this 
could have affected the apostles

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or affected us, if we had been there.

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider four tactics
that they used against Jesus.

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:46.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
They used lies and misrepresentation.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:51.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn back, if you will,
to Matthew 11:9 as an example

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 11:19, excuse me.

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:57.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 11:19—it says:

00:02:57.293 --> 00:02:59.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Son of man did come
eating and drinking, but people say, 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! A man who is a glutton
and is given to drinking wine,

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’”

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Jesus like to eat and drink?

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:15.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he, in fact,
eat with tax collectors and sinners?

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what
the wicked men and imposters did?

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:22.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They stretched it to say, 
‘Well, you see, he’s a glutton;

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s a drunkard; he is a friend 
of tax collectors and sinners.’

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Luke 15:2;

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it even kind of insinuates
that he condones their behavior

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even shares in their sins.

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you were there?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now, we know he likes to eat and drink,

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘but I’m not with him 24 hours a day.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:43.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope that’s not true.’

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see how
that could plant seeds of doubt?

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how it could rock somebody?

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:52.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second tactic: Wicked men
and imposters would also twist Jesus’ words.

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at John 5:18 as an example.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:18—it says:

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is why the Jews
began seeking all the more to kill him,

00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because not only was he breaking the Sabbath

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he was also calling God his own Father,

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:12.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making himself equal to God.”

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here they twist Jesus’ words,

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:17.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that Jesus was saying
that he was “equal to God.”

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus never said that he was equal to God.

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:23.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he was God’s Son;
he said: “The Father is greater than I am.”

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they constantly took Jesus’ words
and repackaged them,

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
twisting them to make it sound like
Jesus was off on his own.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what if you heard
that story told and retold?

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You didn’t hear the conversation,

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:39.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you heard the story;
you heard the sound bite.

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wow!
Did he really say that?

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now, that would be out of line if he had,

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:46.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because nobody is equal to God.’

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also capitalized
on errors that were made.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:51.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look over to Luke chapter 9.

00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember,
this is the account when the disciples

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not cast out
the demon in the young man.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you look at verse 40.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the father says
—Luke 9:40—

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “‘I begged your disciples
to expel it, but they could not.’

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:09.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In response Jesus said:
‘O faithless and twisted generation,

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘how long must I continue
with you and put up with you?

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring your son over here.’”

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we know,
apparently the scribes were criticizing

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the disciples because
of their failure to heal the boy.

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:23.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, again, what if you were standing there?

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you saw this one with your own eyes?

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wait a minute, those are Jesus’ disciples.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s their commission.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s what they’re supposed to do.

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps these people
aren’t as special as I thought they were.’

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wicked men and impostors

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would also inflame statements
that people did not understand.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at John 6:54.

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:47.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember here when Jesus said:

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever feeds on my flesh
and drinks my blood has everlasting life,

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will resurrect him on the last day.”

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the reaction?

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look at verse 60:

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they heard this,
many of the disciples said:

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This speech is shocking;
who can listen to it?’”

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 66:
“[They] went off to the things behind

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:06.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would no longer [follow] him.”

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, rather than giving it time
to see if they understood it correctly

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or waiting to see if maybe Jesus clarified
the statement, it knocked them.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you notice (in verse 52)
the Jews further stirred this up,

00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of that,
many stopped following him.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was too heavy for them to carry.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what if you were there,
and this time you heard Jesus say that?

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Whoa!
Man, that’s odd!

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t think I can explain that teaching.

00:06:33.843 --> 00:06:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He seems to be getting
more and more extreme.’

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how did many react to these attacks?

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the crowds loved to follow Jesus.

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They loved to hear his winsome words.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No man has ever spoken like this.’

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:51.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thousands would come to be fed
by him and to be healed by him,

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the end,
most did not stick with Jesus.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:59.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because when you strip
all the other peripherals away,

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the other extras away,

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it came down to their faith in Bible prophecy

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:08.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that this man
that was speaking to them

00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the Son of God.

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their spiritual core was not strong enough.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus’ disciples
had a strong spiritual core.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, even though they did get knocked down

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they got confused at times—
they stayed solid.

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were able to get back up.
Why?

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they recalled the Scriptures,

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:30.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were convinced
that they were listening to the Son of God.

00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today, wicked men and imposters
use exactly the same techniques.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s only going to get worse.

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:41.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They use lies and misrepresentation.

00:07:41.844 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They lie about how we deal with child abusers

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:47.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we care
for the victims of child abuse.

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They twist statements
that are made regarding our stand on blood,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyalty to families, disfellowshipping.

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They capitalize on what
they perceive as errors

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:59.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps dogmatic statements
we made in the past

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:03.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding a Bible prophecy
or our understanding of the time of the end,

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:05.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we later changed it.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also put a negative spin
on changes that they do not understand

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:14.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—why we simplified
and did reassignments in 2015,

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:19.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
new explanations of the generation,
or changes at world headquarters.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:21.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the result?
Well, some are swayed by these things.

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re stumbled; they’re knocked down.

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s too heavy for them to carry.

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about us?

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:32.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How strong is our spiritual core?

00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that’s why we hear repeatedly

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:38.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must personally have a regular,

00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deep study of the Scriptures.

00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:44.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why
we’re reminded repeatedly that Jehovah

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:48.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is using the Governing Body
to give us the good things that we have.

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that so important?

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because one day we may hit a time,

00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether personally
(in our personal life) or as an organization,

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when all the other spiritual peripherals
are gone—all the extras.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we do then?

00:09:06.162 --> 00:09:11.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we do, for example,
if the lights go out on JW Broadcasting®?

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:14.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens, perhaps, when we
don’t have the incredible conventions,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the touching videos, the catchy music,

00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beautifully-written
(well-written) <i>Watchtower</i>  articles,

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exciting annual meetings?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re gone.

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:26.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, some of our brothers
and sisters do not have access

00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:28.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those things right now.

00:09:28.084 --> 00:09:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you see, at that time,
it will come down to our faith

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is God’s Word

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:38.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Governing Body
is the channel that Jehovah has been using.

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during this period of relative calm,

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we follow the advice of the apostle Paul

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:46.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:14, 15

00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and know “the holy writings” inside and out

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remember from whom we’ve learned
all the good things that we know.

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:58.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s our spiritual core
—strengthen it; maintain it.

00:09:58.047 --> 00:10:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will stabilize us, and it will help us

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get through the things
that are yet to come.

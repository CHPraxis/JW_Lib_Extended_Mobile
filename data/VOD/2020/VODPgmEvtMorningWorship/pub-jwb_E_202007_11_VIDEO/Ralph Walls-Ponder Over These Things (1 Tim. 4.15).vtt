<i>The Watchtower</i>  from which our comments

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.358 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are taken is November 2018,

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:10.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the theme of the article was

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:11.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Making

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:13.663 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Thoughts Your Own?”

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.498 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a deep subject

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for imperfect humans

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make Jehovah’s thoughts our own.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme text is Romans 12:2.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might want to look at that.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a powerful verse.

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:29.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There Paul wrote:

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop being molded by this system of things,

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then, on the other side of it]

00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but be transformed

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by making your mind over,

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:46.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may prove to yourselves

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good and acceptable
and perfect will of God.”

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s he saying?

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:56.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, he’s telling us 
to let God’s thoughts become ours.

00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting because,
in spite of the great advancement

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in technology and in higher education,

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at the world’s wisdom
and what it’s produced

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—injustice, unrest,
illicit sex, abuse of drugs.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could go on and on
about the disastrous consequences

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that’s produced.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians reminds us in chapter 1

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:27.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “a foolish thing of God
is wiser than men,

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a weak thing of God
is stronger than men.”

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:35.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a principle,
and we all believe that.

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that means that every one of us
has a personal responsibility

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:44.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work at being transformed

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to fight against
being molded by the world.

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:54.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul’s inspired admonition
is very direct.

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t say, ‘You may have to, you know,

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sort of look at this carefully and stop.’

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says to us, ‘Stop it!’

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:07.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop being molded by this system of things.”

00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we have to be determined

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to transform our minds
from human thinking to Jehovah’s.

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:17.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we have to acknowledge
that the fact is that we’re all influenced

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to some degree
by the spirit of the world.

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:22.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to fight that.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have our own imperfect inclination.

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:27.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes determination.

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what he says there
as far as transformation is profound.

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It touches every fiber of our thinking,

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our innermost attitudes,
our feelings, our inclinations

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things within us that no one else knows.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good for each one of us
to ask ourselves from time to time:

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:51.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Are the changes that I’m making

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘only skin-deep,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘what people can see,

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:59.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or am I making adjustments deep within?

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is my mind influenced

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘more by my culture
than by Jehovah’s thinking?

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is my heart more influenced
because I’m American,

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:13.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Canadian, Russian, British, Spanish,

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘black, white (whatever), Asian

00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:20.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than by being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?’

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s easy to say,
“I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:27.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not so easy to feel

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the impact of that claim

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:34.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the depths
of our minds and our hearts.

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:38.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s nothing wrong
with being pleased with our culture

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of the traditions
that come along with it.

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:44.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s evident that Jehovah loves diversity,

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s a beautiful thing
in the human family.

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:51.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that should not determine
our attitude toward others

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our general line of thought.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most importantly,

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it shouldn’t diminish our determination

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reflect Jehovah’s way of thinking 

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:07.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than cultural
or this system of things.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, where we have to be careful

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when we’re studying.

00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:16.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us were raised in the truth,
others were not,

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we all know that we have
to work to rid our minds of bad things.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something that we do,

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it doesn’t stop there.

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:28.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we only rid our minds of bad things,

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jesus, in Matthew chapter 12,
shows what could happen.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew chapter 12,

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:39.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 43-45,

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what he says:

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When an unclean spirit comes out of a man,

00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it passes through waterless places

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in search of a resting-place

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and finds none.

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then it says, ‘I will go back
to my house from which I moved,’

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:06.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and on arriving,
it finds the house unoccupied

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:11.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[that is, of bad things]
but swept clean and adorned.”

00:05:11.494 --> 00:05:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice: “Then it goes
and takes along with it

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“seven different spirits more wicked

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than itself,

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:24.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and after getting inside, they dwell there;

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:27.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the final circumstances of that man

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:30.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become worse than the first.”

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the thought?

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:36.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to keep pondering,

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking deeply,

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditating,
filling our minds on the things of God.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, we can fall into the same snare

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those of the world do, even unwittingly.

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:53.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we can really fall

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:56.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a dangerous position

00:05:56.406 --> 00:06:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is described at 1 Timothy 4:1,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he calls out the world.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says that it’s being misled

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by “inspired statements
and teachings of demons.”

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And never before have people
been so completely deluged

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:18.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with emotionally charged

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and misleading and distracting information.

00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:26.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You turn on the news—it’s hot with anger,

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unrest,

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lack of unity.

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But pondering on Jehovah’s counsel

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:37.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
safeguards us from falling victim
—inside—

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “misleading inspired utterances
and teachings of demons.”

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:44.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a very interesting thought

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highlights the need
for meditation on God’s Word.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me
or go to your iPads, your devices,

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Psalm 119,

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:59.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verses 10, 11,

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:03.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice it says: “With my whole heart

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[my whole heart] I seek you.

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not let me stray from your commandments.”

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 11: “In my heart

00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I treasure up your saying

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I may not sin against you.”

00:07:20.623 --> 00:07:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we constantly hear reminders

00:07:23.493 --> 00:07:28.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the value
of really meditating on God’s Word.

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember our midweek meeting part:

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep Feeding on Jehovah’s Reminders”

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the video with Brother Jackson,
<i>Treasure Jehovah’s Reminders</i>

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:40.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something we should consider

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:42.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditating on even further.

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One final thought:

00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look with me at a prayer that’s likely

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of ours at Isaiah 64:8

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:54.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 64:8 says:

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now, O Jehovah,

00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you are our Father.

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:05.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are the clay, and you are our Potter,

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are all the work of your hand.”

That’s something; that’s a privilege.

To make fine quality pottery,

00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a potter uses high-grade clay.

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s you, because Jehovah
has picked out the precious things.

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are two things that he needs to do.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, the clay needs to be washed

00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remove any foreign material
or contamination.

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:37.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, the clay must be mixed
with the right amount of water

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:40.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked so that it will retain its shape

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after being molded under pressure.

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So water is used both
in the cleansing of the clay

00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in giving it the right consistency.

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:53.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s similar with God’s Word in us.

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:56.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah works on us

00:08:56.686 --> 00:09:01.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we meditate and ponder on his Word.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible helps us
to rid ourselves of impurities

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and transforms us
into something valuable to Jehovah.

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a privilege it is to be associated
with the valuable things of Jehovah!

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bethel family worldwide is a microcosm

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a beautiful brotherhood
that Jehovah is shaping.

00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:23.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may all of us be determined

00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:25.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ponder over the thoughts of God

00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:28.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to resist the influence of the world.

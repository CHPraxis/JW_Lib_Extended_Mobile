00:00:01 What would you say
00:00:03 is the biggest single emotion
00:00:06 gripping people today?
00:00:08 Well, many would readily agree
00:00:10 that it’s fear.
00:00:12 Interestingly, in 1982, the book
00:00:15 You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth said this:
00:00:18 “Fear is probably the biggest single emotion
00:00:23 in people’s lives today.”
00:00:26 And that comment by “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:00:28 was based on Jesus’ words
00:00:30 in giving us a sign about the last days.
00:00:34 You know that in addition to wars, earthquakes,
00:00:38 food shortages, and epidemics,
00:00:41 at Luke 21:11, the Bible tells us
00:00:44 that Jesus included “fearful sights,”
00:00:47 or “terrifying events,” as indicated in the Study Bible.
00:00:52 At Luke 21:26,
00:00:54 do you recall the emotion that Jesus said would overwhelm God’s enemies
00:00:59 as they looked ahead in the near future
00:01:02 to seeing the sign of “the Son of man”?
00:01:05 It would be fear.
00:01:07 Jesus said: “People will become faint out of fear
00:01:12 and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”
00:01:17 Well, what about us as Jehovah’s people?
00:01:20 As a group, we are nowhere near
00:01:24 being “faint out of fear,”
00:01:26 nor will we be as things worsen
00:01:30 as we approach the great tribulation.
00:01:32 Why not?
00:01:34 Simply put, it’s because Jehovah has prepared us
00:01:38 to remain calm
00:01:40 when bad things happen in the world or in our personal lives.
00:01:44 Think about one way Jehovah prepared us
00:01:47 for the year 2020.
00:01:50 It was by giving us in the year 2019
00:01:53 the yeartext at Isaiah 41:10.
00:01:58 In our study of that yeartext last year,
00:02:01 we were reminded that a key to not giving way to fear
00:02:05 is to meditate on the three faith-building promises
00:02:09 contained in Isaiah 41:10.
00:02:12 Look at it again, please, in Examining the Scriptures.
00:02:16 Do you see the three promises?
00:02:18 First, Jehovah will be with us;
00:02:22 second, he is our God;
00:02:24 and third, he will help us.
00:02:28 This morning, to illustrate
00:02:31 the reliability of those three guarantees,
00:02:34 we’ll consider some delightful experiences.
00:02:37 To begin, consider, please,
00:02:40 the experience of a sister we’ll call Anna
00:02:42 who is in prison for her faith.
00:02:46 Anna’s cellmate noticed
00:02:48 that Anna was not able to reply
00:02:50 to all the letters of encouragement that she was receiving.
00:02:54 When this experience was compiled last November,
00:02:57 do you know how many letters our sister had received?
00:03:01 More than 1,700.
00:03:04 So her cellmate in a friendly way
00:03:07 offered to be Anna’s secretary.
00:03:10 According to Anna, this cellmate agreed
00:03:12 that she would read each letter very carefully
00:03:14 and then consult with Anna about how to respond.
00:03:18 She became so good at the job
00:03:20 that she even would respond to letters by herself.
00:03:25 Well, Anna’s circumstances in prison were not ideal.
00:03:30 One day, a prison guard conducted an inspection of the cell
00:03:34 and asked Anna to give him her Bible.
00:03:38 She begged him not to take it away,
00:03:41 but he did anyway.
00:03:43 Anna started to cry.
00:03:46 Then something unexpected happened.
00:03:48 Surprisingly, Anna’s other cellmates
00:03:51 started making a lot of noise and began beating on the cell doors
00:03:55 demanding that the Bible be returned immediately to Anna.
00:03:59 They told the guard, “To Anna the Bible
00:04:02 is more important than food”
00:04:04 because they had regularly seen her reading that Bible.
00:04:08 Eventually, the guard returned the Bible to our sister.
00:04:13 Later, Anna confronted another test in jail.
00:04:16 Two of the prisoners in her cell were in jail for criminal activity,
00:04:21 and they were singing Gypsy songs one day
00:04:25 about their criminal life.
00:04:27 Even though our sister did not completely understand
00:04:30 the language they were using,
00:04:32 she suspected that their singing
00:04:35 included some vulgar speech.
00:04:38 Immediately, Anna prayed to Jehovah
00:04:40 and asked that he correct the situation.
00:04:43 And again, something unexpected happened.
00:04:46 Suddenly, one of the Gypsy women began singing one of our Kingdom songs.
00:04:50 Anna was shocked.
00:04:52 She asked, “How do you know this song?”
00:04:54 And then Anna joined her in finishing the song.
00:04:58 As it turned out, this Gypsy woman’s mother
00:05:01 had studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:05:04 and during that time her daughter who is now in prison
00:05:07 had memorized the Kingdom song.
00:05:10 Anna said that this experience was proof
00:05:14 that Jehovah responds very quickly to prayers
00:05:16 and that he can even use non-Witnesses to encourage his servants.
00:05:22 Well, brothers and sisters, in thinking about the promise
00:05:25 in Isaiah 41:10,
00:05:27 can there be any doubt
00:05:29 that Jehovah is with Anna
00:05:32 and with all of our imprisoned brothers and sisters at this time?
00:05:37 Even when cut off from family and friends,
00:05:40 Jehovah gives his servants his full affection
00:05:44 and attention.
00:05:47 A second experience received last July
00:05:50 highlights the fact that Jehovah is our God,
00:05:53 the second assurance in Isaiah 41:10.
00:05:57 A brother we will call Peter reported this, and I quote:
00:06:01 “During the first few months of imprisonment, I was placed in solitary confinement.
00:06:06 “I felt downhearted and began to dream of a shepherding visit.
00:06:11 “I thought about how good it would be
00:06:13 “to talk with two brothers in ties.
00:06:16 “I had heard that in some congregations when someone received a shepherding visit,
00:06:20 “they would say, after the fact, that ‘the ties’ came to visit me.
00:06:25 “I too wanted such a visit, so I prayed:
00:06:29 “‘Jehovah, I understand that this is practically impossible now,
00:06:33 but I want “the ties” to come visit me.’”
00:06:38 Peter goes on to state:
00:06:40 “After a short time, I received a letter with a card.
00:06:45 “The card was made in the form of
00:06:47 a pink shirt with a yellow tie.”
00:06:50 You’ll see it on the monitors.
00:06:52 “In the card,” Peter said,
00:06:54 “were the words from the song Shepherds—Gifts in Men,
00:06:59 our song 103.”
00:07:03 Brothers and sisters, can you imagine how Peter felt at that moment?
00:07:07 How did he view Jehovah?
00:07:10 He continues: “This was the answer to my prayer.
00:07:13 “A real shepherding visit.
00:07:15 “This encouraged me more than I could have imagined.
00:07:18 “It was one of the best days during that difficult time.
00:07:22 “With tears, I thanked Jehovah for his support.
00:07:25 “I saw tangible evidence of Jehovah’s care for my emotional needs.
00:07:29 I will keep this card as a treasured memento.”
00:07:34 Well, do we see how Jehovah proved true to that second assurance?
00:07:38 “I am your God.”
00:07:40 Jehovah answered Peter’s need
00:07:42 in an unexpected but very tender way.
00:07:46 In discussing this part of Isaiah 41:10,
00:07:49 The Watchtower acknowledged that now more than ever
00:07:52 we need to remember who is in control.
00:07:55 People around us are in fear because so many things seem out of control.
00:08:00 And while we’re affected by the same problems that affect other people,
00:08:04 we know, based on Jehovah’s assurances,
00:08:07 that there’s no need for us to be afraid.
00:08:11 The problems people face today
00:08:13 are like the strong winds that might rock an airplane during flight.
00:08:16 Some passengers naturally panic.
00:08:19 But why do we remain calm?
00:08:22 Because we know who our pilot is.
00:08:25 It is Jehovah our God.
00:08:30 Let’s consider one more experience that connects well with Isaiah 41:10,
00:08:34 where Jehovah says: “I will help you.”
00:08:37 In Illinois, we have a dear anointed sister
00:08:40 by the name of Antonia, who is 90 years old.
00:08:43 She is homebound and does not have a mobile device
00:08:46 nor access to the Internet.
00:08:48 Due to the pandemic, she was very nervous about
00:08:51 being home alone last week for the Memorial.
00:08:54 So how did Jehovah help Antonia?
00:08:57 The congregation worked out a plan
00:09:00 so that she could observe the Memorial with another sister present
00:09:03 without risking their health.
00:09:05 Patty, a close friend, offered to assist Antonia
00:09:09 if it would be safe to do so.
00:09:11 So a doctor was consulted, and he provided detailed instructions
00:09:15 that would keep both sisters safe,
00:09:18 which included the use of gloves and masks
00:09:20 and sanitizing the plate and the cup that would be used for the emblems.
00:09:25 When the plan was presented to our sister Antonia,
00:09:28 she was asked if she would like Patty to assist.
00:09:32 She replied, “With all my heart.”
00:09:36 So our two sisters listened together
00:09:39 to the Memorial talk last week.
00:09:41 Antonia partook of the emblems with tears in her eyes.
00:09:45 With heartfelt emotion she said,
00:09:48 “I pray to Jehovah to help me
00:09:50 stay worthy and faithful.”
00:09:54 Brothers and sisters, these true-to-life experiences
00:09:57 are heartwarming, aren’t they?
00:10:00 And what Jehovah has done for Anna, Peter, and Antonia
00:10:05 proves what The Watchtower said, and I quote:
00:10:08 “No force in the universe can make Jehovah abandon his love
00:10:12 for those who serve him; his loyalty to us is unshakable.”
00:10:19 Well, would you like to strengthen your confidence in Jehovah,
00:10:22 our God and our Father?
00:10:24 Today, why not meditate deeply on Isaiah 41:10?
00:10:28 If possible, commit those verses to memory.
00:10:32 And let’s keep working to get to know Jehovah better
00:10:36 by regularly reading
00:10:38 the Bible carefully and meditating on what we read.
00:10:41 Then, as we face trials together,
00:10:44 we’ll move ahead with full confidence that Jehovah is with us.
00:10:48 We’ll do so with faith, not fear.

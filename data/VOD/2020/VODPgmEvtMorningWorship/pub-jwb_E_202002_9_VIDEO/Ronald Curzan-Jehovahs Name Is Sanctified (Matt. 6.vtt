Have you ever asked a child,

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:05.188 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Where’s Jehovah?”

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:07.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Right away their finger goes up.

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:08.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s cute.

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:09.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate that their parents

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:10.660 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have taught them

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
some very basic things,

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.763 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s name as well.

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But what if we were to ask

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same question to an adult,
“Where’s Jehovah?”

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they put their hand up

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not so cute.

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:24.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is really deeper than that.

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:26.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question,
Where is Jehovah?

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is really,
‘Where is Jehovah in my life?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where is Jehovah
when I’m making decisions?

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What is his will?

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:37.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would he like for me to do?’

00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:42.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the question:
‘Where is Jehovah in my life?’

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s basically what Jesus Christ
was saying in the model prayer.

00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:48.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There would be a priority in things

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:51.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would request
of our heavenly Father.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:54.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were to put
our own interests first, our concerns,

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:58.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would really be
out of the priority that he outlined.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the sanctification of Jehovah’s name
—which is number one—

00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then his Kingdom,
as well as Jehovah’s will.

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was here on earth,
there was no question

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he put Jehovah first in his life.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he did,
everything he said,

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:20.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he treated others
all revolved around Jehovah’s sanctification.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus not only gave the model prayer

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he lived the model prayer.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He worked in perfect harmony
with that prayer,

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he instructed his followers
to do the same

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—always try to put Jehovah
as the number one thing in their life

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in small decisions
as well as the large decisions.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he gave the model prayer

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as something for us to follow as a model,

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a guide, not word for word,

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:55.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the thoughts and the order
of importance within that prayer.

00:01:55.431 --> 00:02:00.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Jesus was so concerned
about sanctifying Jehovah’s name

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he did this on a regular basis,

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminding his closest associates how to pray.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the proper things to pray for?

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote on Matthew 6:9
is interesting for “be sanctified.”

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It defines it as “be held sacred;

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be treated as holy.”

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really helps us to understand
what sanctification means.

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our <i>Study Bible</i>  really helps us,

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as this point is put in a comment.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says this in the <i>Study Bible: </i>

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is a petition that all creation,

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:37.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“including both humans and angels,

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“hold God’s name holy.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The petition also includes
the thought that God take action

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to sanctify himself
by clearing his name of the reproach

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that has been heaped on it
ever since the rebellion

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the first human pair
in the garden of Eden.”

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, toward the end of Jesus’ ministry,

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could confidently
and humbly approach Jehovah

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say at John 17:26:

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:06.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have made your name known to them

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will make it known [to them].”

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the words
that we want to say as well

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we follow Jesus, our model.

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:20.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s no question, again,
that Jesus put Jehovah first.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a priority.

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sanctification of His name
was number one.

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:27.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To sanctify God’s name,

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you and for me,
is more than just words.

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than what we say in our prayer.

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s what we do, what we put into action.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to ask ourselves
on a daily basis,

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:45.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where is Jehovah in my life
when I’m making decisions

00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:50.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how I treat others
and how I serve Jehovah?’

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:53.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah must be
very happy when he looks down

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:55.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at all those who
are tied in to this program

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how they (you)
are putting Jehovah first.

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are simplifying your lives.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re sanctifying his name
by your work assignments,

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:08.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation, in your actions,
and in your thoughts.

00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of us have been serving Jehovah

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many years, many decades.

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:15.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we must continue to ask,

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where’s Jehovah in my life?’

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making wise decisions,

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:22.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we have
many years of faithful service.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem
with Jehovah’s people in the past,

00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his people, Israel,

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:29.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that they were supposed to be holy.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were supposed to be sanctified,
set apart to do his will.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many times, they did their own will.

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:38.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what the prophet Jeremiah
had to say on this subject

00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:43.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 2:5, 6,

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:47.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the question that was posed
by Jeremiah to those people.

00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 2:5 says:

00:04:50.673 --> 00:04:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says:

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What fault did your forefathers find in me,

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so that they strayed so far from me,

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they walked after worthless idols

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and became worthless themselves?

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[This is the point.]

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:07.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not ask,
“Where is Jehovah?”’”

00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a simple question but profound.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice verse 8:

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Even] the priests

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:17.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[who were supposed to be
holy, leading the people, they] did not ask,

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Where is Jehovah?’

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:21.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those handling the Law did not know me,

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the shepherds rebelled against me,

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the prophets prophesied by Baal,

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they followed those
who could bring no benefit.”

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was not part of their lives.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were doing
their own will, not Jehovah’s.

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:39.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s one thing
to follow Jehovah’s direction

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:42.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do his will
when things are going well,

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:45.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things are going
as we have anticipated,

00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what about when
difficulties come upon us

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—trialsome situations?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then here comes the test.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of God’s servants
throughout the centuries

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have proved their integrity
and their faithfulness

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite whatever
has been thrown against them.

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of a Bible character
that had so much against him

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so many trials,
so many depressing situations—

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet he was very faithful?

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you thinking about Job?

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s one of the characters
that we refer to many, many times.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Job was a faithful man.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know the end of the story.

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But throughout his ordeals,

00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was really tested and he lost focus.

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became shortsighted;
he became self-absorbed.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:36.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a way, he replaced
all the windows in his home

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with mirrors so that all he
could see was himself.

00:06:39.582 --> 00:06:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All he could see were his own problems.

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah used
the young man Elihu

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:46.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind Job that he needed

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at things
from a different perspective.

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Job chapter 35

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:55.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Job 35:9.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elihu said:

00:07:01.637 --> 00:07:04.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“People cry out
when under great oppression;

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they cry for relief
from the domination of the powerful.

00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:11.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no one says,
‘Where is God, my Grand Maker?’”

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:16.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he was trying to, really,
remind him of the big picture

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—looking at things
from Jehovah’s standpoint.

00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he helped Job remove those mirrors

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he could look out his windows

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—see Jehovah; see the big picture;

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see his smallness
in comparison to Jehovah’s largeness.

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if you go to Job chapter 42,

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice there his response
as he was readjusted

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humbly listened to these reminders.

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 42:3, he said:

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:45.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I spoke, but without understanding.”

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 5:
“My ears have heard about you,

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but now I do see you with my eyes.

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:53.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why I take back what I said,

00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:56.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I repent in dust and ashes.”

00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:01.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job’s experience is something
that we may have experienced

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:05.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some kind of trial,
some kind of discouraging experience.

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a very close friend of mine

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who came into Bethel
around the same time as myself.

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got married around the same time,

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, unfortunately,
he lost his wife in death

00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few years ago.

00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that very month, what did he do?

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he get depressed?
Did he quit?

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He auxiliary pioneered.

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I spoke to him and asked him,

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:30.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How could you have
such a focus, such a determination?”

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:32.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said:
“Well, I looked at it this way:

00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul said that we are

00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘a theatrical spectacle
before men and angels.’

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I view myself
as this is my ‘Job moment.’

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:44.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So here I am.
I’m thrust onto the stage.

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:47.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Up in that balcony is Jehovah, Jesus,

00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:50.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the resurrected anointed ones, the angels.

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:51.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They’re looking down at me,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there before me in the audience

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the world
and my brothers and my sisters.

00:08:57.086 --> 00:09:01.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And down in that orchestra pit
is Satan the Devil and the demons.

00:09:01.324 --> 00:09:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here I am. Lights are on.

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:04.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone is looking at me.

00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:08.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What am I going to do?
Will I run? Will I hide?

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:10.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or is this my ‘Job moment’?

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this where I prove my integrity?”

00:09:12.268 --> 00:09:15.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did, and he continues to do so today.

00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:17.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about us?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re going
through discouraging circumstances

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our “Job moment”—

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:25.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we ask, Where is Jehovah?

00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we proving our integrity
by what we’re doing

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—promoting Kingdom interests,
sanctifying Jehovah’s name?

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that the number one thing in our life?

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:36.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we doing that daily?

00:09:36.092 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to ask ourselves
that on a daily basis.

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when we’re giving talks,

00:09:40.863 --> 00:09:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re dealing
with brothers and sisters

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:44.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at work or in a congregation,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to ask,
Where is Jehovah?

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:51.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will really change
our treatment of others,

00:09:51.207 --> 00:09:54.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we view them,
and how we view ourselves.

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:57.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus’ reminders
really help us to appreciate

00:09:57.713 --> 00:10:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there’s a priority in what we pray for

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we carry out those prayers

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:06.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—always putting Jehovah
as the number one thing in our life,

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:08.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that all of our other requests,

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our personal requests,
will be heard by Jehovah

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be answered by him.

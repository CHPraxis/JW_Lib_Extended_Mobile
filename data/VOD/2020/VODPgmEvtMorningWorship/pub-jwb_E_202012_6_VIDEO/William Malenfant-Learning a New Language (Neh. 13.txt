00:00:01 Usually,
00:00:02 the language that we learned
00:00:04 from infancy becomes
00:00:06 the language of the heart,
00:00:08 and we learn it at home.
00:00:12 In most cases, the dominant influence
00:00:14 in our life in connection with our language of the heart,
00:00:17 or the first language, is our mother.
00:00:20 And that’s precisely what took place
00:00:23 in Israel in the days of Nehemiah.
00:00:26 But the mothers in this case were pagans
00:00:29 sharing their language and probably their beliefs with their children.
00:00:34 And a lot of Jewish men —prominent Jewish men—
00:00:37 had married pagan women.
00:00:39 Let’s read the scripture together
00:00:42 at Nehemiah 13:23, 24
00:00:49 —Nehemiah 13:23, 24.
00:00:53 It says: “In those days I also saw Jews
00:00:57 “who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite,
00:01:00 “and Moabite women.
00:01:02 “Half of their sons were speaking Ashdodite
00:01:05 “and half spoke the language of the different peoples,
00:01:08 “but none of them
00:01:10 knew how to speak the language of the Jews.”
00:01:15 And as was stated, it’s very likely that those mothers
00:01:19 would be teaching the children
00:01:21 about their land, their culture,
00:01:24 their worship, and the pagan gods they worshipped.
00:01:27 And so the decision was made
00:01:29 by the Jews themselves,
00:01:31 when they were counseled and given direction
00:01:34 from Ezra and from Nehemiah,
00:01:36 to send those wives away along with the children.
00:01:41 And that’s an interesting thing.
00:01:42 It must have been a bit difficult
00:01:45 for some husbands to see their children sent away.
00:01:47 But all they knew were the languages of the pagan wives
00:01:51 —nothing about Hebrew and the worship of Jehovah God.
00:01:55 And the problem was that they were sent away to keep the Jews
00:01:58 from losing their identity by a gradual assimilation into the cultures
00:02:02 and the religions of the surrounding nations that those wives belonged to.
00:02:09 In Nehemiah’s day, speaking Hebrew was vital,
00:02:13 and we’re grateful it’s not necessary today.
00:02:16 We all don’t have to learn Hebrew.
00:02:18 But in his wisdom, Jehovah invites people who speak any language
00:02:22 to learn the “pure language,” the truth about him and his purposes.
00:02:27 And, you know, it’s a bit like the opposite
00:02:30 of what took place at the Tower of Babel,
00:02:33 where Jehovah intervened and confused the builders of the Tower of Babel,
00:02:37 imposing upon them different languages, including different ways of thinking.
00:02:42 And so they went off disorganized and separated from one another.
00:02:46 And today, we have people from all over the world
00:02:49 who speak many, many different languages,
00:02:51 but in Jehovah’s wisdom,
00:02:53 he’s bringing them all together
00:02:55 —those who love the truth and love him— in unity.
00:02:59 And this is what Zephaniah says —Zephaniah 3:9.
00:03:03 It speaks of the “pure language”:
00:03:06 “I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language,
00:03:11 in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah.”
00:03:14 And that’s what these people do who speak other languages.
00:03:16 We reach them with the truth, but then they’re unified
00:03:19 with Jehovah’s organization,
00:03:21 because it goes on to say “in order to serve him
00:03:24 shoulder to shoulder.”
00:03:27 So isn’t that interesting—the way Jehovah has used the “pure language”
00:03:31 to bring people of many diverse backgrounds
00:03:34 and languages together in his worship?
00:03:38 In our day, people of many different languages
00:03:40 are leaving their home countries to live elsewhere.
00:03:43 And it’s really quite amazing when you consider:
00:03:46 Large cities are filled with people
00:03:48 of different languages, and even in little villages,
00:03:51 we find people speaking different languages.
00:03:55 They need help to learn the truth
00:03:58 in the language of their heart.
00:04:03 It’s interesting to note how many Bethelites
00:04:06 have learned other languages in order to teach the truth to people.
00:04:10 In the United States Bethel, in our branch,
00:04:14 there are over 2,500 Bethelites
00:04:18 who are engaged
00:04:21 in 24 different language groups and congregations.
00:04:25 So a lot of Bethelites (and commuters are included in those numbers)
00:04:29 are doing a very fine work
00:04:31 in helping people in the territory to learn the truth.
00:04:35 And wouldn’t it be nice— I know some of us would love to learn some other languages
00:04:39 —wouldn’t it be lovely if we could learn the way a child does?
00:04:41 They just absorb it —no effort—
00:04:44 and they start speaking it.
00:04:46 A researcher, Dr. John Brierley, says this:
00:04:49 “‘Clearly the young brain seems
00:04:52 “to be programmed almost like a computer’
00:04:54 “for language development.
00:04:56 “He notes that even ‘brain anatomy’ suggests
00:04:59 “‘that an infant is born
00:05:01 with a pre-programmed biological capacity to speak.’”
00:05:06 And then the comment in Awake!  said
00:05:09 that it’s as though the brain is hardwired
00:05:12 to learn language.
00:05:14 I’m sorry to say that as the years go by,
00:05:17 the hardwiring starts to fray a bit in many of us.
00:05:24 But if we make the effort
00:05:27 and we do make a switch to a congregation where they speak the language
00:05:32 that you would like to learn, remember this:
00:05:35 Children can be a big help in the congregation
00:05:37 that you attend in a foreign language.
00:05:40 They can also be very startling and frank:
00:05:43 “You speak funny.
00:05:45 “Why can’t you pronounce that word properly?
00:05:48 It’s so easy.”
00:05:49 ‘Well, yes, to you  it’s easy.
00:05:51 You were raised with it.’
00:05:53 But that’s how kids are.
00:05:54 They don’t realize the difficulties we have
00:05:57 as we get older,  with the grooves being so deep
00:05:59 and so thick in the brain with our original language
00:06:02 that it’s hard to get out of those grooves the vowels and consonants
00:06:06 that we’re not used  to saying in a certain order.
00:06:11 Keep a sense of humor; listen to the kids.
00:06:14 They’ll help you.
00:06:15 And don’t be overly concerned
00:06:18 about speaking a new language without an accent.
00:06:22 Everybody has an accent one way or another.
00:06:25 Some are more agreeable than others, but everyone has that.
00:06:29 And some don’t want to admit it, but they really do.
00:06:32 They have an accent.
00:06:33 Even when we all speak the same language, you can tell where a person is from
00:06:37 —whether it’s east, north, west (whatever it may be), south.
00:06:40 There are accents or intonations in the way words are pronounced.
00:06:45 I remember, in years gone by, for missionaries
00:06:47 who were sent out into the field,
00:06:49 we had to follow a special program in learning a new language.
00:06:53 Your first month in your new assignment,
00:06:55 you had to study 11 hours a day
00:06:57 for 30 days your new language.
00:07:00 Well, you felt like you were in the Tower of Babel
00:07:03 on those occasions because it was very difficult.
00:07:06 The second month, you had to study your new language
00:07:08 four hours a day and be out preaching 130 hours.
00:07:12 Your third month was 150 hours in the field ministry,
00:07:15 and you’d study the language as you could.
00:07:19 For those who are striving to learn a new language,
00:07:21 here are a few suggestions I gleaned from the Awake!  of March 2007
00:07:26 and the January issue of 2000.
00:07:29 There are four points:
00:07:31 (1) motivation,
00:07:33 (2) humility,
00:07:35 (3) patience,
00:07:37 (4) practice.
00:07:39 “Motivation.
00:07:41 You need an incentive —a reason to pursue your goal.”
00:07:45 Because if you have a high level of motivation,
00:07:47 you’re going to be more successful.
00:07:49 Well, we have the best motivation there is:
00:07:52 teach people the truth; praise our God, Jehovah;
00:07:55 build up the congregation we’ve chosen to attend.
00:07:58 What about humility?
00:08:01 Well, “don’t expect too much of yourself” when you start learning a new language.
00:08:06 “Mistakes are inevitable.”
00:08:08 And if you wait until you can speak it perfectly
00:08:11 before you start making comments or give a talk,
00:08:14 you may be waiting quite a while.
00:08:16 Be prepared, because it may not be
00:08:19 until after Armageddon that you achieve that goal.
00:08:22 So don’t be afraid to make mistakes and carry on with your new language.
00:08:27 ‘Patience.
00:08:29 ‘A brother stated: “For me, the first two years were difficult,
00:08:32 ‘and at times I felt like giving up.”
00:08:35 ‘Still, he acknowledges
00:08:37 that it does get easier as time goes by.’
00:08:40 And it gets enjoyable.
00:08:42 And number four: “Practice.
00:08:45 “A regular routine will help you to become fluent in [your] new language.
00:08:49 “Try to practice every day, even if it’s for just a few minutes.
00:08:53 “[There’s an interesting saying] As one textbook puts it,
00:08:56 “‘“A little and often”
00:08:58 is preferable to “a lot but seldom.”’”
00:09:02 So be steady,
00:09:04 even for short periods of time, in practicing the new language.
00:09:08 Now, the fact is that most Bethelites in our branch
00:09:11 are serving in the English-language field,
00:09:13 and they are truly a blessing to their congregations.
00:09:17 The brothers are happy to have Bethelites who take the lead,
00:09:21 who give of themselves, and who work hard to build up the congregation.
00:09:26 So the decision to serve in an English congregation
00:09:29 or with a different language group is highly personal.
00:09:33 Whatever the decision may be, there’s a key factor
00:09:37 that we all have to keep in mind
00:09:39 to maintain our spirituality at a high level
00:09:42 and give our Bethel assignment our best.
00:09:46 And that key factor that we have to keep in mind
00:09:49 is to focus on the one language that counts the most
00:09:53 —the “pure language” that Jehovah God has given to his people.

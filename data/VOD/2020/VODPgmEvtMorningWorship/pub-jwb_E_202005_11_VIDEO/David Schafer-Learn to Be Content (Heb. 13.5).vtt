Let’s go back to our Bibles

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:06.056 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Hebrews 13:5, 6

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:09.092 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and see the context of today’s text.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.828 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Here, in Hebrews chapter 13, it says:

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:15.598 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Let your way of life be free

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.768 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“of the love of money, while you are content

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the present things.

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:25.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For he has said: ‘I will never leave you,

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will never abandon you.’

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So that we may be of good courage and say:

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can man do to me?’”

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are certainly encouraging words

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:46.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in days of economic uncertainty.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think about thousands of people

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are left homeless as a result of flooding

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:56.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such lands as the United States
(in Texas and Louisiana),

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in Sierra Leone
(with massive landslides),

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers in Colombia.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we think about millions

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are still gripped by severe poverty

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people acting in desperation in Venezuela.

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:14.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is
a very key promise for Jehovah’s people.

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a closer look at it

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:19.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how it’s helping our brothers.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was it issued?

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was it needed?

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:22.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who wrote these words?

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, evidence points to the apostle Paul.

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from where did he write, and when?

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:33.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, look at chapter 13, verses 23 and 24:

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:36.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want you to know that our brother Timothy

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has been released
[“released”—so Paul was in prison].

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he comes soon,
I will be with him when I see you.”

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul was thinking
he was at the end of his own prison term.

00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then verse 24, the latter part:

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:57.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those in Italy send you their greetings.”

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for these and other reasons,
we conclude that Paul wrote Hebrews

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 61 C.E. right before he was released

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his first imprisonment in Rome.

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many times had Paul
been in jail up to this point?

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:13.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you recall that he had been in jail

00:02:13.183 --> 00:02:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Silas in Philippi back around 50 C.E.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would’ve been
during his second missionary journey.

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, around 56 C. E.,
he spent two years in prison in Caesarea,

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he went on
to have his case heard in Rome.

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:30.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that took a boat; he was shipwrecked;

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:32.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he went to Malta,
eventually got on another boat,

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:34.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wound up in Rome, where he spent

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another two years under house arrest,

00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which ended in 61 C.E.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he would have been thrown in jail
one more time before he was martyred.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why mention all of that?

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Paul could talk
from experience about contentment.

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew what it meant
to follow Jehovah’s direction,

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it meant
being “low on provisions” at times.

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:56.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew prison food.

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew Philippi prison food;

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knew Caesarea prison food;
he knew Rome prison food.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:05.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote to the Philippians also

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was under house arrest.

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to the Philippians, he wrote the words

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we find in chapter 4, verses 11 and 12:

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have learned [how] to be self-sufficient

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“regardless of my circumstances.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know how to be low on provisions

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and how to have an abundance.

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In everything and in all circumstances

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have learned the secret of both

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how to be full and how to hunger,

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:39.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both how to have an abundance
and how to do without.”

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:43.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there is a secret, and Paul knew it.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly contentment is a twofold secret.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:49.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we experience financial prosperity,

00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:52.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need wisdom to know how to view that.

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some conclude, ‘Well, you know,
if I can afford it, why not buy it?’

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:02.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to those who know the secret,
the question is not always,

00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I living within my means?

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:09.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather, Is Jehovah part of my plans?

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul knew not only

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how to have an abundance”
but also “how to do without,”

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to be content with less.

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:18.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that means knowing

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to keep natural anxiety in perspective.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:26.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A content person will never overreact

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:28.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of financial loss.

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:29.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So back to the Hebrews.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did the Hebrews need this counsel?

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think of the timing—61 C.E.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What had occurred 20,

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
15 years prior to this

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:46.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—41-54 C.E.?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “great famine”
—the “great famine” mentioned

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:52.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Acts 11:28, 29—

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a famine so severe that Christians

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from other parts of the world
were sending relief supplies

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:02.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in Judea,
a famine that lasted for years.

00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Had memories of this famine

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made the brothers there in Judea,

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones to whom Paul
wrote the letter to the Hebrews,

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerned about money?

00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:15.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might there be a lesson in that for us?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:20.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no matter how poor we may be,
we should never come to love money

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:23.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or become so preoccupied with money.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:27.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we should concentrate
on being rich toward Jehovah.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we have any recent examples of that

00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:33.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—examples of those who are showing
how they’re “content with the present things”

00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they know
“the secret of . . . how to do without”

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—of people who are
putting spiritual interests first?

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider the situation
of our brothers in Venezuela.

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The International Monetary Fund projects

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that inflation
will soon exceed 2,000 percent

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Venezuela.

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that something
that you once paid $3.00 for,

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will soon pay $63.00 for.

00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Security, of course,
is a major concern for our brothers.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are acting in desperation.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Armed gangs will ransack any building

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they think
has something of value inside.

00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An unexpected situation arose

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:14.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the theme
of this year’s convention,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t Give Up!,”
which in Spanish is <i>“¡No se rinda!”</i>

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>“¡No se rinda!”</i>
is the theme that has been adopted

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:24.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the opposition
political party, coincidentally.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the convention location
in one of the cities had actually—

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They canceled our contract
when the administrator saw

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he presumed to be

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the opposition party’s campaign slogan.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:42.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was only when a sister,

00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gives private schooling
to the state governor’s children,

00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:50.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explained our neutral stand to his wife

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the misunderstanding was clarified

00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the convention went ahead as planned

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—clear thinking in a time of panic

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in a time of economic uncertainty
putting spiritual things first.

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of our brothers benefited spiritually
from her clear thinking.

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Circuit overseers
report on the generous spirit

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:14.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the congregations
as the friends share what little they have.

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:18.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of all the chaos, the brothers
are showing admirable resilience.

00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:21.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the branch writes:
“Spiritually, [this is a quote]

00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have never been so prosperous.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meeting attendance, field service activity,

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the number
of regular pioneers are on the increase.

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“People who have shown little interest
in the past have asked to study the Bible.

“We hear many sincere

—“content with the present things.”

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why did Paul’s advice in his letter

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Hebrews prove to be timely?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the timing—61 C.E.

00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:02.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened in 66 C.E.?

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:06.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Roman army
of Cestius Gallus surrounded Jerusalem.

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:09.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told his disciples what to watch for

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what to do when it finally happened.

00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now their survival depended

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not on the stability of their employment,

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor on the value
of their material possessions,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on their obedience.

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having kept their spirituality strong,

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having maintained
a rich condition toward Jehovah,

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the obedient ones knew exactly what to do.

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know
what the future will hold for us.

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk 3:17 says

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘the fields may not produce food’

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more of us before the end comes.

00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can continue
to see how Jehovah fulfills his promise:

00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:54.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will never leave you,
. . . I will never abandon you.”

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we understand that,
then we can truly be

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“content with the present things.”

00:00:01 Let’s go back to our Bibles
00:00:03 to Hebrews 13:5, 6
00:00:06 and see the context of today’s text.
00:00:09 Here, in Hebrews chapter 13, it says:
00:00:11 “Let your way of life be free
00:00:15 “of the love of money, while you are content
00:00:18 “with the present things.
00:00:20 “For he has said: ‘I will never leave you,
00:00:25 “and I will never abandon you.’
00:00:30 “So that we may be of good courage and say:
00:00:32 “‘Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.
00:00:36 What can man do to me?’”
00:00:39 Well, those are certainly encouraging words
00:00:42 in days of economic uncertainty.
00:00:46 We think about thousands of people
00:00:49 who are left homeless as a result of flooding
00:00:52 in such lands as the United States (in Texas and Louisiana),
00:00:56 but also in Sierra Leone (with massive landslides),
00:01:00 and our brothers in Colombia.
00:01:03 And we think about millions
00:01:05 who are still gripped by severe poverty
00:01:08 —people acting in desperation in Venezuela.
00:01:11 So this is a very key promise for Jehovah’s people.
00:01:14 Let’s take a closer look at it
00:01:16 and how it’s helping our brothers.
00:01:19 When was it issued?
00:01:20 Why was it needed?
00:01:21 Who wrote these words?
00:01:22 Well, evidence points to the apostle Paul.
00:01:25 And from where did he write, and when?
00:01:28 Here, look at chapter 13, verses 23 and 24:
00:01:33 “I want you to know that our brother Timothy
00:01:36 “has been released [“released”—so Paul was in prison].
00:01:42 If he comes soon, I will be with him when I see you.”
00:01:46 So Paul was thinking he was at the end of his own prison term.
00:01:51 And then verse 24, the latter part:
00:01:54 “Those in Italy send you their greetings.”
00:01:57 So for these and other reasons, we conclude that Paul wrote Hebrews
00:02:01 in 61 C.E. right before he was released
00:02:05 from his first imprisonment in Rome.
00:02:08 How many times had Paul been in jail up to this point?
00:02:11 Well, you recall that he had been in jail
00:02:13 with Silas in Philippi back around 50 C.E.
00:02:17 That would’ve been during his second missionary journey.
00:02:19 Then, around 56 C. E., he spent two years in prison in Caesarea,
00:02:23 and then he went on to have his case heard in Rome.
00:02:27 And that took a boat; he was shipwrecked;
00:02:30 he went to Malta, eventually got on another boat,
00:02:32 and wound up in Rome, where he spent
00:02:34 another two years under house arrest,
00:02:38 which ended in 61 C.E.
00:02:41 And he would have been thrown in jail one more time before he was martyred.
00:02:44 Well, why mention all of that?
00:02:45 Because Paul could talk from experience about contentment.
00:02:49 He knew what it meant to follow Jehovah’s direction,
00:02:51 even if it meant being “low on provisions” at times.
00:02:54 He knew prison food.
00:02:56 He knew Philippi prison food;
00:02:58 he knew Caesarea prison food; he knew Rome prison food.
00:03:02 Paul wrote to the Philippians also
00:03:05 when he was under house arrest.
00:03:07 And to the Philippians, he wrote the words
00:03:09 that we find in chapter 4, verses 11 and 12:
00:03:13 “I have learned [how] to be self-sufficient
00:03:17 “regardless of my circumstances.
00:03:19 “I know how to be low on provisions
00:03:22 “and how to have an abundance.
00:03:26 “In everything and in all circumstances
00:03:28 “I have learned the secret of both
00:03:31 “how to be full and how to hunger,
00:03:34 both how to have an abundance and how to do without.”
00:03:39 Well, there is a secret, and Paul knew it.
00:03:43 Godly contentment is a twofold secret.
00:03:46 If we experience financial prosperity,
00:03:49 we need wisdom to know how to view that.
00:03:52 Some conclude, ‘Well, you know, if I can afford it, why not buy it?’
00:03:58 But to those who know the secret, the question is not always,
00:04:02 Am I living within my means?
00:04:05 but rather, Is Jehovah part of my plans?
00:04:09 Paul knew not only
00:04:12 “how to have an abundance” but also “how to do without,”
00:04:14 how to be content with less.
00:04:16 And that means knowing
00:04:18 how to keep natural anxiety in perspective.
00:04:23 A content person will never overreact
00:04:26 as a result of financial loss.
00:04:28 So back to the Hebrews.
00:04:29 Why did the Hebrews need this counsel?
00:04:33 Well, think of the timing—61 C.E.
00:04:37 What had occurred 20,
00:04:40 15 years prior to this
00:04:43 —41-54 C.E.?
00:04:46 The “great famine” —the “great famine” mentioned
00:04:48 at Acts 11:28, 29—
00:04:52 a famine so severe that Christians
00:04:55 from other parts of the world were sending relief supplies
00:04:58 to our brothers in Judea, a famine that lasted for years.
00:05:02 Had memories of this famine
00:05:05 made the brothers there in Judea,
00:05:07 the ones to whom Paul wrote the letter to the Hebrews,
00:05:10 concerned about money?
00:05:13 Might there be a lesson in that for us?
00:05:15 Well, no matter how poor we may be, we should never come to love money
00:05:20 or become so preoccupied with money.
00:05:23 Instead, we should concentrate on being rich toward Jehovah.
00:05:27 Do we have any recent examples of that
00:05:28 —examples of those who are showing how they’re “content with the present things”
00:05:33 and that they know “the secret of . . . how to do without”
00:05:36 —of people who are putting spiritual interests first?
00:05:40 Well, consider the situation of our brothers in Venezuela.
00:05:43 The International Monetary Fund projects
00:05:46 that inflation will soon exceed 2,000 percent
00:05:49 in Venezuela.
00:05:51 That means that something that you once paid $3.00 for,
00:05:55 you will soon pay $63.00 for.
00:05:58 Security, of course, is a major concern for our brothers.
00:06:02 People are acting in desperation.
00:06:04 Armed gangs will ransack any building
00:06:06 that they think has something of value inside.
00:06:10 An unexpected situation arose
00:06:12 because of the theme of this year’s convention,
00:06:14 “Don’t Give Up!,” which in Spanish is “¡No se rinda!”
00:06:17 And “¡No se rinda!” is the theme that has been adopted
00:06:20 by the opposition political party, coincidentally.
00:06:24 So the convention location in one of the cities had actually—
00:06:29 They canceled our contract when the administrator saw
00:06:33 what he presumed to be
00:06:35 the opposition party’s campaign slogan.
00:06:39 Well, it was only when a sister,
00:06:42 who gives private schooling to the state governor’s children,
00:06:46 explained our neutral stand to his wife
00:06:50 that the misunderstanding was clarified
00:06:52 and the convention went ahead as planned
00:06:55 —clear thinking in a time of panic
00:06:59 and in a time of economic uncertainty putting spiritual things first.
00:07:03 And all of our brothers benefited spiritually from her clear thinking.
00:07:07 Circuit overseers report on the generous spirit
00:07:10 of the congregations as the friends share what little they have.
00:07:14 In spite of all the chaos, the brothers are showing admirable resilience.
00:07:18 And the branch writes: “Spiritually, [this is a quote]
00:07:21 “we have never been so prosperous.
00:07:24 “Meeting attendance, field service activity,
00:07:26 “and the number of regular pioneers are on the increase.
00:07:30 “People who have shown little interest in the past have asked to study the Bible.
00:07:33 “New faces are seen at meetings, assemblies, and conventions.
00:07:36 “We hear many sincere expressions of appreciation
00:07:39 “for all the provisions to strengthen our faith.
00:07:42 The brothers are so happy to be in the truth”
00:07:45 —“content with the present things.”
00:07:49 Well, why did Paul’s advice in his letter
00:07:52 to the Hebrews prove to be timely?
00:07:54 Think of the timing—61 C.E.
00:07:59 What happened in 66 C.E.?
00:08:02 The Roman army of Cestius Gallus surrounded Jerusalem.
00:08:06 Jesus told his disciples what to watch for
00:08:09 and what to do when it finally happened.
00:08:11 Now their survival depended
00:08:14 not on the stability of their employment,
00:08:16 nor on the value of their material possessions,
00:08:21 but on their obedience.
00:08:23 Having kept their spirituality strong,
00:08:26 having maintained a rich condition toward Jehovah,
00:08:31 the obedient ones knew exactly what to do.
00:08:35 Well, we don’t know what the future will hold for us.
00:08:38 Habakkuk 3:17 says
00:08:41 that ‘the fields may not produce food’
00:08:43 for more of us before the end comes.
00:08:46 But we can continue to see how Jehovah fulfills his promise:
00:08:50 “I will never leave you, . . . I will never abandon you.”
00:08:54 And when we understand that, then we can truly be
00:08:56 “content with the present things.”

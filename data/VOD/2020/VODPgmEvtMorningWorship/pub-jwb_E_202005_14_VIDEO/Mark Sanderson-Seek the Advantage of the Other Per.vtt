Well, brothers, let’s open our Bibles,

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.123 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read again our text for today

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:11.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 10:23.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All things are lawful,

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not all things are advantageous.”

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you notice it goes on to say:

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:27.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,
but not all things build up.

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:31.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep seeking,
not his own advantage,

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:39.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is Paul trying to tell us here?

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 1975 <i>Watchtower,</i>
commenting on these two verses,

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:46.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is what <i>The Watchtower</i>  said: 

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Within the framework of Christian law

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there is a wide latitude of action

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Christian has to decide many matters

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to his Christian conscience.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he must consider also
the consciences of others.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not all things build up

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:08.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either himself or others.”

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what’s the point?

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:13.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many, many areas of life

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there is not a specific law

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that governs our action as Christians.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to use Bible principles

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:27.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the wonderful gift of the conscience
that Jehovah God has given us.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most often, we tend to think
of the conscience

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as something that prevents us

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from doing what is wrong.

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, maybe we tend to think of it
as being like the smoke alarm.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When there’s just
that slightest hint of smoke,

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:47.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that alarm goes off to protect us,

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to signal that something is wrong

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something needs to be done.

00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:57.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s true that our
well-trained conscience can alert us

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re about to enter
into a course that could cause us danger.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if our conscience is really well-trained

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the thinking
of our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:13.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be able to do even more than that.

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we have in mind?

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider an example of King David

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:21.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he had to flee from Jerusalem

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the time of the revolt of Absalom.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go to 2 Samuel chapter 17.

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:30.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you’re looking this up,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Samuel chapter 17,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll remember that down here in verse 27,

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three faithful men came to know

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that David and some of his men
were out there in the wilderness.

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what did they do?
Look at verse 27:

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:51.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As soon as David came to Mahanaim,

00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:56.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shobi the son of Nahash
from Rabbah of the Ammonites,

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Machir the son of Ammiel from Lodebar,

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brought beds, basins, clay pots,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain,

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:13.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“broad beans, lentils, parched grain,

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“honey, butter, sheep, and cheese.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They brought all of this out for David
and the people with him to eat,

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for they said [now, notice this]:

00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The people are hungry and tired

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thirsty in the wilderness.’”

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, these men came to know

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about David and his men being out there
in the wilderness with no supplies.

00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did that affect them?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, their conscience began to work,

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:51.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it showed them they needed
to do something to help those men.

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you look at that list of things,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s obvious they didn’t just send
one or two things,

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their conscience moved them
to really do something kind,

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do something generous,
to do something good to help them.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, consider also
that helping David was risky.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:12.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absalom was more than willing to kill people

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were going to support David.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it took a risk of even their own safety.

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these men,
because of their good conscience,

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:27.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were moved to do the right thing,
the good thing, the generous thing.

00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:29.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we learn from that?

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a well-trained conscience

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:35.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not just simply prevent us
from doing the wrong thing,

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:40.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it has the power to move us
to do what’s right,

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what’s kind, what’s generous,
what’s loyal

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:47.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers and to Jehovah.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, Jesus also taught this lesson.

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s look at the example
that Jesus taught in this parable.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, we always used to call it
the parable of the good Samaritan,

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:01.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now we call it the parable
of the neighborly Samaritan.

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:03.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m still getting used to that myself.

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:06.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Luke chapter 10—

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s just remind ourselves
of some of the details about this.

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you remember, first of all, in verse 30:

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[This] man was going . . .
from Jerusalem to Jericho

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:22.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [he] fell victim to robbers.”

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 30 says that they ‘beat him,

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they left him half-dead’ on the road.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now look at verse 31.

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says here that a priest
was going by on the road

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:41.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he saw this man
laying on the road half-dead.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he do?

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says he crossed the street.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went to the other side and passed by

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as though that man was not even there.

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now look at verse 32.

00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here comes a Levite, and he sees him also.

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does he do?

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:03.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just exactly the same thing.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He crosses the road and passes by

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid having to even look
at this man who was in distress.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you say about those two men?

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their conscience was
not working at all, was it?

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:21.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now what about the Samaritan?

00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 33 says that when he saw this man,

00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:27.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was moved with pity.”

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he do?

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 34 says: ‘He approached him,

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:35.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘he bandaged his wounds,
he poured oil and wine on them,

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘he put the man on his own animal,

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:40.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘he brought him to an inn,
he took care of him,

00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘he took out money,
and he gave it to the innkeeper.

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He said: “Take care of him;

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“whatever you spend besides this,
I’ll come back and I’ll give it to you.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll pay you.”’

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we know about this man
who was a Samaritan?

00:06:55.865 --> 00:07:00.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, his conscience was working,

00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it told him what was
the right thing to do

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what was the good thing,
the generous thing,

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the helpful thing to do—
for this man.

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This good conscience

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:17.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if it’s well-trained by Bible principles

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:20.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by the thinking of our God, Jehovah—

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:23.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will do so much more

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than just prevent us
from entering into a wrong course.

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will stimulate us to do the right thing,

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:33.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the generous thing, the kind thing.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we use this information

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the midst today
of this coronavirus pandemic?

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, no doubt all of us right now

00:07:43.146 --> 00:07:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are feeling some measure
of anxiety and stress

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:49.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as this goes on week after week,

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having to be in our room,
sheltering in place, and so on.

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:56.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not an easy situation for any of us.

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one country in Europe
that has been very hard hit

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the pandemic,

00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister was in the hospital
for cancer treatment

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:06.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the lockdown was enforced.

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:09.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, her daughter
and son-in-law are at Bethel.

00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:12.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re very, very close to the hospital,

00:08:12.008 --> 00:08:15.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were not able to go
and visit her because of the situation.

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:18.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as the Memorial was approaching,

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this dear sister was so worried

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she was going to have
to celebrate the Memorial

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all by herself in the hospital.

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:29.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine how touched she was

00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:33.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she found out that a sister
who worked in the hospital

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had very kindly decided
to travel to the hospital

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it was not her shift

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just for the sole purpose

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being with our sister
and celebrating the Memorial?

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:48.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She dressed up
in all the appropriate protective gear

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then enjoyed the Memorial

00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:52.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our sister who was alone
at the hospital.

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How beautiful!

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same country in Europe,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers told about a young brother
who works also in a hospital

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:05.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, because the country
has been so hard hit

00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:08.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of our brothers
and sisters have died

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:10.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of the pandemic,

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:14.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this dear brother has made a point
of going to visit

00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:17.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these various brothers and sisters
who are dying

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to offer them comfort

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because their own family members
are not able to come to the hospital

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:26.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be with them at that time.

00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:29.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how comforting it’s been

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:32.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those family members to know

00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this young brother has taken
the initiative to be with them,

00:09:35.858 --> 00:09:40.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to comfort them, to show them love
in such a difficult time?

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers, what do we learn
from all of this?

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are in a time of increased stress,

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:49.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of increased anxiety.

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:53.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have the power to help others

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:57.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through acts of kindness
and deeds of goodness

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that show generosity and love.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be motivated by our good conscience

00:10:04.987 --> 00:10:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do those good and kind
and generous things

00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really show that we’re imitators
of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:15.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, we’re going to find

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our stress will be relieved,

00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the same time, we’ll show
that we’re eager to do things

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not only lawful

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also that are advantageous.

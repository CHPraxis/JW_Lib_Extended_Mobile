00:00:02 Well, brothers, let’s open our Bibles,
00:00:04 and let’s read again our text for today
00:00:07 —1 Corinthians 10:23.
00:00:12 It says: “All things are lawful,
00:00:15 but not all things are advantageous.”
00:00:19 And then you notice it goes on to say:
00:00:22 “All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
00:00:27 “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage,
00:00:31 but that of the other person.”
00:00:34 Now, what is Paul trying to tell us here?
00:00:39 In the 1975 Watchtower, commenting on these two verses,
00:00:44 this is what The Watchtower  said:
00:00:46 “Within the framework of Christian law
00:00:49 “there is a wide latitude of action
00:00:52 “and the Christian has to decide many matters
00:00:56 “according to his Christian conscience.
00:00:59 “But he must consider also the consciences of others.
00:01:03 “Not all things build up
00:01:05 either himself or others.”
00:01:08 Well, now, what’s the point?
00:01:11 There are many, many areas of life
00:01:13 where there is not a specific law
00:01:17 that governs our action as Christians.
00:01:20 We have to use Bible principles
00:01:22 and the wonderful gift of the conscience that Jehovah God has given us.
00:01:27 But most often, we tend to think of the conscience
00:01:31 as something that prevents us
00:01:34 from doing what is wrong.
00:01:37 In fact, maybe we tend to think of it as being like the smoke alarm.
00:01:41 When there’s just that slightest hint of smoke,
00:01:44 that alarm goes off to protect us,
00:01:47 to signal that something is wrong
00:01:50 —something needs to be done.
00:01:52 Well, it’s true that our well-trained conscience can alert us
00:01:57 when we’re about to enter into a course that could cause us danger.
00:02:01 But if our conscience is really well-trained
00:02:06 according to the thinking of our heavenly Father, Jehovah,
00:02:09 it will be able to do even more than that.
00:02:13 Now, what do we have in mind?
00:02:15 Well, let’s consider an example of King David
00:02:18 when he had to flee from Jerusalem
00:02:21 at the time of the revolt of Absalom.
00:02:24 Now, let’s go to 2 Samuel chapter 17.
00:02:28 Now, as you’re looking this up,
00:02:30 2 Samuel chapter 17,
00:02:34 you’ll remember that down here in verse 27,
00:02:38 three faithful men came to know
00:02:41 that David and some of his men were out there in the wilderness.
00:02:44 Now, what did they do? Look at verse 27:
00:02:48 “As soon as David came to Mahanaim,
00:02:51 “Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites,
00:02:56 “Machir the son of Ammiel from Lodebar,
00:02:59 “and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
00:03:03 “brought beds, basins, clay pots,
00:03:07 “wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain,
00:03:10 “broad beans, lentils, parched grain,
00:03:13 “honey, butter, sheep, and cheese.
00:03:17 “They brought all of this out for David and the people with him to eat,
00:03:21 “for they said [now, notice this]:
00:03:24 “‘The people are hungry and tired
00:03:28 and thirsty in the wilderness.’”
00:03:32 Now, what’s the point?
00:03:34 You see, these men came to know
00:03:37 about David and his men being out there in the wilderness with no supplies.
00:03:41 Now, how did that affect them?
00:03:44 Well, their conscience began to work,
00:03:47 and it showed them they needed to do something to help those men.
00:03:51 Now, when you look at that list of things,
00:03:54 it’s obvious they didn’t just send one or two things,
00:03:57 but their conscience moved them to really do something kind,
00:04:02 to do something generous, to do something good to help them.
00:04:07 Now, consider also that helping David was risky.
00:04:10 Absalom was more than willing to kill people
00:04:12 who were going to support David.
00:04:15 So it took a risk of even their own safety.
00:04:19 But these men, because of their good conscience,
00:04:22 were moved to do the right thing, the good thing, the generous thing.
00:04:27 Now, what do we learn from that?
00:04:29 Well, a well-trained conscience
00:04:31 will not just simply prevent us from doing the wrong thing,
00:04:35 but it has the power to move us to do what’s right,
00:04:40 to do what’s kind, what’s generous, what’s loyal
00:04:43 to our brothers and to Jehovah.
00:04:47 Well, now, Jesus also taught this lesson.
00:04:50 And let’s look at the example that Jesus taught in this parable.
00:04:55 Now, of course, we always used to call it the parable of the good Samaritan,
00:04:58 but now we call it the parable of the neighborly Samaritan.
00:05:01 I’m still getting used to that myself.
00:05:03 But Luke chapter 10—
00:05:07 And let’s just remind ourselves of some of the details about this.
00:05:12 So you remember, first of all, in verse 30:
00:05:16 “[This] man was going . . . from Jerusalem to Jericho
00:05:19 and [he] fell victim to robbers.”
00:05:22 And verse 30 says that they ‘beat him,
00:05:25 and they left him half-dead’ on the road.
00:05:28 Now look at verse 31.
00:05:32 It says here that a priest was going by on the road
00:05:36 and that he saw this man laying on the road half-dead.
00:05:41 And what did he do?
00:05:43 It says he crossed the street.
00:05:46 He went to the other side and passed by
00:05:50 as though that man was not even there.
00:05:54 But now look at verse 32.
00:05:57 Here comes a Levite, and he sees him also.
00:06:00 But what does he do?
00:06:01 Just exactly the same thing.
00:06:03 He crosses the road and passes by
00:06:07 to avoid having to even look at this man who was in distress.
00:06:12 What can you say about those two men?
00:06:14 Their conscience was not working at all, was it?
00:06:18 But now what about the Samaritan?
00:06:21 Verse 33 says that when he saw this man,
00:06:25 “he was moved with pity.”
00:06:27 And what did he do?
00:06:28 Verse 34 says: ‘He approached him,
00:06:31 ‘he bandaged his wounds, he poured oil and wine on them,
00:06:35 ‘he put the man on his own animal,
00:06:37 ‘he brought him to an inn, he took care of him,
00:06:40 ‘he took out money, and he gave it to the innkeeper.
00:06:43 ‘He said: “Take care of him;
00:06:45 ‘“whatever you spend besides this, I’ll come back and I’ll give it to you.
00:06:48 I’ll pay you.”’
00:06:51 Now, what do we know about this man who was a Samaritan?
00:06:55 Obviously, his conscience was working,
00:07:00 and it told him what was the right thing to do
00:07:03 —what was the good thing, the generous thing,
00:07:06 the helpful thing to do— for this man.
00:07:10 Well, what’s the point?
00:07:12 This good conscience
00:07:14 —if it’s well-trained by Bible principles
00:07:17 and by the thinking of our God, Jehovah—
00:07:20 will do so much more
00:07:23 than just prevent us from entering into a wrong course.
00:07:26 It will stimulate us to do the right thing,
00:07:30 the generous thing, the kind thing.
00:07:33 Now, how can we use this information
00:07:36 in the midst today of this coronavirus pandemic?
00:07:39 Well, of course, no doubt all of us right now
00:07:43 are feeling some measure of anxiety and stress
00:07:47 as this goes on week after week,
00:07:49 having to be in our room, sheltering in place, and so on.
00:07:52 It’s not an easy situation for any of us.
00:07:56 In one country in Europe that has been very hard hit
00:07:58 by the pandemic,
00:08:01 a sister was in the hospital for cancer treatment
00:08:04 when the lockdown was enforced.
00:08:06 Now, her daughter and son-in-law are at Bethel.
00:08:09 They’re very, very close to the hospital,
00:08:12 but they were not able to go and visit her because of the situation.
00:08:15 Now, as the Memorial was approaching,
00:08:18 this dear sister was so worried
00:08:21 that she was going to have to celebrate the Memorial
00:08:23 all by herself in the hospital.
00:08:26 But can you imagine how touched she was
00:08:29 when she found out that a sister who worked in the hospital
00:08:33 had very kindly decided to travel to the hospital
00:08:37 when it was not her shift
00:08:39 just for the sole purpose
00:08:41 of being with our sister and celebrating the Memorial?
00:08:44 She dressed up in all the appropriate protective gear
00:08:48 and then enjoyed the Memorial
00:08:50 with our sister who was alone at the hospital.
00:08:52 How beautiful!
00:08:54 In the same country in Europe,
00:08:57 the brothers told about a young brother who works also in a hospital
00:09:02 and, of course, because the country has been so hard hit
00:09:05 and some of our brothers and sisters have died
00:09:08 as a result of the pandemic,
00:09:10 this dear brother has made a point of going to visit
00:09:14 these various brothers and sisters who are dying
00:09:17 to offer them comfort
00:09:19 because their own family members are not able to come to the hospital
00:09:24 and be with them at that time.
00:09:26 Can you imagine how comforting it’s been
00:09:29 for those family members to know
00:09:32 that this young brother has taken the initiative to be with them,
00:09:35 to comfort them, to show them love in such a difficult time?
00:09:40 Well, brothers, what do we learn from all of this?
00:09:43 We are in a time of increased stress,
00:09:47 of increased anxiety.
00:09:49 We all have the power to help others
00:09:53 through acts of kindness and deeds of goodness
00:09:57 that show generosity and love.
00:10:00 Let’s be motivated by our good conscience
00:10:04 to do those good and kind and generous things
00:10:08 that really show that we’re imitators of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:10:13 And as we do, we’re going to find
00:10:15 that our stress will be relieved,
00:10:19 and at the same time, we’ll show that we’re eager to do things
00:10:23 that are not only lawful
00:10:25 but also that are advantageous.

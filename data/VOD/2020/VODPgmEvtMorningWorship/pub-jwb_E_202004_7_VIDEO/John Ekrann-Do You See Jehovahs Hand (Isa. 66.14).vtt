00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, I think all of us would agree

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when things are going well

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—when we get a court victory,

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when someone’s health improves,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:15.432 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or maybe when someone really asked

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to study the Bible with us
and they’re at our meetings.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:23.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s harder to see Jehovah’s hand
when we see bad things happen

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either to us or to our brothers and sisters.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we may wonder,
‘How can we see Jehovah’s hand

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when bad things are happening?’

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can see my hand right now, right?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I put it away, you can’t see it.

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, do you assume
that because you can’t see my hand

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I don’t have a hand anymore?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You reason on the fact
that since you see the rest of me,

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s probably still my hand attached.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So likewise, there are times
when it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand,

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are other times
when we have to reason

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what we know about Jehovah
in order to see his hand in action.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s consider one thing.

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we know about Jehovah

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:13.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could reason
that his hand is in action?

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:17.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s reason on the point
that he is a “happy God.”

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does Jehovah stay happy,

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing all the bad things that are happening?

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve wondered that.
I know it’s crossed my mind.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah stay happy

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he sees
all the suffering that’s going on?

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:37.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And frankly, he sees <i>all </i> the suffering;

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:39.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sees everything going on.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know how I feel,
and you probably know how you feel

00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just when you read about what’s happening

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in Venezuela or in Russia

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with all of the hurricanes

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and earthquakes
that we’ve had in recent times.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:53.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we see the suffering

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only of our brothers and sisters
but also of other people,

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:58.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we consider,

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can Jehovah stay happy
when he knows all of what is happening?’

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider three
(I’m sure) of many reasons

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:09.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why Jehovah can stay happy
even though he knows all the suffering.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we can see
how that could benefit us as well.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his hand is hard at work
preparing the new world for us.

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think Jeremiah 29:11

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:25.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really covers how Jehovah feels

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the future for us.

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:30.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Jeremiah 29:11, he says:

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you,’

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:37.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah,
‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you a future and a hope.’”

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah
is not simply just watching events occur.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s actively working on the solution.

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He, along with Jesus and the heavenly angels,

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is working hard on the Kingdom.

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:58.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can’t see into heaven right now,

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:03.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I want you to just imagine
all the activity of the angels,

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resurrected anointed brothers,

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus working hard on making preparations

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Armageddon and the new world.

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think of all the work
we’re doing just to prepare

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the annual meeting and dedication.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine all the work
going on in heaven that is there?

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, how far along are the new scrolls?

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our basic needs 
as far as clean water,

00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food, and homes
going to be provided for the survivors?

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we can’t see into heaven,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that his hand is there.

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah is happy
because he’s actively working right now

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:42.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make things better for us.

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:44.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the lesson for us?

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be happy
when we see the suffering around us

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we know what Jehovah
and our brothers are doing up there

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for the new world.

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second point about how Jehovah can be happy

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:59.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that he can comfort us right now.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is happy when he can do that.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 12 of Jeremiah chapter 29,

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah continued after saying
that he was working on the future (he says): 

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:15.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you will call me
and come and pray to me,

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:17.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will listen to you.”

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I love this point
because Jehovah is saying,

00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry; I’m taking care
of building a better future for you.’

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate it.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re going through some trial
—some difficulty—

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a good friend of ours reminds us,

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember things are going
to get better in the future;

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to change this;
it’s going to get better,”

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is comforting.

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is also comforting 
(like Jehovah says here in verse 12)

00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:45.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the person says,
“What can I do for you right now?”

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is saying right now,
‘Come, pray to me.’

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is there to comfort and help us.

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could kind of illustrate
the way Jehovah feels

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by thinking about parents
and how they deal with a small child.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever seen a small child,
maybe two or three years of age,

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they fall really badly
and scrape their knees badly,

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are screaming in pain?

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s this red liquid leaking out of them.

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are distraught.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in that child’s mind,

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he may think: ‘This is the end of it.
This is the end of my life as I know it.

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m never going to recover from this.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to die.’

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for the parents, of course,
their perspective is different, isn’t it?

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they comfort the child;
they help to take care of the skinned knee.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They comfort them, and they tell them:
“You’re going to live.

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:37.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to be OK.
It’s going to be all right.”

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why can the parent have that view?

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:42.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they know that in a few hours maybe

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(at least in a week or so),

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the child is not even going to remember
that skinned knee.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to be just a very distant memory.

00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:53.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah also knows
that whatever we’re going through right now

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whatever suffering
we may be going through now—

00:05:56.806 --> 00:06:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that soon in that new world,
we aren’t going to recall that suffering.

00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:03.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he knows that he can solve
any problem we’re facing

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as easily as we heal from a scraped knee.

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows our whole eternal lives
are ahead of us.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:14.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he comforts us;
he listens to our heartfelt prayers.

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like a kind parent, he’s telling us

00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(through our brothers,
the Bible, and holy spirit),

00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You will live.’

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is happy
because right now, what can he do?

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can comfort us and help us.

00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is the lesson for us?

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can comfort and help others.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re, really, kind of all
in this “lifeboat” together,

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to make it to the “new-world shore,”

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can help one another.

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third,
his hand is patiently waiting

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:47.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the right time to act.

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is waiting patiently

00:06:50.126 --> 00:06:52.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the complete vindication
of his sovereignty.

00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:56.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love
what the June 2017 <i>Watchtower </i> article

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep Your Eyes on the Big Issue” said:

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:02.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us not become
so absorbed in our own lives

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we lose sight of this big issue

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let us appreciate
that our role in this vital issue

00:07:11.414 --> 00:07:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“entails remaining faithful

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under difficult circumstances.”

00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful quote to think about?

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows that by his being patient now,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and all his faithful servants
will never have to go through this again.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The issue of sovereignty
will be completely settled.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you admire Jehovah’s patience?

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:37.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, to watch all that is happening

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:42.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have the self-control
to wait for the appointed time

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is truly an example of patience in action.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about the different situations

00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:51.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters and others face

00:07:51.154 --> 00:07:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when a mother, for example,

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:57.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watches a handicapped son
struggle to walk or to talk

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a husband watches his wife
struggle to breathe—

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want so much at that moment

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to press that big, red,
“start-the-new-world” button now.

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you have that feeling,

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember our text for today:

00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The hand of Jehovah
will become known to his servants.”

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:23.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the lesson for us?

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:25.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep our eyes
on the big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just review those three points.

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:36.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we see Jehovah’s hand

00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be happy when we see
all of this suffering around us?

00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can be happy knowing

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah and Jesus
and the resurrected anointed

00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:48.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing right now
to prepare for the new world.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can be happy
because we have a role

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in comforting and helping others.

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:58.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can be happy being patient,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing why we’re being patient.

00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:05.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have our eyes
on that big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:09.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not always
be able to see Jehovah’s hand,

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can be sure,
as our text for today says,

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:18.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s hand is there,
and it will become known.

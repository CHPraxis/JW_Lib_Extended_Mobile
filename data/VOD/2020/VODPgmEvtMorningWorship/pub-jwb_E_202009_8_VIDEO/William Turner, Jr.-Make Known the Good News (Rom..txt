00:00:01 “How does it make you feel,
00:00:04 “knowing God’s support is real,
00:00:07 “and that he’s entrusted [us]
00:00:09 to do the work we do?”
00:00:11 We know that song.
00:00:13 We love that song.
00:00:15 But have you ever stopped to meditate on the lyrics?
00:00:19 How do we feel?
00:00:21 Because, really, it’s a tremendous, amazing privilege
00:00:25 that Jehovah has entrusted to his people
00:00:28 —the work of Kingdom preaching and disciple-making.
00:00:32 Now, while the work at Bethel contributes to the preaching work
00:00:36 in a very precious and unique way,
00:00:38 we still recognize it’s quite special
00:00:41 to be able to assist someone in the ministry
00:00:44 and watch them progress to the point of making a dedication
00:00:48 and symbolizing that by water baptism.
00:00:51 Our text comments mention the qualities
00:00:54 of gratitude and undeserved kindness.
00:00:57 And these are good qualities
00:00:59 because they’re qualities that motivate us,
00:01:02 that move us to action,
00:01:04 that touch our emotions.
00:01:06 Why is this emotional investment
00:01:09 so important when it comes to our ministry?
00:01:13 Well, think, for example,
00:01:16 of our greatest Teacher and Preacher
00:01:19 who ever walked the earth, and that is Jesus Christ.
00:01:22 Turn with me in your Bibles, please, to Luke chapter 19,
00:01:27 and we’ll just take a look at one instance
00:01:31 of how Jesus demonstrated this love and concern.
00:01:35 Luke 19:41
00:01:41 says: “And when he [that is, Jesus] got nearby,
00:01:46 “he viewed the city [Jerusalem]
00:01:50 and wept over it.”
00:01:54 How interesting!
00:01:56 Jesus’ heart was filled with so much emotion
00:02:00 that his eyes brimmed over with tears when he contemplated the people,
00:02:05 their rejection of the message,
00:02:08 the siege that was to follow.
00:02:10 Doesn’t that show his love for people?
00:02:12 And obviously, that love was made evident
00:02:15 the entire time that he was here on the earth.
00:02:18 Now, we may not give way to tears
00:02:20 every time we go into our territory and engage in the ministry,
00:02:24 but certainly we want to imitate Jesus’ example,
00:02:28 because it’s so vital that we have and demonstrate love for people.
00:02:33 It reminds me of a conversation I had with a missionary sister some time ago,
00:02:37 and at the time, she was revealing her personal circumstances.
00:02:40 And she felt that at that time
00:02:42 she could comfortably handle ten Bible studies.
00:02:45 So I asked her how things were going.
00:02:46 She said, “Well, actually I have 20.”
00:02:48 She said, “I was able to get rid of six.”
00:02:50 She said, “But I just can’t turn over these last four.”
00:02:54 She said, “They’re such a part of my life;
00:02:57 I just can’t let them go.”
00:03:00 Well, it sounds like a good problem to have.
00:03:03 But doesn’t it highlight her love for people?
00:03:06 She was emotionally invested.
00:03:10 Now, we also have to admit
00:03:12 that while preaching is a wonderful work,
00:03:16 actually carrying it out is not always easy to do.
00:03:21 Perhaps at times we may feel like the prophet Jeremiah.
00:03:25 You recall when he was commissioned as a prophet,
00:03:27 he gave Jehovah a number of reasons why he shouldn’t be selected.
00:03:31 He was too shy, too young, wasn’t able to speak well.
00:03:36 And then once he got into his assignment
00:03:38 and the opposition and the ridicule started
00:03:40 —well, let’s take note of his feelings.
00:03:42 Turn with me, please, to Jeremiah chapter 20,
00:03:51 Jeremiah chapter 20.
00:03:52 We’ll begin with the B  part of verse 8:
00:03:57 “For me the word of Jehovah
00:03:59 “has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.
00:04:03 “So I said: ‘I am not going to make mention of him,
00:04:08 and I will speak no more in his name.’”
00:04:14 Have you ever had times when you felt like Jeremiah,
00:04:18 when you just didn’t have the desire
00:04:21 or feel like speaking to others about Jehovah?
00:04:24 And maybe it was for similar reasons:
00:04:27 We’re shy; we feel nervous;
00:04:31 people in the territory are indifferent.
00:04:35 Or could it just be that we’re just tired?
00:04:39 The energy that we feel we need, we just don’t have it.
00:04:44 Is it normal to feel this way at times?
00:04:47 Absolutely.
00:04:49 But let’s take note of what Jeremiah says next.
00:04:52 Let’s finish verse 9.
00:04:54 He says: “But in my heart
00:04:57 “it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones,
00:05:01 “and I was tired of holding it in;
00:05:04 I could no longer endure it.”
00:05:07 You notice, it was Jeremiah’s love for Jehovah,
00:05:10 his zeal for the truth, his strong spirituality
00:05:13 —all of these were things that were able to help him remain invested
00:05:18 and be able to overcome any temporary discouragement
00:05:22 that he might have been feeling at that time.
00:05:26 So, what can help us to stay invested
00:05:28 and to maintain our love for people?
00:05:31 Well, there are many ways, but we’ll discuss two.
00:05:34 First, Jeremiah’s example shows us
00:05:38 that there is never a substitute
00:05:40 for the study of God’s Word.
00:05:43 Did you notice,
00:05:44 What was that ‘burning fire shut up in his bones’?
00:05:49 Verse 8 tells us it was “the word of Jehovah.”
00:05:54 So it was Jeremiah’s appreciation
00:05:56 for the importance of his message
00:05:59 that made him responsive
00:06:01 to the encouragement he received when he read God’s Word.
00:06:06 And it works the same for us as well.
00:06:09 Study of God’s Word helps to reinforce our love for Jehovah.
00:06:14 It’s a constant reminder that we’re living in the last days,
00:06:17 that we’re deep in the time of the end,
00:06:19 and that we need to do all that we can to find
00:06:21 those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
00:06:25 Yes, it is natural that we are going to experience
00:06:29 discouragement from time to time,
00:06:31 but when we pray to Jehovah for help,
00:06:34 you see, if his Word is in our hearts,
00:06:37 then Jehovah can freely impart his holy spirit to us.
00:06:41 He can give us what we need
00:06:43 to be bold preachers of the good news
00:06:46 and be productive in our ministry.
00:06:50 Now, the second thing that can help us
00:06:53 is applying the suggestions that are given to us
00:06:56 by the slave to help us improve our ministry.
00:07:00 Now, perhaps in the past,  preaching may have been difficult,
00:07:04 maybe just because of pressure we put upon ourselves.
00:07:07 Perhaps we may have felt that we had to have the perfect presentation
00:07:12 or we had to place a certain amount of literature.
00:07:15 But how loving it is that we see
00:07:17 that with the various adjustments that have been made in our ministry,
00:07:20 well, hopefully some of that anxiety has been lifted
00:07:23 because now we know our focus is on starting conversations!
00:07:28 And with the help of prayer and God’s spirit,
00:07:31 we can see how that just naturally progresses into a witness.
00:07:35 If we just think back for a moment to the example of Jesus,
00:07:38 we can only imagine how many preaching opportunities
00:07:41 Jesus must have had just from starting conversations.
00:07:46 Of course, the one we’re most familiar with is in John chapter 4
00:07:49 —the Samaritan woman at the well.
00:07:51 Not only was that a great witness
00:07:55 but just think about all of those who became believers afterward.
00:08:00 And all of that started simply from Jesus starting a conversation
00:08:05 —asking for water.
00:08:08 We may not always have as many opportunities at Bethel
00:08:11 to engage in the house-to-house work as we would like,
00:08:14 but certainly as we travel, as we move about,
00:08:17 this can present greater opportunities
00:08:20 to start conversations.
00:08:23 In last month’s meeting workbook, there was an article
00:08:26 “Starting Conversations That Can Lead to a Witness,”
00:08:29 and that article just provided many excellent, practical suggestions
00:08:34 that we can implement.
00:08:36 So if we follow these suggestions,
00:08:39 well, this is a nice way that we can show and demonstrate our gratitude.
00:08:43 We’re making the best use of our time to start a witness.
00:08:47 So, as we mentioned,
00:08:48 there are many ways that we can show our gratitude.
00:08:50 But certainly these two:
00:08:52 Our study of God’s Word and applying the suggestions to improve our ministry
00:08:57 are two ways that we can certainly implement.
00:09:00 So in imitation of Jesus, Jeremiah,
00:09:04 many other faithful Witnesses of Jehovah,
00:09:06 may we do what we can to show that we are invested,
00:09:10 that we show our love for God and our love for people
00:09:14 as we appreciatively carry out our commission to preach the good news.

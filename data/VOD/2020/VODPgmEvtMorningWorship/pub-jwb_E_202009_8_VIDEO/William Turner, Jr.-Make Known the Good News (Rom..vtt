“How does it make you feel,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“knowing God’s support is real,

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“and that he’s entrusted [us]

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.061 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to do the work we do?”

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We know that song.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We love that song.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:19.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But have you ever stopped
to meditate on the lyrics?

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we feel?

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because, really,
it’s a tremendous, amazing privilege

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has entrusted to his people

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the work of Kingdom preaching
and disciple-making.

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:36.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, while the work at Bethel
contributes to the preaching work

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:38.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very precious and unique way,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we still recognize it’s quite special

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to assist someone in the ministry

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch them progress
to the point of making a dedication

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and symbolizing that by water baptism.

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our text comments mention the qualities

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:57.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of gratitude and undeserved kindness.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:59.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these are good qualities

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:02.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’re qualities that motivate us,

00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that move us to action,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touch our emotions.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is this emotional investment

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:13.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so important when it comes to our ministry?

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think, for example,

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our greatest Teacher and Preacher

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:22.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who ever walked the earth,
and that is Jesus Christ.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me in your Bibles, please,
to Luke chapter 19,

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll just take a look at one instance

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:35.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how Jesus demonstrated
this love and concern.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 19:41

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says: “And when he
[that is, Jesus] got nearby,

00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he viewed the city [Jerusalem]

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wept over it.”

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How interesting!

00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ heart was filled with so much emotion

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his eyes brimmed over with tears
when he contemplated the people,

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their rejection of the message,

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the siege that was to follow.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that show his love for people?

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:15.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And obviously,
that love was made evident

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire time
that he was here on the earth.

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we may not give way to tears

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every time we go into our territory
and engage in the ministry,

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:28.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but certainly we want
to imitate Jesus’ example,

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s so vital that we have
and demonstrate love for people.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of a conversation I had
with a missionary sister some time ago,

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the time,
she was revealing her personal circumstances.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she felt that at that time

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she could comfortably handle
ten Bible studies.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked her how things were going.

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:48.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “Well, actually I have 20.”

00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:50.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “I was able to get rid of six.”

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said,
“But I just can’t turn over these last four.”

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “They’re such a part of my life;

00:02:57.994 --> 00:03:00.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just can’t let them go.”

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:03.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it sounds like a good problem to have.

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:06.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But doesn’t it highlight her love for people?

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was emotionally invested.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we also have to admit

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that while preaching is a wonderful work,

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually carrying it out
is not always easy to do.

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:25.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps at times we may feel
like the prophet Jeremiah.

00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:27.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recall when he
was commissioned as a prophet,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave Jehovah a number of reasons
why he shouldn’t be selected.

00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was too shy, too young,
wasn’t able to speak well.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then once he got into his assignment

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the opposition and the ridicule started

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well, let’s take note of his feelings.

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:45.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Jeremiah chapter 20,

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah chapter 20.

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll begin with the <i>B</i>  part of verse 8:

00:03:57.353 --> 00:03:59.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For me the word of Jehovah

00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has been the cause of insults
and jeering all day long.

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:08.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So I said:
‘I am not going to make mention of him,

00:04:08.298 --> 00:04:12.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will speak no more in his name.’”

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:18.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had times
when you felt like Jeremiah,

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you just didn’t have the desire

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or feel like speaking
to others about Jehovah?

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe it was for similar reasons:

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re shy; we feel nervous;

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people in the territory are indifferent.

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:39.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it just be that we’re just tired?

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The energy that we feel we need,
we just don’t have it.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it normal to feel this way at times?

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:49.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s take note
of what Jeremiah says next.

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:54.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s finish verse 9.

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“But in my heart

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it became like a burning fire
shut up in my bones,

00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I was tired of holding it in;

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could no longer endure it.”

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice,
it was Jeremiah’s love for Jehovah,

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his zeal for the truth,
his strong spirituality

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of these were things
that were able to help him remain invested

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be able to overcome
any temporary discouragement

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he might have been feeling at that time.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:28.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us to stay invested

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:31.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to maintain our love for people?

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are many ways,
but we’ll discuss two.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jeremiah’s example shows us

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is never a substitute

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the study of God’s Word.

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice,

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that ‘burning fire
shut up in his bones’?

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:54.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8 tells us
it was “the word of Jehovah.”

00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:56.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was Jeremiah’s appreciation

00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the importance of his message

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that made him responsive

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:06.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the encouragement
he received when he read God’s Word.

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it works the same for us as well.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:14.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Study of God’s Word
helps to reinforce our love for Jehovah.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a constant reminder
that we’re living in the last days,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re deep in the time of the end,

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we need to do
all that we can to find

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:25.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is natural
that we are going to experience

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:31.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discouragement from time to time,

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when we pray to Jehovah for help,

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, if his Word is in our hearts,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah can freely impart
his holy spirit to us.

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:43.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can give us what we need

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be bold preachers of the good news

00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:50.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be productive in our ministry.

00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second thing that can help us

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is applying the suggestions
that are given to us

00:06:56.632 --> 00:07:00.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the slave to help us improve our ministry.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, perhaps in the past, 
preaching may have been difficult,

00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:07.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe just because of pressure
we put upon ourselves.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:12.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we may have felt that we
had to have the perfect presentation

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:15.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we had to place
a certain amount of literature.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how loving it is that we see

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that with the various adjustments
that have been made in our ministry,

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, hopefully some
of that anxiety has been lifted

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now we know
our focus is on starting conversations!

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:31.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with the help of prayer and God’s spirit,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see how that
just naturally progresses into a witness.

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:38.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we just think back for a moment
to the example of Jesus,

00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can only imagine
how many preaching opportunities

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus must have had
just from starting conversations.

00:07:46.682 --> 00:07:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the one
we’re most familiar with is in John chapter 4

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Samaritan woman at the well.

Not only was that a great witness

00:07:55.124 --> 00:08:00.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just think about all of those
who became believers afterward.

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:05.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of that started simply
from Jesus starting a conversation

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—asking for water.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not always have
as many opportunities at Bethel

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to engage in the house-to-house work
as we would like,

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:17.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but certainly as we travel,
as we move about,

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this can present greater opportunities

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:23.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start conversations.

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:26.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In last month’s meeting workbook,
there was an article

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:29.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Starting Conversations
That Can Lead to a Witness,”

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:34.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that article just provided
many excellent, practical suggestions

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can implement.

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we follow these suggestions,

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:43.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, this is a nice way that we can show
and demonstrate our gratitude.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:47.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re making the best use
of our time to start a witness.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, as we mentioned,

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many ways
that we can show our gratitude.

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But certainly these two:

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:57.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our study of God’s Word and applying
the suggestions to improve our ministry

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:00.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are two ways that we can certainly implement.

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:04.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in imitation of Jesus, Jeremiah,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many other faithful Witnesses of Jehovah,

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:10.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we do what we can
to show that we are invested,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we show our love for God
and our love for people

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:19.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we appreciatively carry out
our commission to preach the good news.

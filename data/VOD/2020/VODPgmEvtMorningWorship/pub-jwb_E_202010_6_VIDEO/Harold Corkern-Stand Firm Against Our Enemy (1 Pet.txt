00:00:01 Our text highlights the fact
00:00:03 that we are at war with Satan.
00:00:06 War is defined
00:00:08 as “a state of hostility
00:00:11 “accompanied by actions
00:00:13 “to conquer or to destroy
00:00:15 those viewed as the enemy.”
00:00:18 And the context of our text today at 1 Peter 5:8
00:00:22 talks about the type of enemy we have
00:00:25 —“a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.”
00:00:30 And that expression “roaring” denotes
00:00:32 “the howl of a beast in fierce hunger.”
00:00:37 So we have a real enemy.
00:00:40 And that’s why the words of Jesus
00:00:42 are so meaningful for us when he gave the model prayer.
00:00:47 He said at Matthew 6:13:
00:00:49 “Do not bring us into temptation,
00:00:52 “but deliver [or, the footnote, “rescue”] us
00:00:56 from the wicked one.”
00:00:58 Now, other Bible translations,
00:01:00 like the King James Version or the Revised Standard Version,
00:01:04 use an expression like, “Deliver us from evil.”
00:01:09 Or the Contemporary English Version says:
00:01:11 “Protect us from evil.”
00:01:14 But that doesn’t convey the real fierceness of a real enemy, does it?
00:01:19 It’s more generic.
00:01:20 And so Jesus knew the Devil was real,
00:01:24 and he is a real enemy.
00:01:27 And the Devil has no remorse.
00:01:29 He’s fierce. He has no pity.
00:01:32 He will take a person and, with his traps and lures,
00:01:36 get him to do something bad in Jehovah’s eyes,
00:01:39 and then the person is overcome with guilt.
00:01:41 And then, like a fierce enemy,
00:01:43 the Devil comes along and stomps on him
00:01:45 and makes him feel worse because he caved in and sinned.
00:01:50 So how do we deal with such a powerful enemy?
00:01:55 Well, in war, there are soldiers.
00:01:58 So let’s use an expression
00:02:01 that the apostle Paul used to describe our situation.
00:02:04 Let’s open our Bibles, please, to the book of 2 Timothy.
00:02:08 In 2 Timothy chapter 2, we’re going to read verses 3 and 4
00:02:12 and talk for a few moments about our being soldiers.
00:02:17 Second Timothy 2:3:
00:02:19 “As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus,
00:02:22 “take your part in suffering adversity.
00:02:25 “No man serving as a soldier
00:02:27 “involves himself in the commercial businesses of life,
00:02:30 in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.”
00:02:36 We become soldiers of Christ
00:02:39 when we accept Jehovah’s arrangements
00:02:41 for salvation through Christ Jesus
00:02:43 and we dedicate our lives to him unreservedly
00:02:48 for our entire life.
00:02:50 We become a soldier and, like a soldier,
00:02:54 we know that it’s not going to be easy.
00:02:57 There are going to be hardships and trials.
00:03:00 And yet, a fine soldier
00:03:02 —his main objective is to stay loyal to his commanding officers
00:03:05 and to those who are giving instructions.
00:03:08 And likewise we know it’s not going to be easy.
00:03:11 It’s not easy, but we have chosen to become a soldier of Christ.
00:03:17 Now, a soldier, like this loyal one being described,
00:03:21 is far different from a mercenary.
00:03:23 A mercenary is one who hires himself out to fight,
00:03:27 but he may not have any devotion, really, to the cause.
00:03:30 He’s a hired man, and he’s doing it for the reward only
00:03:34 or for something else that he may gain.
00:03:37 But we’re not mercenaries.
00:03:39 We’re those with godly devotion,  wholly devoted to Jehovah
00:03:43 and loyal to Christ so that we can be fine soldiers,
00:03:47 loyal and true.
00:03:50 Now, another aspect of soldiers is that they are identified
00:03:54 by their distinctive uniforms
00:03:57 or their particular fighting equipment.
00:04:00 And that way, it helps to identify
00:04:02 who’s the friend and who’s the foe in the middle of the battle.
00:04:06 Their appearance makes that possible.
00:04:10 Well, today, there is a clear difference, isn’t there,
00:04:14 between the soldiers of Satan
00:04:17 and the soldiers of Christ?
00:04:20 There’s great enmity,  but there’s a sharp contrast
00:04:24 in appearance and attitude and disposition
00:04:27 and motivation and conduct.
00:04:31 And that’s why when we think about that,
00:04:33 we think about the contrast between “the works of the flesh”
00:04:37 described in Galatians chapter 5
00:04:39 and those who have the fruitage of God’s spirit.
00:04:42 There is such a strong distinction
00:04:45 between “one serving God and one not serving him.”
00:04:49 And that’s why, too,
00:04:51 we think about the type of armor we bear.
00:04:55 Ephesians chapter 6 says:
00:04:58 “Put on the complete suit of armor from God.”
00:05:02 So our very armor is from God.
00:05:04 We do not use the tactics and the methods of the Devil,
00:05:08 but we are clearly identified as a soldier of Christ.
00:05:13 And there can be no gray area here;
00:05:16 we’re either on one side or the other, correct?
00:05:18 For example, suppose that you’re a soldier,
00:05:21 and you’re on guard duty, and it’s evening,
00:05:25 and you see someone approaching, and you cry out:
00:05:28 “Halt! Who goes there?
00:05:30 Friend or foe?”
00:05:32 and you hear back, “I’m both.”
00:05:36 There’s an enemy.
00:05:39 You can’t be on both sides.
00:05:41 Now, what is another aspect of being a good soldier in this fight?
00:05:45 Well, let’s open our Bibles  to Philippians chapter 1,
00:05:49 Philippians chapter 1, and we get to the concept of unity
00:05:54 and working closely together in peace,
00:05:57 because an army needs to be unified.
00:06:01 Philippians 1:27 says:
00:06:04 “Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ,
00:06:08 “so that whether I come and see you or I am absent,
00:06:12 “I may hear about you and learn
00:06:15 “that you are standing firm in one spirit,
00:06:18 “with one soul [and the footnote, or “with one accord”],
00:06:24 “striving side by side for the faith of the good news,
00:06:28 “and in no way being frightened by your opponents.
00:06:32 “This very thing is a proof of destruction for them,
00:06:35 but of salvation for you; and this is from God.”
00:06:40 Well, we have this matter of unity —don’t we?—
00:06:43 shoulder to shoulder, side by side.
00:06:46 And yet, one of the tactics of the Devil
00:06:49 is to get us divided and disjointed
00:06:54 and fighting among ourselves.
00:06:58 To turn the enemy on itself is a very effective war strategy.
00:07:02 Even Jehovah used that —remember?—
00:07:04 against his enemies.
00:07:05 At 2 Chronicles 20:20-23,
00:07:10 there was the attack “of Ammon, Moab,
00:07:13 and the mountainous region of Seir” against Judah.
00:07:15 What did Jehovah do?
00:07:17 He confused them.
00:07:18 They struck down each other; they helped destroy one another.
00:07:24 And the Devil, in a very sinister way, uses that same approach.
00:07:28 How?
00:07:30 Well, if he can get us to not get along with each other
00:07:34 and turn on one another,
00:07:36 then that’s a very effective tactic.
00:07:39 In fact, we remember the expression
00:07:42 at Ephesians 4:26, 27 about getting along:
00:07:47 “Be wrathful, but do not sin;
00:07:50 “do not let the sun set while you are still angry;
00:07:53 do not give the Devil an opportunity.”
00:07:56 So when he sees discord and disunity,
00:08:00 he can really amplify that.
00:08:02 So we have to remember who our real enemies are.
00:08:06 Now, our brothers may disappoint us;  they may frustrate us;
00:08:10 they may hurt us at times because of imperfections.
00:08:13 But they’re not the enemy.
00:08:15 The Devil and his hordes —they are the enemies.
00:08:19 So we don’t get to fighting with the wrong person.
00:08:22 We keep in mind that our brothers are with us.
00:08:26 And, in this connection
00:08:28 (we just read it in that scripture in Philippians),
00:08:30 it talked about not being afraid.
00:08:33 And do you remember something about being afraid
00:08:36 when it related to a soldier in Israel’s army?
00:08:40 Deuteronomy 20:8 says:
00:08:43 “The officers should also ask the people,
00:08:46 “‘Who is fearful and fainthearted?
00:08:48 “‘He should return to his house,
00:08:50 so that he may not cause his brothers to lose heart as he has.’”
00:08:55 Well, we do have an effect on each other.
00:08:58 Can you imagine being in Joshua’s army,
00:09:01 getting ready to battle, and to your left is a soldier?
00:09:04 And as you’re about ready to leave for battle,
00:09:06 he says to you: “We’re going to die.
00:09:09 “We’re not going to come back.
00:09:11 Say goodbye to your family. This is it.”
00:09:14 Or he may say,
00:09:15 “I’m not sure Joshua has Jehovah’s backing like Moses did.”
00:09:19 All of that would be terrible.
00:09:21 And so anyone in that category was to go home
00:09:24 because they would have an effect on others.
00:09:26 How grateful, though, we are that we have positive, courageous brothers
00:09:30 who trust in Jehovah,
00:09:32 examples in the Bible, and also modern-day examples,
00:09:36 just like our brothers in Russia!
00:09:39 Well, as soldiers in this battle, we’re ‘not ignorant of Satan’s designs.’
00:09:44 And yet, he studies us very carefully, and he knows our weaknesses.
00:09:49 The September 1, 1988, Watchtower had an article
00:09:53 “Stand Firm Against Satan’s Machinations,”
00:09:57 and in that, it said the Devil knows what our weaknesses are.
00:10:01 But do we?
00:10:03 If we don’t identify them and then correct them,
00:10:06 we will be defenseless at times.
00:10:08 But it takes honesty and humility
00:10:11 and an earnest desire to address that which is bad.
00:10:14 Otherwise, we become a victim.
00:10:17 So we need to ask: ‘What are my weaknesses?
00:10:21 Do I identify them? Do I work on them?’
00:10:24 And yet, with Jehovah’s help, we can come off victorious in this battle.
00:10:28 First Peter 5:10 says that ‘Jehovah will finish our training;
00:10:32 he will make us firm; he will make us strong.’
00:10:34 So with Jehovah’s help, we can succeed.
00:10:38 So may we all continue as fine soldiers of Christ,
00:10:41 trusting in Jehovah,
00:10:43 and win the battle against the enemy—the Devil.

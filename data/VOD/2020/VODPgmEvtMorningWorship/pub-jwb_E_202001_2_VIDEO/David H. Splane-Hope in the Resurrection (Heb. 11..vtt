I’d like to invite you to take your booklet

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:07.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>Examining the Scriptures</i><i> </i>

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.293 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and focus on the second to the last

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:12.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
sentence in our comment.

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There’s quite a lot in there.

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:18.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s our November 8 comment,

00:00:18.702 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second to the last sentence.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and others like them
believed in the resurrection of the dead

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:36.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and looked forward to life
on earth under God’s Kingdom,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the city having real foundations.’”

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s a lot there.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take it apart

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how we can confirm

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one of those statements that’s made.

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:53.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the first statement?

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others like them
believed in the resurrection of the dead.”

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:05.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a pretty strong statement.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t see a clear teaching
of the resurrection in the book of Genesis.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just because Genesis doesn’t mention it

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t mean that these faithful men of old
didn’t know about the resurrection.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul tells us that they
were all looking forward to a reward

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a reward that they would receive,

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in their lifetime, but in the future.

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that would require a resurrection.

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:36.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the comment mentions Enoch.

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we know about him?

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Hebrews chapter 11,
and leave your Bibles open there, please,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re going to be reading
several verses in Hebrews.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11,

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:5,

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “By faith

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enoch was transferred
so as not to see death,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he was nowhere to be found
because God had transferred him;

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for before he was transferred

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:11.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, just before he died]

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:16.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he received the witness
that he had pleased God well.”

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at the end of his life,
he is told that he has pleased God well.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what?
No reward?

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t make sense.

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:29.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the clergy of Christendom
don’t believe that Enoch

00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:33.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needed a resurrection
because they don’t believe he died.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They focused on Paul’s words

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:38.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Enoch was transferred

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did not see death.

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:45.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is that Enoch did die.

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says so.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:53.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 5;
we’re talking about Enoch.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 7;
he’s talking about Noah.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8: Abraham.

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 11: Sarah.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, look at verse 13:

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:09.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In faith all [<i>all</i> ] of these died.”

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that would include Enoch, wouldn’t it?

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Enoch did die.

00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:17.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when it says “he was transferred,”

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:20.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it mean that he went
to heaven after he died?

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when was he baptized?

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:28.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t get to heaven
if he wasn’t baptized.

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:30.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was Abraham baptized?

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah?
Moses?

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:38.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Unless anyone is born of water and spirit,

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cannot enter the Kingdom of heaven.’

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, come to think of it, none of these
faithful men of old were baptized.

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of them were born of water and spirit,
so none of them could get to heaven.

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that confirms
the second part of our comment,

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:57.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says that they
“looked forward to life on earth

00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under God’s Kingdom,”

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were not born again.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they would have life on earth.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have covered, really,
the first two parts of our comment:

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:15.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fact that these men
did believe in the resurrection

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they were going
to be resurrected to life on earth.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, wait a minute, how do we know
that they believed in a resurrection?

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:27.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at verse 13 again,

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:31.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this time we’re going
to emphasize a little different word.

00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:35.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13:

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In faith

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[<i>in faith</i>] all of these died.”

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:46.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s Paul’s definition of “faith”?

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:50.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same chapter,
he says that the one who has faith

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘believes that God is the rewarder

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who are earnestly seeking him.’

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Paul says
that ‘all of these men died in faith,’

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he means that when they died,
they were looking forward to a reward

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:09.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that God was going to become their rewarder.

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in order for that to take place,

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:14.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would have
to have a resurrection, wouldn’t they?

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:16.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Abraham?

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He believed in the resurrection,
although he never saw one.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul mentions that in verses 17-19.

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “By faith Abraham,

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:33.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when he was tested,
as good as offered up Isaac

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—the man who had gladly
received the promises attempted

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to offer up his only-begotten son
—although it had been said to him:

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What will be called your offspring
will be through Isaac.’

00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he reasoned [he reasoned]

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:53.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God was able to raise
him up even from the dead

00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[he reasoned that God was able
to raise him up even from the dead],

00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did receive him
from there in an illustrative way.”

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do we know
that Abraham believed in the resurrection?

00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On what basis
can Paul say that Abraham ‘reasoned

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God was able to resurrect Isaac’?

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say?

00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The key is in verse 18.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God said to Abraham:

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What will be called your offspring

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be through Isaac.”

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:39.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, Abraham’s descendants
were going to come through Isaac,

00:06:39.382 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the time that Abraham
attempted to offer Isaac,

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaac didn’t have any offspring.

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word had to come true.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When God said that “your offspring
will be through Isaac,” it had to come true.

00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:57.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if God allowed Abraham
to go through with the sacrifice,

00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:01.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would have to resurrect Isaac

00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because ‘God cannot lie.’

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:08.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s a third part of our comment
that we were looking at,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it says that God’s Kingdom

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “the city having real foundations.”

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:19.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since when is a city a kingdom?

00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we draw that conclusion?

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when you come to think of it,

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:28.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even today there
are independent nations or kingdoms

00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are cities:

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Monaco, Singapore,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gibraltar, Vatican City.

00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:40.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But go further in Bible times;

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of cities were kingdoms.

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read about the king of Salem,

00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah.

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were cities, but the cities had kings.

00:07:51.687 --> 00:07:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul’s listeners or readers
would have understood

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:59.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(when he said they were
“awaiting the city having real foundations”)

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this was a kingdom.

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul makes another
powerful point in verse 35,

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we talk about whether
these faithful men of old

00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew about the resurrection or not.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 35, he says:

00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:16.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Women received their dead by resurrection,

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but other men were tortured

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they would not accept
release by some ransom,

00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order that they might
attain a better resurrection.”

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes sense, doesn’t it?

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would anybody
accept to be tortured to death

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he didn’t believe in a better life?

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these men accepted
to be persecuted and tortured

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they knew that something else
—something better—was coming,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would require a resurrection.

00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:50.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can heartily agree

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all of the points that are made

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:55.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this second to the last
sentence of our comment today:

00:08:55.418 --> 00:09:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham
and others like them

00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“believed in the resurrection of the dead

00:09:03.226 --> 00:09:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and looked forward to life
on earth under God’s Kingdom,

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:10.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the city having real foundations.’”

00:00:01 Welcome to our special
00:00:03 Morning Worship program
00:00:04 for the most important day of the year.
00:00:07 It’s a real privilege this morning
00:00:10 not just to speak to the Bethel family
00:00:12 but to be able to share some Scriptural thoughts
00:00:15 with the majority of our dear brothers and sisters
00:00:18 right around the world, including you
00:00:21 wherever you may be this morning.
00:00:24 All of us are looking forward with excitement to this evening,
00:00:28 when we unitedly remember the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
00:00:32 But first, let’s start by reading
00:00:35 the scripture text selected for today.
00:00:38 We’re going to ask Brother David Schafer,
00:00:40 a helper to the Teaching Committee,
00:00:42 to read for us this morning.
00:00:44 Please, David, let’s have the scripture text read.
00:00:48 Tuesday, April 7, 2020
00:00:52 —the Memorial date after sundown.
00:00:55 The text is taken from Romans 5:8:
00:01:00 “Christ died for us.”
00:01:04 Thank you, David.
00:01:06 Imagine, please, that you are in a prison cell.
00:01:10 You’ve just been notified
00:01:12 that you will be executed in the morning because of your faith.
00:01:16 There is no further means of appeal.
00:01:18 The decision is final.
00:01:21 How will you spend this last night?
00:01:24 What will you do?
00:01:26 What will you think about?
00:01:29 Some of our brothers and sisters in the past
00:01:32 have found themselves in this challenging situation.
00:01:36 Many of these used their last night
00:01:39 to write letters to strengthen and comfort
00:01:41 their friends and relatives.
00:01:44 For example, consider the courageous words
00:01:48 written by one young brother to his family
00:01:50 as he awaited death at the hands of Nazi persecutors.
00:01:55 He wrote: “It is already past midnight.
00:02:00 “I still have time to change my mind.
00:02:03 “Ah! could I be happy again in this world
00:02:06 “after I had denied our Lord?
00:02:09 “Surely not!
00:02:11 “But now you have the assurance
00:02:13 that I leave this world in happiness and peace.”
00:02:19 Notice, this dear brother didn’t use
00:02:22 that final evening just to focus on his own hardships.
00:02:26 Rather, he used part of that evening
00:02:29 to encourage those whom he loved.
00:02:31 He wanted to strengthen them
00:02:34 so that they wouldn’t be overwhelmed
00:02:36 by the sad news of his death.
00:02:39 Well, with these thoughts in mind,
00:02:41 let’s now think about how Jesus spent his last evening
00:02:45 as a human here on earth.
00:02:48 To start with, let’s ask this question:
00:02:52 By the time of that evening,
00:02:55 what did Jesus know about the circumstances of his death?
00:03:00 To answer that question,
00:03:02 let’s read together what’s stated in Matthew chapter 20.
00:03:07 So if you turn with me, please,
00:03:09 to Matthew 20:18, 19,
00:03:14 Jesus said:
00:03:16 “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem,
00:03:19 “and the Son of man will be handed over
00:03:22 “to the chief priests and the scribes.
00:03:25 “They will condemn him to death
00:03:27 “and hand him over to men of the nations
00:03:30 “to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake;
00:03:34 and on the third day he will be raised up.”
00:03:39 So on that final evening,
00:03:41 what did Jesus already know about his death,
00:03:44 and what would he have been thinking about?
00:03:48 These verses that we just read
00:03:50 mention four things.
00:03:53 First of all, it tells us that he knew
00:03:56 he would be handed over to the Jewish religious leaders
00:03:59 who would take him to court and find him guilty of a crime,
00:04:03 perhaps one including the charge of blasphemy.
00:04:08 Second, Jesus knew that he would be handed over
00:04:12 to “men of the nations” (in other words, the Romans),
00:04:16 and that they would violently abuse him.
00:04:20 Third, he knew that he would be executed on a stake.
00:04:25 And the final point,
00:04:27 he realized that he would be resurrected on the third day.
00:04:32 So on that final evening,
00:04:34 Jesus already knew some of the details concerning his death,
00:04:38 and these would have weighed heavily on his mind.
00:04:42 But were there any other things that he already knew?
00:04:46 Yes.
00:04:47 Let’s consider another three facts that were on his mind that evening.
00:04:52 The first one we’ll notice
00:04:54 if we turn to the book of John this time.
00:04:57 In John chapter 13,
00:04:59 we’re going to start by reading verse 21:
00:05:05 “After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit,
00:05:10 “and he bore witness, saying:
00:05:12 ‘Most truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.’”
00:05:17 Now if we turn across to verse 26,
00:05:20 it tells us that Jesus continued to say:
00:05:24 “‘It is the one to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip.’
00:05:29 “So after dipping the bread, he took it
00:05:32 and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.”
00:05:37 Jesus knew that one of his apostles would betray him,
00:05:41 and he even knew who his betrayer would be.
00:05:45 Now for something else that Jesus knew,
00:05:48 let’s read verse 38 of the same chapter
00:05:51 —John 13:38.
00:05:56 Jesus here said to Peter:
00:05:58 “Will you surrender your life in my behalf?
00:06:02 “Most truly I say to you, a rooster will by no means crow
00:06:07 until you have disowned me three times.”
00:06:11 So Jesus also knew that Peter would deny him three times.
00:06:17 And for another point, let’s turn to John chapter 16
00:06:22 —John 16:32.
00:06:27 Here, speaking to his apostles, Jesus said:
00:06:31 “Look! The hour is coming,
00:06:33 “indeed, it has come,
00:06:35 “when each one of you will be scattered to his own house
00:06:39 and you will leave me alone.”
00:06:42 So Jesus also realized that the rest of his apostles
00:06:46 would run away and desert him.
00:06:49 So, what did Jesus have on his mind that evening?
00:06:53 Not only would Jesus have been thinking
00:06:55 about his upcoming court trial, persecution,
00:06:59 and execution but he also knew
00:07:02 that he would be betrayed,
00:07:05 denied, and abandoned.
00:07:09 Now, if you were Jesus,
00:07:12 how would you have reacted to this knowledge?
00:07:15 Perhaps you would have preferred to be by yourself,
00:07:19 avoiding those who would fail you.
00:07:21 You might have thought,
00:07:23 ‘It’s better for me to spend the evening in prayer
00:07:26 —preparing properly— without these negative distractions.’
00:07:31 Just think about it:
00:07:33 Despite all these negative things,
00:07:36 Jesus didn’t hide away and stay by himself.
00:07:39 In fact, he told his apostles that he “greatly desired”
00:07:44 to celebrate this last Passover with them.
00:07:47 In other words, he wasn’t going to “miss the meeting”
00:07:51 because of these negative things.
00:07:54 Amazingly, even with all these things on his mind,
00:07:59 Jesus focused on how to help his faithful apostles.
00:08:03 He loved them, and he wanted to prepare them
00:08:06 for what was about to happen.
00:08:09 In fact, in John’s account,
00:08:11 five chapters are devoted to Jesus’ final words
00:08:14 of encouragement to his apostles.
00:08:17 What an amazing, unselfish love Jesus showed!
00:08:23 Just imagine, Jesus took the time
00:08:26 to wash the feet of his apostles,
00:08:29 even the feet of his betrayer, Judas Iscariot.
00:08:33 Not only were the apostles unwilling to do this lowly service
00:08:37 but when Jesus started to wash their feet,
00:08:39 not one of them stood up and offered to take over.
00:08:43 Yes, they had a real problem with their attitude.
00:08:46 That was further shown by the fact
00:08:48 that they had an argument that evening
00:08:51 about who was the greatest among them.
00:08:54 But do we see the evidence of Jesus’ love in all of this?
00:08:58 He didn’t give up on them.
00:09:01 Jesus didn’t allow these failures
00:09:04 to cause him to have a negative view of his apostles.
00:09:07 Instead, he commended his 11 faithful apostles
00:09:11 and even made a covenant with them to be part of his Kingdom.
00:09:15 Isn’t that truly amazing?
00:09:18 Additionally, Jesus earnestly prayed to Jehovah
00:09:22 not only to watch over those apostles
00:09:25 but also to care for those who would later believe in him
00:09:29 —that includes us today.
00:09:32 Despite all the negative things on his mind,
00:09:36 Jesus focused on strengthening others and praying for them.
00:09:41 What an expression of unselfish love!
00:09:46 This evening, we’ll be focusing on the love
00:09:49 Jehovah and Jesus expressed for us.
00:09:52 But as we meditate on the events of Nisan 14,
00:09:56 let’s also remember how Jesus proved his love
00:10:00 for his apostles by not giving up on them.
00:10:03 Even at a time when his thoughts would have been focused
00:10:07 on the excruciating death that lay ahead of him,
00:10:10 he patiently helped them
00:10:12 so that they could deal with what was about to happen.
00:10:17 What lessons can we learn from this?
00:10:20 Well, this may not be the last night of our life,
00:10:23 and we may not expect to be executed tomorrow.
00:10:27 But how can we imitate the love
00:10:30 that Jesus displayed that final evening?
00:10:33 Here are some things we can all be determined to do:
00:10:37 Don’t give up on our brothers and sisters,
00:10:40 even if at times they seem to fail us.
00:10:43 Continue to strengthen others,
00:10:46 even when we are facing difficulties.
00:10:50 In this way, we will also prove our genuine love
00:10:54 for Jehovah and his loving Son, Jesus Christ.
00:10:58 Now, David, let’s have our comments read.
00:11:02 “Jesus was willing not only to die for his disciples
00:11:06 “but also to live each day in a way that put their interests ahead of his own.
00:11:10 “For instance, he met with his followers
00:11:12 “even when he was physically tired or emotionally distressed.
00:11:16 “And he focused on what he could give to others,
00:11:18 “not on what he could get from them.
00:11:21 “We belong to the only true Christian brotherhood,
00:11:24 “and we enjoy spending as much time as possible
00:11:27 “inviting new ones to join us.
00:11:29 “However, we are particularly interested
00:11:31 “in helping those who are ‘related to us in the faith’
00:11:34 “but who have become inactive.
00:11:37 “We prove our love for them by encouraging them to attend our meetings,
00:11:41 “especially the Memorial.
00:11:44 “Like Jehovah and Jesus,
00:11:46 we are deeply moved when an inactive one returns to Jehovah.”
00:11:52 Thank you, David, for reading for us this morning.
00:11:55 Now we’re going to turn our attention
00:11:57 to our scheduled Bible reading for this morning.
00:12:08 “Now on the first day of the Unleavened Bread,
00:12:11 “when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice,
00:12:16 “his disciples said to him:
00:12:18 “‘Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?’
00:12:22 “With that
00:12:24 “he sent two of his disciples and said to them:
00:12:27 “‘Go into the city,
00:12:29 “‘and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you.
00:12:33 “‘Follow him, and wherever he goes inside,
00:12:37 “‘say to the master of the house,
00:12:39 “‘“The Teacher says:
00:12:41 “‘“‘Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
00:12:46 “‘“And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready.
00:12:50 “Prepare it for us there.’”
00:12:53 “So the disciples went out,
00:12:55 “and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them,
00:13:00 and they prepared for the Passover.”
00:13:09 “On the first day of the Unleavened Bread,
00:13:12 “the disciples came to Jesus, saying:
00:13:15 “‘Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?’
00:13:19 “He said: ‘Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him,
00:13:24 “‘“The Teacher says: ‘My appointed time is near;
00:13:29 “I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.’”’
00:13:33 “So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them
00:13:36 and prepared for the Passover.”
00:13:44 “After evening had fallen,
00:13:47 “he came with the Twelve.
00:13:51 “And as they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said:
00:13:55 “‘Truly I say to you, one of you
00:13:58 “who is eating with me will betray me.’
00:14:02 “They began to be grieved
00:14:04 “and to say to him one by one:
00:14:08 “‘It is not I, is it?’
00:14:11 “He said to them:
00:14:14 “‘It is one of the Twelve, the one dipping with me into the bowl.
00:14:18 “‘For the Son of man is going away, just as it is written about him,
00:14:23 “‘but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!
00:14:28 “It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.’
00:14:35 “And as they continued eating,
00:14:38 “he took a loaf, said a blessing,
00:14:41 “broke it, and gave it to them, saying:
00:14:45 “‘Take it; this means my body.’
00:14:50 “And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them,
00:14:54 “and they all drank out of it.
00:14:57 “And he said to them:
00:14:59 “‘This means my “blood of the covenant,”
00:15:02 “‘which is to be poured out in behalf of many.
00:15:06 “‘Truly I say to you, I will by no means drink anymore
00:15:10 “‘of the product of the vine until that day
00:15:13 “when I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.’
00:15:17 “Finally, after singing praises,
00:15:21 “they went out to the Mount of Olives
00:15:25 “And Jesus said to them:
00:15:27 “‘You will all be stumbled, for it is written:
00:15:31 “‘“I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered about.”
00:15:36 “‘But after I have been raised up,
00:15:38 “I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’
00:15:41 “But Peter said to him:
00:15:44 “‘Even if all the others are stumbled, I will not be.’
00:15:48 “At that Jesus said to him:
00:15:52 “‘Truly I say to you that today, yes,
00:15:55 “‘on this very night, before a rooster crows twice,
00:16:00 “you will disown me three times.’
00:16:03 “But he kept insisting:
00:16:07 “‘If I have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.’
00:16:11 “Also, all the others began to say the same thing.
00:16:18 “So they came to a spot named Gethsemane,
00:16:21 “and he said to his disciples:
00:16:24 “‘Sit down here while I pray.’
00:16:27 “And he took Peter and James and John along with him,
00:16:32 “and he began to feel deeply distressed
00:16:35 “and to be greatly troubled.
00:16:37 “He said to them:
00:16:40 “‘I am deeply grieved, even to death.
00:16:44 “‘Stay here and keep on the watch.’
00:16:48 “And going a little way forward,
00:16:52 “he fell to the ground and began praying that,
00:16:55 “if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
00:17:00 “And he said:
00:17:03 “‘Abba, Father, all things are possible for you;
00:17:08 “‘remove this cup from me.
00:17:11 “Yet, not what I want, but what you want.’
00:17:16 “He returned and found them sleeping,
00:17:21 “and he said to Peter:
00:17:23 “‘Simon, are you sleeping?
00:17:26 “‘Did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour?
00:17:31 “‘Keep on the watch and pray continually,
00:17:35 “‘so that you do not come into temptation.
00:17:38 “‘The spirit, of course, is eager,
00:17:41 “but the flesh is weak.’
00:17:45 “And he went away again and prayed,
00:17:47 “saying the same thing.
00:17:50 “And he came again and found them sleeping,
00:17:53 “for their eyes were weighed down,
00:17:56 “so they did not know what to answer him.
00:18:00 “And he returned the third time and said to them:
00:18:04 “‘At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting!
00:18:09 “‘It is enough! The hour has come!
00:18:13 “‘Look! The Son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
00:18:18 “‘Get up, let us go.
00:18:21 “Look! My betrayer has drawn near.’
00:18:26 “And immediately, while he was still speaking,
00:18:29 “Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived
00:18:33 “and with him a crowd with swords and clubs,
00:18:37 “sent from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
00:18:42 “Now his betrayer had given them an agreed sign, saying:
00:18:48 “‘Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one;
00:18:52 “take him into custody, and lead him away under guard.’
00:18:56 “And he came straight up and approached him
00:19:01 “and said, ‘Rabbi!’
00:19:04 “and gave him a tender kiss.
00:19:08 “So they seized him and took him into custody.
00:19:12 “However, one of those standing by drew his sword
00:19:17 “and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.
00:19:21 “But in response Jesus said to them:
00:19:26 “‘Did you come out to arrest me
00:19:28 “‘with swords and clubs as against a robber?
00:19:32 “‘Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching,
00:19:35 “‘and yet you did not take me into custody.
00:19:38 “Nevertheless, this is to fulfill the Scriptures.’
00:19:43 “And they all abandoned him and fled.
00:19:49 “However, a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment
00:19:54 “over his naked body  began to follow him nearby,
00:19:58 “and they tried to seize him,
00:20:00 “but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked.
00:20:06 “They now led Jesus away to the high priest,
00:20:10 “and all the chief priests and the elders
00:20:13 “and the scribes assembled.
00:20:15 “But Peter, from a good distance, followed him
00:20:20 “as far as into the courtyard of the high priest;
00:20:23 “and he was sitting together with the house attendants
00:20:26 “and warming himself before a bright fire.
00:20:32 “Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin
00:20:34 “were looking for testimony against Jesus
00:20:37 “in order to put him to death, but they were not finding any.
00:20:41 “Many, indeed, were giving false witness against him,
00:20:46 “but their testimonies were not in agreement.
00:20:52 “Also, certain ones were standing up
00:20:53 “and bearing false witness against him, saying:
00:20:57 “‘We heard him say, “I will throw down this temple
00:21:02 “‘“that was made with hands, and in three days
00:21:05 “I will build another not made with hands.”’
00:21:08 “But even on these grounds,
00:21:11 “their testimony was not in agreement.
00:21:16 “Then the high priest stood up in their midst
00:21:18 “and questioned Jesus, saying:
00:21:21 “‘Do you say nothing in reply?
00:21:24 “What is it these men  are testifying against you?’
00:21:27 “But he kept silent and made no reply at all.
00:21:33 “Again the high priest began to question him and said to him:
00:21:38 “‘Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed One?’
00:21:43 “Then Jesus said:
00:21:46 “‘I am; and you will see the Son of man
00:21:50 “sitting at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven.’
00:21:57 “At this the high priest ripped his garments and said:
00:22:01 “‘What further need do we have of witnesses?
00:22:05 “You heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?’
00:22:09 “They all condemned him as deserving of death.
00:22:14 “And some started to spit on him
00:22:17 “and to cover his face
00:22:19 “and hit him with their fists and say to him:
00:22:23 “‘Prophesy!’
00:22:25 “And slapping him in the face, the court attendants took him.
00:22:31 “Now while Peter was below in the courtyard,
00:22:35 “one of the servant girls of the high priest came.
00:22:38 “On seeing Peter warming himself,
00:22:41 “she looked straight at him and said:
00:22:45 “‘You too were with the Nazarene, this Jesus.’
00:22:49 “But he denied it, saying:
00:22:52 “‘Neither do I know him nor do I understand what you are talking about,’
00:22:57 “and he went outside to the entryway.
00:23:03 “There the servant girl saw him and again began to say to those standing by:
00:23:08 “‘This is one of them.’
00:23:10 “Again he was denying it.
00:23:13 “And after a little while,
00:23:15 “those standing by again began saying to Peter:
00:23:19 “‘Certainly you are one of them,
00:23:22 “for you are, in fact, a Galilean.’
00:23:26 “But he started to curse and swear:
00:23:29 “‘I do not know this man of whom you speak!’
00:23:34 “Immediately a rooster crowed a second time,
00:23:38 “and Peter recalled what Jesus had said to him:
00:23:43 “‘Before a rooster crows twice,
00:23:46 “you will disown me three times.’
00:23:50 And he broke down and began to weep.”
00:23:57 We’re sure that those verses have helped
00:24:00 to prepare us for the Memorial this evening.
00:24:04 But before we finish,
00:24:06 we’d like to assure you that the Governing Body loves you all.
00:24:11 Wherever you may be this evening,
00:24:13 no matter what challenges you may face,
00:24:16 it’s our heartfelt wish
00:24:18 that Jehovah will richly bless you all.
00:24:22 May our united efforts to be at the Memorial this evening
00:24:25 bring praise to our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah,
00:24:29 and his Son, Jesus Christ!

Jeremiah 2:13:

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:06.389 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“My people . . . have abandoned me,

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.158 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“the source of living water,

00:00:08.158 --> 00:00:09.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“and dug for themselves . . .

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.”

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.597 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, we often may think,

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How is it possible that Jehovah’s people

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—after all they saw, all they experienced—

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:23.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could leave Jehovah
and look for wisdom and support elsewhere?’

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, it happened over and over again.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a lesson and a warning for us?

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:31.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, there is.

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we appreciate so much
all of the spiritual provisions

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:37.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re receiving from Jehovah
through his organization.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Travel all around the world,
and our brothers and sisters

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
say they have never felt closer
to Jehovah’s organization than they do now.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re receiving life-giving waters
of truth as we never have before.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even so, just as in Jeremiah’s time,
some of our dear brothers and sisters

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:58.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are leaving Jehovah or have left Jehovah

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the pure waters of truth
and pursued worthless things.

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:04.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can that happen?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we make sure
that does not happen to us?

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:10.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you notice the point
in our text comment, the first two sentences?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says this; it says:
“Satan the Devil is intent on neutralizing

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:18.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the lifesaving guidance
we receive from Jehovah.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, our own ‘treacherous heart’

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:26.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could interfere with how well
we respond to Jehovah’s directives.”

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:28.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I think of the statements

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“treacherous heart”
and ‘how we respond to Jehovah’s directives’—

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot help but think of Solomon.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know Solomon’s account,
how Jehovah blessed him

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—gave him everything
he needed to be obedient—

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:43.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Solomon ended up losing
his precious record with Jehovah.

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He abandoned “the source of living water.”

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Solomon started off so well.

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened to him?

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, exactly what our text
is talking about here today.

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:55.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allowed his treacherous heart to interfere

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:58.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s directives.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the directives that Jehovah
gave Solomon were very, very clear.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:05.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at, for example, Deuteronomy chapter 17.

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we remember, as the king,
he was supposed to read this law

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a regular basis and write
this law on a regular basis.

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:16.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 17:16, 17

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:19.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it says: “However, he [in the context,
it’s talking about the king]

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should not acquire many horses for himself.”

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:27.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 17: “Neither should he take
many wives for himself,

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that his heart may not go astray;

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor should he acquire
vast amounts of silver and gold for himself.”

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not acquire horses, wives,

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:39.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vast amounts of silver and gold.

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon did all three.

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look at Deuteronomy 7:3, 4,

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there Jehovah says:
‘Do not form marriage alliances

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the nations
because they will lead you astray.’

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Solomon do?

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look over in 1 Kings chapter 11,

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look at verses 1-3.

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:02.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Kings 11:1-3—it says:

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:05.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But King Solomon loved many foreign women

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:07.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“besides the daughter of Pharaoh:

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite,
Sidonian, and Hittite women.

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were from the nations
about whom Jehovah said to the Israelites:

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You must not go in among them,

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:20.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they should not come in among you,

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for they will surely incline
your heart to follow their gods.’

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Solomon clung to them and loved them.

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he had 700 wives who were princesses

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and 300 concubines,

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his wives gradually inclined his heart”
—just as Jehovah said.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did this happen?

00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon did not just fall into sin.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:44.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon just didn’t, in a moment of weakness—

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t just wake up one day
and realize, “Oh my word,

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:48.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have 700 wives and 300 concubines!”

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he did, Solomon had more problems
than we thought he did.

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Solomon was an intelligent man.

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a man who was blessed
by Jehovah with wisdom.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he deviate so far?

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:04.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was a series of decisions
—one after another—

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that differed from Jehovah’s directives

00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that somehow he was able to explain away,

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:15.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rationalize away, until he was
completely alienated from Jehovah.

00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t know

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:21.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was going through Solomon’s mind
or how he made those decisions,

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:23.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even from our limited perspective,

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see how that could have happened.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he starts off talking
about the daughter of Pharaoh.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he took the daughter
of Pharaoh as a wife.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, interestingly, in 1 Kings chapter 3,

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it relates how Jehovah granted him
all the wisdom and blessed him.

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:42.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was after he had taken
the daughter of Pharaoh as a wife.

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is it possible that Solomon thought,

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:47.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, you know, Jehovah still blessed me;
this must mean everything is OK’?

00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Solomon knew something
wasn’t quite right there

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:52.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because at 2 Chronicles 8:11,

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:54.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says he had
to build another house for her.

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She couldn’t live in the house
of David because of the Ark.

00:04:57.947 --> 00:04:58.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was holy.

00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:01.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was a foreigner and couldn’t live there.

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew something wasn’t quite right.

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:08.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was able to make the decision
and rationalize it away anyway.

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:11.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that he loved the Moabite women.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we know, the Moabites
were enemies of Jehovah, but not all of them.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may remember
that when David

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:21.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was on the run from King Saul,

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he asked the king of Moab

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:26.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he could bring his father and mother

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:29.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—David’s father and mother—
there, and the king of Moab protected them.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did so the whole time that David
was in the stronghold, the account says.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means the king of Moab

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protected Solomon’s grandparents.

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also remember Ruth.

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Ruth
was Solomon’s great-great-grandmother,

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:48.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was a Moabite woman,
and look how well that turned out.

00:05:48.364 --> 00:05:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also men from Moab and Ammon

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were part of David’s mighty men.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they weren’t all bad.

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was it perhaps through David’s mighty men

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe from his grandparents,
who stayed in Moab, 

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was introduced
to some of his first wives from Moab?

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It talks about Ammonite women.

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:12.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we remember Solomon’s son Rehoboam,
who later became king.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was born from an Ammonite woman.

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:20.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, interestingly, he was born
before Solomon became king.

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, again, is it possible

00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:24.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Solomon reasoned:
‘Well, Jehovah is blessing me.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve got an Egyptian wife
and an Ammonite wife.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:30.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe this doesn’t apply to me
like it does to everybody else.’

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Sidonians?

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know the Sidonians
were famous for their craftsmanship.

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had outstanding abilities
as loggers and lumbermen.

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Solomon’s father, David,

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used the Sidonians to bring lumber

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in great quantity for the temple.

00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:49.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon later established contracts

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Sidonians
to cut trees for the temple.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:56.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, was it through, possibly,
some of these business relationships

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:59.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he first was introduced
to some who became his wives?

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could he have reasoned: ‘Well, you know,
marrying these Sidonian women—

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, that will help ensure
that Jehovah’s house is completed.

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will help me fulfill
my theocratic assignment.’

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just one more:
What about the Hittite women?

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:16.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we remember Uriah.

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David committed adultery with Bath-sheba

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had Uriah put to death.

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bath-sheba became Solomon’s mother.

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:30.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uriah was a Hittite
and one of David’s mighty men.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means Solomon’s mother

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:35.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been married to a Hittite man.

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:40.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is it perhaps through Bath-sheba,
through her former in-laws,

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps through others
that Solomon was introduced

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to some of his first wives from the Hittites?

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:49.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t know what Solomon was thinking,

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can see how it was possible for him

00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to begin to rationalize
some of those early decisions

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until he found himself on a slippery slope,

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely alienated from Jehovah.

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson for us?

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:07.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we read this account of Solomon

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—accumulating all of those wives,
all of the riches, all of those horses—

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s like watching
a car crash in slow motion.

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:18.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know exactly where it’s heading,
but Solomon didn’t see it coming.

00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question we have to ask ourselves is,

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What would the reaction be

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if somebody was reading
my life story right now

00:08:27.657 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the decisions that I am making
day to day right now?’

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, our heart, too, is treacherous.

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heart will try to cause us

00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rationalize away
Jehovah’s clear directives.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we may rationalize a decision

00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we see we’re still getting
blessings from Jehovah,

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:50.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe we rationalize
a decision because we see

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how it worked out for somebody else

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what somebody else is doing—dangerous.

00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:58.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?

00:08:58.354 --> 00:09:01.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we need to do what Solomon said
and should have done himself.

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:05.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn to Proverbs 3:5,

00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s turn there together, Proverbs 3:5.

00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Trust in Jehovah
with all your heart,

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:23.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not rely on your own understanding.”

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not rely on your own understanding”
—on our own wisdom.

00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:30.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah”; follow his direction.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we do, we can be assured
that we will never abandon

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the source of living water,”

00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:40.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather, we’ll benefit
from his guidance for all eternity.

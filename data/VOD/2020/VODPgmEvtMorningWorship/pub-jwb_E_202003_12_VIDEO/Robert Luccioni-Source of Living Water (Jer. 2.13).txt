00:00:01 Jeremiah 2:13:
00:00:04 “My people . . . have abandoned me,
00:00:06 “the source of living water,
00:00:08 “and dug for themselves . . .
00:00:09 broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.”
00:00:12 Now, we often may think,
00:00:14 ‘How is it possible that Jehovah’s people
00:00:16 ‘—after all they saw, all they experienced—
00:00:18 could leave Jehovah and look for wisdom and support elsewhere?’
00:00:23 And yet, it happened over and over again.
00:00:25 Is there a lesson and a warning for us?
00:00:28 Well, yes, there is.
00:00:31 Today, we appreciate so much all of the spiritual provisions
00:00:34 that we’re receiving from Jehovah through his organization.
00:00:37 Travel all around the world, and our brothers and sisters
00:00:40 say they have never felt closer to Jehovah’s organization than they do now.
00:00:45 We’re receiving life-giving waters of truth as we never have before.
00:00:50 But even so, just as in Jeremiah’s time, some of our dear brothers and sisters
00:00:55 are leaving Jehovah or have left Jehovah
00:00:58 and the pure waters of truth and pursued worthless things.
00:01:02 How can that happen?
00:01:04 How do we make sure that does not happen to us?
00:01:06 Well, did you notice the point in our text comment, the first two sentences?
00:01:10 It says this; it says: “Satan the Devil is intent on neutralizing
00:01:15 “the lifesaving guidance we receive from Jehovah.
00:01:18 “Moreover, our own ‘treacherous heart’
00:01:21 could interfere with how well we respond to Jehovah’s directives.”
00:01:26 Now, when I think of the statements
00:01:28 —“treacherous heart” and ‘how we respond to Jehovah’s directives’—
00:01:31 I cannot help but think of Solomon.
00:01:33 Now, we know Solomon’s account, how Jehovah blessed him
00:01:36 —gave him everything he needed to be obedient—
00:01:38 but Solomon ended up losing his precious record with Jehovah.
00:01:43 He abandoned “the source of living water.”
00:01:46 Now, Solomon started off so well.
00:01:48 What happened to him?
00:01:49 Well, exactly what our text is talking about here today.
00:01:52 He allowed his treacherous heart to interfere
00:01:55 with Jehovah’s directives.
00:01:58 Now, the directives that Jehovah gave Solomon were very, very clear.
00:02:01 Look at, for example, Deuteronomy chapter 17.
00:02:05 And as we remember, as the king, he was supposed to read this law
00:02:08 on a regular basis and write this law on a regular basis.
00:02:12 Deuteronomy 17:16, 17
00:02:16 —it says: “However, he [in the context, it’s talking about the king]
00:02:19 should not acquire many horses for himself.”
00:02:23 Verse 17: “Neither should he take many wives for himself,
00:02:27 “so that his heart may not go astray;
00:02:29 nor should he acquire vast amounts of silver and gold for himself.”
00:02:34 Do not acquire horses, wives,
00:02:37 vast amounts of silver and gold.
00:02:39 Solomon did all three.
00:02:41 You look at Deuteronomy 7:3, 4,
00:02:45 and there Jehovah says: ‘Do not form marriage alliances
00:02:48 with the nations because they will lead you astray.’
00:02:51 What did Solomon do?
00:02:53 Well, look over in 1 Kings chapter 11,
00:02:55 and look at verses 1-3.
00:03:00 First Kings 11:1-3—it says:
00:03:02 “But King Solomon loved many foreign women
00:03:05 “besides the daughter of Pharaoh:
00:03:07 “Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women.
00:03:11 “They were from the nations about whom Jehovah said to the Israelites:
00:03:15 “‘You must not go in among them,
00:03:17 “‘and they should not come in among you,
00:03:20 “‘for they will surely incline your heart to follow their gods.’
00:03:23 “But Solomon clung to them and loved them.
00:03:27 “And he had 700 wives who were princesses
00:03:30 “and 300 concubines,
00:03:32 and his wives gradually inclined his heart” —just as Jehovah said.
00:03:37 Now, how did this happen?
00:03:39 Solomon did not just fall into sin.
00:03:42 Solomon just didn’t, in a moment of weakness—
00:03:44 He didn’t just wake up one day and realize, “Oh my word,
00:03:46 I have 700 wives and 300 concubines!”
00:03:48 If he did, Solomon had more problems than we thought he did.
00:03:52 No, Solomon was an intelligent man.
00:03:54 This was a man who was blessed by Jehovah with wisdom.
00:03:57 How did he deviate so far?
00:04:00 Well, it was a series of decisions —one after another—
00:04:04 that differed from Jehovah’s directives
00:04:07 that somehow he was able to explain away,
00:04:10 rationalize away, until he was completely alienated from Jehovah.
00:04:15 Now, we don’t know
00:04:17 what was going through Solomon’s mind or how he made those decisions,
00:04:21 but even from our limited perspective,
00:04:23 we can see how that could have happened.
00:04:25 For example, he starts off talking about the daughter of Pharaoh.
00:04:29 Now, he took the daughter of Pharaoh as a wife.
00:04:31 But, interestingly, in 1 Kings chapter 3,
00:04:33 it relates how Jehovah granted him all the wisdom and blessed him.
00:04:37 Well, that was after he had taken the daughter of Pharaoh as a wife.
00:04:42 So is it possible that Solomon thought,
00:04:44 ‘Well, you know, Jehovah still blessed me; this must mean everything is OK’?
00:04:47 Now, Solomon knew something wasn’t quite right there
00:04:50 because at 2 Chronicles 8:11,
00:04:52 it says he had to build another house for her.
00:04:54 She couldn’t live in the house of David because of the Ark.
00:04:57 It was holy.
00:04:58 She was a foreigner and couldn’t live there.
00:05:01 He knew something wasn’t quite right.
00:05:03 But he was able to make the decision and rationalize it away anyway.
00:05:08 It says that he loved the Moabite women.
00:05:11 Now, as we know, the Moabites were enemies of Jehovah, but not all of them.
00:05:15 For example, you may remember that when David
00:05:19 was on the run from King Saul,
00:05:21 he asked the king of Moab
00:05:23 if he could bring his father and mother
00:05:26 —David’s father and mother— there, and the king of Moab protected them.
00:05:29 And he did so the whole time that David was in the stronghold, the account says.
00:05:33 So that means the king of Moab
00:05:36 protected Solomon’s grandparents.
00:05:39 We also remember Ruth.
00:05:41 Well, Ruth was Solomon’s great-great-grandmother,
00:05:44 and she was a Moabite woman, and look how well that turned out.
00:05:48 And also men from Moab and Ammon
00:05:51 were part of David’s mighty men.
00:05:54 So they weren’t all bad.
00:05:56 So was it perhaps through David’s mighty men
00:05:59 or maybe from his grandparents, who stayed in Moab,
00:06:02 that he was introduced to some of his first wives from Moab?
00:06:05 It talks about Ammonite women.
00:06:08 Well, we remember Solomon’s son Rehoboam, who later became king.
00:06:12 He was born from an Ammonite woman.
00:06:15 And, interestingly, he was born before Solomon became king.
00:06:20 So, again, is it possible
00:06:21 that Solomon reasoned: ‘Well, Jehovah is blessing me.
00:06:24 ‘I’ve got an Egyptian wife and an Ammonite wife.
00:06:26 Maybe this doesn’t apply to me like it does to everybody else.’
00:06:30 What about Sidonians?
00:06:32 Well, we know the Sidonians were famous for their craftsmanship.
00:06:35 They had outstanding abilities as loggers and lumbermen.
00:06:38 In fact, Solomon’s father, David,
00:06:41 used the Sidonians to bring lumber
00:06:44 in great quantity for the temple.
00:06:46 Solomon later established contracts
00:06:49 with the Sidonians to cut trees for the temple.
00:06:52 Well, was it through, possibly, some of these business relationships
00:06:56 that he first was introduced to some who became his wives?
00:06:59 Could he have reasoned: ‘Well, you know, marrying these Sidonian women—
00:07:03 ‘Well, that will help ensure that Jehovah’s house is completed.
00:07:06 This will help me fulfill my theocratic assignment.’
00:07:10 And just one more: What about the Hittite women?
00:07:14 Well, we remember Uriah.
00:07:16 David committed adultery with Bath-sheba
00:07:19 and had Uriah put to death.
00:07:22 Bath-sheba became Solomon’s mother.
00:07:25 Uriah was a Hittite and one of David’s mighty men.
00:07:30 So that means Solomon’s mother
00:07:33 had been married to a Hittite man.
00:07:35 So is it perhaps through Bath-sheba, through her former in-laws,
00:07:40 or perhaps through others that Solomon was introduced
00:07:43 to some of his first wives from the Hittites?
00:07:45 Now, we don’t know what Solomon was thinking,
00:07:49 but we can see how it was possible for him
00:07:52 to begin to rationalize some of those early decisions
00:07:56 until he found himself on a slippery slope,
00:07:59 completely alienated from Jehovah.
00:08:02 So, what’s the lesson for us?
00:08:04 Well, we read this account of Solomon
00:08:07 —accumulating all of those wives, all of the riches, all of those horses—
00:08:11 and it’s like watching a car crash in slow motion.
00:08:14 We know exactly where it’s heading, but Solomon didn’t see it coming.
00:08:19 So the question we have to ask ourselves is,
00:08:21 ‘What would the reaction be
00:08:23 ‘if somebody was reading my life story right now
00:08:27 —the decisions that I am making day to day right now?’
00:08:32 You see, our heart, too, is treacherous.
00:08:35 Our heart will try to cause us
00:08:38 to rationalize away Jehovah’s clear directives.
00:08:41 Sometimes we may rationalize a decision
00:08:44 because we see we’re still getting blessings from Jehovah,
00:08:47 or maybe we rationalize a decision because we see
00:08:50 how it worked out for somebody else
00:08:52 or what somebody else is doing—dangerous.
00:08:56 So, what do we need to do?
00:08:58 Well, we need to do what Solomon said and should have done himself.
00:09:01 If you turn to Proverbs 3:5,
00:09:05 let’s turn there together, Proverbs 3:5.
00:09:15 It says: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,
00:09:19 and do not rely on your own understanding.”
00:09:23 “Do not rely on your own understanding” —on our own wisdom.
00:09:27 “Trust in Jehovah”; follow his direction.
00:09:30 And if we do, we can be assured that we will never abandon
00:09:34 “the source of living water,”
00:09:36 but rather, we’ll benefit from his guidance for all eternity.

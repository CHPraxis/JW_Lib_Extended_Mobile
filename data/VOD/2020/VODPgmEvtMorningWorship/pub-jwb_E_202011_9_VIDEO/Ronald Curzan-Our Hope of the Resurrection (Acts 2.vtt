00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:02.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We would like to begin

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:04.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by posing three questions

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.856 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then answering those three questions.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, what do we know

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the resurrection?

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.530 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Second, what don’t we know

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the resurrection?

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:17.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, what should we do

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what we know about the resurrection?

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:24.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first, let’s go
to that first question posed:

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we know about the resurrection

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will soon take place here on earth?

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all, we know it’s a guarantee.

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a promise that will be fulfilled.

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on today’s text

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Acts 24:15, it says:

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:43.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is going to be a resurrection

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both the righteous
[as well as] the unrighteous.”

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:52.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just imagine
what it will be like when that begins,

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when over 6,000 years of deaths are undone

00:00:56.072 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those who are sleeping
in the graves will come back to life.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing prospect!

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as was pointed out,

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first line in our <i>Watchtower</i>  comments

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was pretty awesome,
and I’m sure you saw that too,

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants people to live, not die.

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:19.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is really
a manifestation of Jehovah’s power

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as his unfailing love
for all mankind.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus reflected his Father’s love.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he died in our behalf,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted to fulfill
the promise he made

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 5:28, 29,

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he said:
“All those in the memorial tombs

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:45.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will hear his voice and come out.”

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:47.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All” meaning

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:51.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the righteous and the unrighteous.”

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:54.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who are asleep will awaken.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:58.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have been long forgotten by humans,

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah has never forgotten them.

00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:04.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are right in his memory.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, have you ever gone to an old cemetery

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and looked at some of the gravestones?

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the engraving
has been worn off over years of weathering.

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t even know who’s buried

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that burial plot, but Jehovah does.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:25.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has it filed away
in his everlasting memory.

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we’re talking
about the righteous that will come back,

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are we talking about?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the righteous
are the faithful men and women

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have died
before Jesus’ sacrificial death

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:42.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other sheep
who die during the last days.

00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the unrighteous?

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the unrighteous are humans,
billions of humans,

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who died without really having an opportunity

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know Jehovah, to get to worship him

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even to apply Bible truths.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:02.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will have the opportunity
to get to know Jehovah,

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw close to him, and to do his will.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The March 2016 meeting workbook

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:14.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you may recall this)
had this scenario.

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Instead of funerals,

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there may be welcoming sessions
for the resurrected.”

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:22.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s going to be so amazing
for us to actually be there

00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:30.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience
these welcoming-type of meetings.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it posed two questions
in that meeting workbook:

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Which of your friends and relatives

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you especially
look forward to seeing again?”

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are probably some people

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going through your mind right now,
like I am thinking about.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second question:

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Which Bible characters do you
especially want to meet and talk to?”

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, a whole list
is probably coming into our minds.

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, stay tuned.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s a question:

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What indication do we have as to the manner

00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:03.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which the resurrected ones
will take their place?

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:05.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will they come back?

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:09.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, based on 1 Corinthians 15:23,

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that the heavenly resurrection

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the anointed is done in an orderly way.

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:20.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul said:
“Each one in his own proper order:

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:22.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ the firstfruits,

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
afterward those who belong
to the Christ during his presence.”

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:30.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it will be progressive during that time.

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since we know
that Jehovah is a God of order,

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s reasonable to conclude
that the earthly resurrection

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:41.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will take place in a logical and orderly way.

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of having billions
come back to life all at once,

00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that it would make much more sense
that it would be done progressively.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as each one is resurrected
—they come to life—

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:55.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can help them individually

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:59.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their needs and their circumstances.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we know
about the physical and spiritual care

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:06.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resurrected ones will receive at that time?

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:08.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at the right time,

00:05:08.157 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jehovah’s perfect timing,
he will awaken them.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what will they find?

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:17.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will find abundant housing, clothing,

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and food all given to them.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By whom?

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:25.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By those who will make it
through this system and on into the next

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:28.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—great tribulation survivors,

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and me.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have a precedent for that.

00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:36.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember when Jesus
resurrected a little girl?

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all those who saw that amazing miracle

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:42.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what did he say to those who saw that?

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:45.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: ‘Please give
the little girl something to eat.’

00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he didn’t say that
every time he resurrected someone,

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he knew her individual needs,
and he addressed those.

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likewise, we will have
that privilege in this coming system.

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:01.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us will have that privilege.

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about all the training

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have received here at Bethel and LDC

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:08.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other areas of our organization

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be put to use at that time.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about the billions
of “unrighteous ones”

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be resurrected
that will need to have spiritual instruction.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will need to learn about Jehovah;

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will need to learn
about Jesus and the ransom sacrifice

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:30.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they can exercise
that faith in the ransom.

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:32.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will teach them?

00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:36.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will teach them,
and hopefully I will teach them.

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:40.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what will we use as a basis

00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:42.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach these ones who need to learn

00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah, Jesus,
and Jehovah’s requirements?

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the Bible
will be something that we will use.

00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But John’s vision at Revelation 20:12
gives us another clue.

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there and read this together,

00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:01.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 20:12;

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:06.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I saw the dead,
the great and the small,

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“standing before the throne,
and scrolls were opened.

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:14.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But another scroll was opened;
it is the scroll of life.

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dead were judged out of those things

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
written in the scrolls
according to their deeds.”

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, was this mentioning the “deeds”

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their past conduct, or past deeds?

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:30.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:34.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This judgment will not focus
on what they did before they died.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:36.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do we know that?

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:41.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 6:7, as you recall, says:

00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the one who has died has been acquitted

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:47.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or the footnote says:
“released (pardoned)”]

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his sin.”

00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those who come back to life,

00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who are resurrected,
will have a clean slate.

00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a relief for them and for us,

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:01.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because many of us do know many

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who did not worship Jehovah
before they passed away!

00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:09.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that clean slate is such a relief.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:13.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to live forever there
will be further requirements

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who survive the great tribulation

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as those who are resurrected.

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to learn
and continue to obey those requirements

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:26.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and any new ones
that might be revealed by Jehovah

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the thousand years.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what don’t we know
about the resurrection?

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot.

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many questions
that we might have:

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:41.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will those who died recently be raised

00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:44.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
near the start
of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign?

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the righteous be brought back first
and then the unrighteous?

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they be welcomed
by loved ones who know them?

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:56.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will resurrections take place
in the area where people died?

00:08:56.252 --> 00:08:58.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will Jehovah arrange matters

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:00.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who were married when they died?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will faithful men of old
with leadership abilities

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come back to help to organize matters?

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:11.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how will theocratic
spiritual food be given?

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be a Teaching Committee
or Writing Committee,

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:17.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or will another arrangement
be made to provide spiritual food?

00:09:17.573 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be hard copies?

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:21.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be electronic copies?
Will there be videos?

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be some sort of JW broadcast?

00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:26.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just don’t know.

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:30.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to stay tuned,
and we need to be patient.

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good to heed Jeremiah’s advice.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn to Lamentations chapter 3,

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice there in Lamentations 3:25, 26

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:44.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that we want
to focus on today in the meantime.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Good is Jehovah
to the one hoping in him,

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:52.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the person who keeps seeking him.

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Good it is to wait in silence
[or the footnote says: “to wait patiently”]

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the salvation of Jehovah.”

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:03.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know that in due course,

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all will be revealed by Jehovah.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we rest our hope on Jehovah

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those in the future come back,

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:15.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will know that the one who will
“satisfy the desire of every living thing”

00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have it all taken care for us.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the answers will be given to us.

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:24.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always given us
what we need to be faithful now,

00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’ll do the same in the future.

00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now it’s up to each and every one of us

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:31.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prove our faithfulness,

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put our hope in that resurrection hope,
and to share it with others.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:39.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And hopefully some day,
maybe a thousand years from now,

00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll look back, and we’ll say:

00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:43.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There [<i>was</i> ] a resurrection

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:47.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”

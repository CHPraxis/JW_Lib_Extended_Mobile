00:00:01 Our text comments contain this thought
00:00:03 (if you look about halfway down,
00:00:05 there’s a sentence that says):
00:00:06 “Feeling tender compassion
00:00:09 will move us to acts of kindness.”
00:00:12 It’s interesting that the Bible
00:00:13 in different places
00:00:14 links those two qualities together.
00:00:16 For example, Ephesians 4:32 states:
00:00:18 “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate.”
00:00:24 Insight on the Scriptures  defines compassion this way:
00:00:27 “A sympathetic awareness of another’s suffering or adversity
00:00:32 coupled with a desire to alleviate it.”
00:00:35 So we have the awareness —we have the feeling—
00:00:38 along with that desire to act kindly.
00:00:42 But sadly, as The Watchtower  once mentioned:
00:00:46 “The moral climate of our time . . .
00:00:48 has killed compassion in the hearts of so many.”
00:00:53 A “Watching the World” item highlighted that some years ago in the Awake!
00:00:57 In Italy, a six-year-old girl and her father were driving to the beach.
00:01:02 As they entered a tunnel, the father,
00:01:05 who was only in his 30’s, suddenly suffered a heart attack.
00:01:09 Before he died, he told his little girl to find her way home.
00:01:14 She struggled out of the tunnel,
00:01:16 repeatedly blown over by gusts of wind
00:01:19 from cars that zipped by without slowing.
00:01:22 Scratched, bleeding, and in tears,
00:01:25 she walked along the highway for half an hour,
00:01:29 ignored by hundreds of passing cars filled with vacationers
00:01:33 until finally one car stopped to help.
00:01:36 Newspaper editorials around the country asked searching questions,
00:01:40 such as whether the country’s affluence had made it lose
00:01:43 some of the warmth and compassion
00:01:46 for which it had long been famous.
00:01:48 One newspaper mentioned:
00:01:50 “Along the happy road of vacation,
00:01:53 “there were no scheduled stops
00:01:55 for attending to the pain of others.”
00:01:58 Well, that account sadly illustrates the world that we live in.
00:02:03 Let’s talk a little bit more about this quality of compassion.
00:02:07 We’ll consider when compassion should not be shown,
00:02:10 we’ll look at an example of Jehovah’s compassion,
00:02:13 and then we’ll consider some practical ways
00:02:16 that we can show compassion.
00:02:19 First, there are times when compassion should not be shown.
00:02:23 For example, if someone deliberately persists in sin,
00:02:26 it would be wrong to feel that we
00:02:28 should compassionately shield them from discipline.
00:02:32 See, that would be misplaced compassion.
00:02:35 Let’s notice an example in ancient Israel.
00:02:37 Please turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 13 —Deuteronomy 13.
00:02:42 If you look at verse 6,
00:02:44 the Israelites were commanded that if a brother, child,
00:02:48 and you’ll notice there some expressions such as “cherished wife”
00:02:52 or “closest companion,”
00:02:54 if any of those were to urge a person to “serve other gods,”
00:02:58 notice the instruction in verse 8:
00:03:00 “You must not give in to him or listen to him, nor should you show pity
00:03:04 “or feel compassion or protect him;
00:03:09 instead, you should kill him without fail.”
00:03:13 Now, why was that so important?
00:03:15 Why was it important not to show compassion?
00:03:17 Well, verse 11: “Then all Israel will hear and become afraid,
00:03:22 “and they will never again
00:03:24 do anything bad like this among you.”
00:03:28 So it was for a protection for the nation.
00:03:30 If someone tried to turn an Israelite from serving Jehovah,
00:03:33 that was not the time to show compassion.
00:03:36 Yielding to pressure to show compassion when it’s contrary to God’s will
00:03:41 can have serious consequences.
00:03:43 So we certainly need to avoid misplaced compassion.
00:03:49 Now let’s consider an example of Jehovah’s compassion.
00:03:52 Turn with me to Exodus chapter 3 —Exodus chapter 3.
00:03:57 While tending to his father-in-law’s sheep,
00:03:59 Moses saw something he’d never seen before.
00:04:02 And I daresay none of us have ever seen it either.
00:04:04 Moses saw a thornbush on fire,
00:04:07 but it wasn’t being consumed.
00:04:10 So Moses decided to go and investigate.
00:04:12 By means of an angel, Jehovah spoke to Moses from the midst of the fire.
00:04:16 And notice what he said in verse 5:
00:04:19 “Do not come any nearer.
00:04:21 “Remove your sandals from your feet,
00:04:23 because the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
00:04:28 So just think: Because the holy God was present representatively,
00:04:33 the ground itself became holy.
00:04:36 Now, keep that thought in mind; we’re going to come back to it.
00:04:39 Let’s focus now on Jehovah’s compassion for his people who were suffering in Egypt.
00:04:43 Notice verse 7: “Jehovah added:
00:04:46 “‘I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt,
00:04:50 “‘and I have heard their outcry because of those who force them to work;
00:04:55 I well know the pains they suffer.’”
00:04:59 So Jehovah wasn’t blind to the misery of his people.
00:05:02 He wasn’t deaf to their cries for help.
00:05:05 Their anguish became his own.
00:05:08 Did you notice the expression at the end of the verse?
00:05:10 “I well know the pains they suffer.”
00:05:14 Regarding the phrase “I well know,” one reference work states:
00:05:17 “The expression implies personal feeling,
00:05:20 tenderness, and compassion.”
00:05:24 So Jehovah’s words here reveal a deeply concerned,
00:05:27 caring, and compassionate God.
00:05:30 And what would Jehovah do?
00:05:31 Would he act kindly on that compassion?
00:05:34 Well, we know he was going to.
00:05:36 In verse 10, in part, Jehovah commissioned Moses:
00:05:39 “Bring my people . . . out of Egypt.”
00:05:43 You know, this account should be encouraging to us.
00:05:46 We can be sure that Jehovah sees our adversities.
00:05:49 He hears our cries for help.
00:05:51 He knows the pain that we suffer at times.
00:05:55 But Jehovah just doesn’t feel  compassion for us.
00:05:58 No, he’s moved to act kindly.
00:06:00 Why?
00:06:02 First Peter 5:7 —he cares for each one of us.
00:06:06 God’s compassion also gives us reason for hope.
00:06:09 One sister who struggled with depression and discouragement
00:06:13 found comfort in this account about Moses and the thornbush.
00:06:16 Remember the holy ground that we read about in verse 5.
00:06:19 The sister said:
00:06:21 “If Jehovah can make even the dirt holy,
00:06:24 then maybe there is a little hope for me.”
00:06:28 See, she’d benefited from Jehovah’s compassion.
00:06:31 Well, so far we’ve seen the need to avoid misplaced compassion.
00:06:35 We’ve considered Jehovah’s example of not only feeling  compassion
00:06:39 but acting  kindly on it.
00:06:41 How can we imitate him?
00:06:43 One quality that can help is love
00:06:46 —unselfish love— of neighbor.
00:06:48 Let’s consider two practical ways that can help us
00:06:52 —that we can show this type of compassion.
00:06:54 First, compassion will help us to avoid
00:06:57 reacting harshly when others make mistakes.
00:07:01 Remember that earlier we quoted Ephesians 4:32,
00:07:04 linking kindness and compassion.
00:07:06 Well, let’s turn to the verse just previous to it
00:07:08 —Ephesians 4 and let’s read verse 31— Ephesians 4:31.
00:07:13 Keep that thought in mind: Compassion will help us
00:07:16 to avoid reacting harshly when others make mistakes.
00:07:19 Verse 31: “Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness,
00:07:24 “anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech,
00:07:28 as well as everything injurious.”
00:07:30 And then verse 32 says: “But [there’s the connector, but]
00:07:35 “become kind to one another,
00:07:38 tenderly compassionate.”
00:07:41 So whether at home, in the congregation,
00:07:43 at Bethel, on construction sites —wherever we may be—
00:07:46 let’s allow love, this unselfish love of neighbor,
00:07:50 to cause us to show compassion
00:07:52 and avoid reacting harshly when others make mistakes.
00:07:57 A second way that love can help us to be compassionate
00:08:00 is that it will help us to avoid the imperfect tendency
00:08:03 to abuse power.
00:08:05 Colossians 3:12 states:
00:08:07 “Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness.”
00:08:12 There are the two linked together again,
00:08:14 and then the verse adds “humility [or “lowliness of mind,” ftn.].”
00:08:18 The Watchtower  once made this point about that verse:
00:08:22 “Lowliness of mind enables us to put ourselves
00:08:25 “in the position of those under our supervision.
00:08:29 “To be compassionate involves being humble and reasonable
00:08:34 “rather than hard to please.
00:08:36 “Efficiency should not be an excuse
00:08:39 for treating people as mere parts of a machine”
00:08:42 —good points to keep in mind.
00:08:45 So those are two ways that love can help us to be compassionate:
00:08:49 Avoid reacting harshly when others make mistakes,
00:08:52 and avoid the imperfect tendency to abuse power.
00:08:56 So while the moral climate has killed compassion
00:09:00 in the hearts of so many today,
00:09:02 we want to be known for our compassion.
00:09:05 Of course, never would we want to display misplaced compassion
00:09:09 if someone deliberately persists in sin.
00:09:12 Rather, we want to imitate Jehovah
00:09:14 and kindly act on our feelings of compassion for those in need.
00:09:19 So as we go about our day, let’s look for ways
00:09:22 that we can heed the admonition there at Ephesians 4:32:
00:09:25 “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate.”

00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:04.454 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The cities of refuge

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—that was a merciful provision of God.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But we might link it to something

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:13.363 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that could involve all of us,

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:17.233 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and that is the common expression

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Forgive and forget.”

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ve heard it,
and maybe you have tried to apply it.

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:28.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe at the outset,
ask yourself,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Were the cities of refuge

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a provision to forgive and forget?’

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:39.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you were there
and some men were chopping a tree

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:41.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ax head flew off

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bonked your uncle,
killing him,

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:47.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think you’d be in position to say:

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, well, it was an accident.
You didn’t mean it.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You feel sorry, so why don’t we
just forgive and forget?”

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:56.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that wasn’t possible

00:00:56.806 --> 00:01:00.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the sanctity of life and blood

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were involved in that case.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do they suggest (the cities of refuge)

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God, though merciful,

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:14.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not forgive or forget?

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you open
to the fourth chapter of Ephesians,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:23.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is a verse there
that makes it clear what the answer is.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is, Ephesians 4:32:

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:32.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But become kind to one another,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“tenderly compassionate,
freely forgiving one another

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as God also by Christ

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
freely forgave you.”

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:45.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, certainly, we wouldn’t disagree

00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God is able to forgive.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As to forgetting,
in Jeremiah chapter 31,

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:56.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the comment
(with regard to the new covenant) said:

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:59.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will forgive their error,

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will no longer remember their sin.”

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:10.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So does God forgive and forget?

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:14.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the account of David.

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know of his grievous sin.

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, afterward,

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:23.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God said to Solomon (with regard to David)

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘David walked,
with integrity of heart with uprightness,

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing according to all that I commanded.’

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:37.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, clearly, God had forgiven David.

00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:40.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how about forgetting?

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:44.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did God forget David’s sins?

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know about them
because they’re recorded in the Bible.

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:52.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t forget them, and certainly
by God recording them in the Bible,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it shows that he doesn’t forget them
in the strictest sense of the word.

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with regard to David’s serious sins,

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God was able to forget
in the sense of putting behind Him

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:11.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s sins and not remembering them

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the sense of calling them back

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:18.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to punish David time and time again.

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He—that is, God—
put David’s sins behind Him.

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about us and the encouragement

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to forgive and forget?

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that there are times,
as mentioned earlier today,

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when individuals may rub us the wrong way

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or say something hurtful about us;

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe it’s like a stab of a sword.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may do something thoughtless;

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may even betray a confidence

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:52.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hurt us in that way.

00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:56.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s our reaction going to be?
get angry?

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
say something harsh in return?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:03.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe simply avoid
the brother or sister thereafter?

00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:07.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we mentioned Ephesians 4:32,

00:04:07.897 --> 00:04:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
read it, and it said:

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Freely forgiving one another

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as God

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:19.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also by Christ freely forgave you.”

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:24.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, clearly, if we want to imitate God,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then that involves being willing to forgive,

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that means

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting the individual’s trespasses

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind us.

00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:42.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Realistically, though,
how can we go about that?

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:47.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might think of some physical wounds
to illustrate the point.

00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some wounds are small and light

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others more serious or deeper,

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they don’t all require the same reaction.

00:04:56.913 --> 00:05:01.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s just imagine
that we had an envelope

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:05.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we used our finger to open the envelope,

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the process we got a paper cut.

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ow!
Wow, that hurt!”

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wished we had used a letter opener.

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t.
We used our finger, and it really hurt.

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t it true that if you’ve done that,

00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:23.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a day or two later

00:05:23.373 --> 00:05:26.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can’t even remember where the wound is?

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:31.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, you cut yourself,
but you’ve forgotten it.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some wounds, of course,
are more serious or deeper.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just say that you needed

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an emergency appendectomy,

00:05:41.524 --> 00:05:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it wasn’t going to be done
laparoscopically

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with three small holes

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather with an open incision.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after that, would it be rational

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stick your finger through the incision

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kind of poke around inside
where the appendix had been?

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would poking around in the wound help things?

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, rather, do we let it go
—forget about it?

00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be hurtful to walk for a few days,

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:18.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in time, it’s behind you.

00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:21.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in fact, now,
if you’ve had an appendectomy,

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you probably don’t think about it,

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe it’s been years
since you thought about it.

00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:29.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, granted, there may be
a small scar on your abdomen,

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:34.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s been put behind you.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can that same concept be applied

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to unkind things that have been said about us

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:46.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by someone who hurt us,
perhaps betrayed a trust?

00:06:46.956 --> 00:06:49.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what?

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:52.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians chapter 3,

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might read the whole verse,

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:57.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 13:

00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Continue putting up with one another

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and forgiving one another freely

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even if anyone <i>has</i>

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:10.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a cause for complaint against another.

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:14.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you must also do the same.”

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:21.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we want to imitate Jehovah, do we not?

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:25.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if God freely forgives,

00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:29.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that not an incentive for us
to try to do the same?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, granted, that doesn’t mean

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:37.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has forgotten
the trespass against us.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we?
Maybe, maybe not.

00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:45.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do recall what Jesus said
in the model prayer, however,

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he said that ‘as we forgive
the trespasses of others

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so God will accordingly
forgive our trespasses.’

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Conversely, if we are disinclined

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to forgive the trespasses of others,

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:07.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can we expect of God for us?

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:10.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what is the essence,

00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:12.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applied personally,

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:17.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this encouragement to forgive and forget?

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means to forgive

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the sense of letting go,

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not holding on to the anger,

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not feeling constant resentment thereafter,

00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:32.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or not even gossiping

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what was done that hurt us.

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:39.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it really is quite immaterial.

00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:42.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s simply like a paper cut:

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a couple of days, we don’t
even remember where the wound is.

Can we do that with regard to the offense,

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:53.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the hurt, personally?

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even with something more serious

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an offense that seems deeper—

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can we be like Jehovah

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:06.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by forgetting in the sense of putting
it behind us?

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah didn’t thereafter

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
punish David time and time again,

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:18.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can we put the fellow servant’s error,

00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:20.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offense,

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:24.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps a lack of trust—

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we put those things behind us

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just realizing that he or she
is still our brother?

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s an imperfect brother
just as we’re imperfect,

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:39.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but put it behind and forgive the trespass

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:44.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Jehovah forgives our trespasses.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
None of us like being told lies,

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:05.221 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but we are constantly bombarded

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with false stories.

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:10.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
If we are not careful, they could harm us.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:11.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, we are going, therefore,

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.363 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to develop the theme

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:16.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Protect Yourself From Lies.”

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will answer three questions:

00:00:18.702 --> 00:00:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lies must we protect ourselves from?

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are those lies dangerous?

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can we protect ourselves from lies?

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us start with the first question:

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lies must we protect ourselves from?

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lies we want to talk about today

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are often called false news, fake news,

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misinformation, or false information.

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:46.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we are experiencing
an avalanche of misinformation.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, there is
so much misinformation out there

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:56.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These lies deal with the origin of the virus,

00:00:56.506 --> 00:00:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unproven prevention, and cures.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They include responses by governments,

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
companies, celebrities, and others.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, common to misinformation

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is their sensational nature.

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:15.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are created to be widely shared
in order to generate revenue.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:19.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or they are promoting or discrediting
a public figure,

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a political movement, a company, etcetera.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we often find false,
or fake, news in social media,

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also find it
in the established news media.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many countries, people know exactly
what newspaper or TV station

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distorts the truth
in one or the other direction.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, misinformation of this kind

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been in existence throughout history.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at one example
that we find in 2 Kings chapter 18.

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:57.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, King Hezekiah

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was confronted with propaganda
by Assyrian messengers.

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:06.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were the elements
of their misinformation?

00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at the first element
that we find at 2 Kings 18:21.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we find an outright lie.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read: “Look!

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You trust in the support
of this crushed reed, Egypt,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which if a man should lean on it
would enter into his palm and pierce it.”

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:30.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a lie, for Hezekiah
had not made an alliance with Egypt.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at element number two.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:37.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find it in verses 22 and 25.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After stating that Hezekiah had removed

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s high places and altars in verse 22,

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:47.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is what we read in verse 25:

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now is it without authorization from Jehovah

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I have come up against this place
to destroy it?

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah himself said to me,

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:59.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So element number two is cunning reasoning.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find bits of truthful information

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were suddenly diffused with lies.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The message was that Jehovah
would not act in behalf of his people

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:15.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was displeased with them.

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:18.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, the opposite was true.

00:03:18.047 --> 00:03:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was very happy with his people

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had returned to true worship.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is element number three?

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:28.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find it in verse 31.

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:31.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we see lies that are presented

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way of an easy solution,
with tempting rewards.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read in verse 31
(in the middle, starting there):

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make peace with me and surrender,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and each [one] of you
will eat from his own vine

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and from his own fig tree

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will drink the water of his own cistern.”

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Surrender” was presented as an easy solution

00:03:57.553 --> 00:03:59.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection with empty rewards.

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:04.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prospect of eating fresh bread
and drinking new wine

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:07.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have been tempting to those in lockdown.

00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, did the Assyrians ever

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
treat their enemies kindly?

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, never.

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our second question:

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:23.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are those lies dangerous?

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in Hezekiah’s day, the propaganda

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:29.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was supposed to lead the Jews
in making a bad decision

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:33.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a decision that could have cost their lives.

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, too, making a bad decision

00:04:36.492 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be the result
of trusting in false, or fake, news.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is dangerous.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this time of the pandemic,

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this can have an effect
on our health and our life.

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reacting to other propaganda
can create financial losses

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or can result in other negative consequences.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is even more at stake.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:05.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lies destroy trust.

00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They create doubts, and they can undermine
our lifesaving determination

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:17.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we are determined to respect
governments and their laws

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in harmony with Romans chapter 13.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the news often presents politics,

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
politicians, state institutions
in a bad light.

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, we are confronted
with outright lies,

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with cunning reasoning,

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with easy solutions with empty promises.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:38.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please let’s be on the watch.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can weaken our determination
to be faithful to Jehovah

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:46.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by obeying the superior authorities

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and displaying Christian neutrality.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example is

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misinformation about Jehovah’s organization
and the Governing Body.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:01.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have been accused
of promoting Communism,

00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while others claim that we promote

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ideals and interests
of American imperialism.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
have been called anarchists.

00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And nowadays, we are being called extremists,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the list can go on.

00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will be the next lie?

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:23.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, lies create doubts

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and destroy trust.

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of what we hear and read

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is based on misinformation campaigns
of apostates.

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:35.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may sound convincing, even to us,

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we now say:
“I will not believe it anyway.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just curious to know what it is.”

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:45.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exposing ourselves
to this kind of misinformation

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can create doubts

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and undermine our complete trust
in the Governing Body.

00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:52.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This makes us vulnerable.

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use his organization

00:06:56.632 --> 00:06:59.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to lead us through the great tribulation.

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:02.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is just no other way to succeed.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our third question:

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we protect ourselves
from those lies?

00:07:08.644 --> 00:07:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can protect ourselves from those lies

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by limiting our exposure to misinformation.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to look at the quality

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:22.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the quantity
of the information we take in.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The quality

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:29.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we want to pick
the most reliable source of information.

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quantity

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to stay up to date with world events,

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not need to update ourselves
every hour.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:39.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, let us set a personal time limit

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then stick to it.

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else can we do?

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 14:15 says:

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The naive person believes every word,

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the shrewd one ponders each step.”

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the key is to have a healthy skepticism

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while keeping an open mind.

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:04.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we read at Job 12:11:

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:08.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not the ear test out words

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the tongue tastes food?”

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:14.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So before reacting quickly
on something we hear or read,

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to “test out words.”

00:08:16.846 --> 00:08:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us look for solid confirmation.

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:22.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to compare
what we’ve read in the Bible

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:25.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we’ve learned from the Bible
and what Bible principles apply.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any guidance from the organization?

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it comes to news
about Jehovah’s organization,

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can expect more lies to be spread
as we get closer to Jehovah’s day.

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:42.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, therefore,
strengthen our trust today.

00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:46.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good guidance from Jehovah’s organization
during this pandemic

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just another proof

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:52.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is with the Governing Body.

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:57.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our theme was
“Protect Yourself From Lies.”

00:08:57.253 --> 00:09:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discussed the danger of misinformation
in its different forms:

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outright lies, cunning reasoning,
and empty promises.

00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lies destroy trust.

00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, let us limit
our exposure to these lies

00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:16.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen our trust in Jehovah
and his organization today.

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:18.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will prepare us

00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:22.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for one of the greatest lies
in the very near future:

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Peace and security!”

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, this will be fake news

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many (most people) will believe in it.

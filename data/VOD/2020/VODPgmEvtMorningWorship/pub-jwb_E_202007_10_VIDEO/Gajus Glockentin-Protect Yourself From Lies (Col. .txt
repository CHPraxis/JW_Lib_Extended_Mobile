00:00:01 None of us like being told lies,
00:00:03 but we are constantly bombarded
00:00:05 with false stories.
00:00:07 If we are not careful, they could harm us.
00:00:10 Today, we are going, therefore,
00:00:11 to develop the theme
00:00:13 “Protect Yourself From Lies.”
00:00:16 We will answer three questions:
00:00:18 What lies must we protect ourselves from?
00:00:21 Why are those lies dangerous?
00:00:24 And how can we protect ourselves from lies?
00:00:28 Let us start with the first question:
00:00:30 What lies must we protect ourselves from?
00:00:33 The lies we want to talk about today
00:00:35 are often called false news, fake news,
00:00:39 misinformation, or false information.
00:00:42 Today, we are experiencing an avalanche of misinformation.
00:00:46 For example, there is so much misinformation out there
00:00:50 about the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:00:53 These lies deal with the origin of the virus,
00:00:56 unproven prevention, and cures.
00:00:59 They include responses by governments,
00:01:01 companies, celebrities, and others.
00:01:04 Now, common to misinformation
00:01:08 is their sensational nature.
00:01:10 They are created to be widely shared in order to generate revenue.
00:01:15 Or they are promoting or discrediting a public figure,
00:01:19 a political movement, a company, etcetera.
00:01:23 Now, we often find false, or fake, news in social media,
00:01:28 but we also find it in the established news media.
00:01:32 In many countries, people know exactly what newspaper or TV station
00:01:37 distorts the truth in one or the other direction.
00:01:41 And yet, misinformation of this kind
00:01:45 has been in existence throughout history.
00:01:49 Let’s look at one example that we find in 2 Kings chapter 18.
00:01:54 At one point, King Hezekiah
00:01:57 was confronted with propaganda by Assyrian messengers.
00:02:01 What were the elements of their misinformation?
00:02:06 Let’s look at the first element that we find at 2 Kings 18:21.
00:02:11 Here we find an outright lie.
00:02:13 We read: “Look!
00:02:16 “You trust in the support of this crushed reed, Egypt,
00:02:20 which if a man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it.”
00:02:25 This was a lie, for Hezekiah had not made an alliance with Egypt.
00:02:31 Now let’s look at element number two.
00:02:34 We find it in verses 22 and 25.
00:02:37 After stating that Hezekiah had removed
00:02:39 Jehovah’s high places and altars in verse 22,
00:02:43 this is what we read in verse 25:
00:02:47 “Now is it without authorization from Jehovah
00:02:50 “that I have come up against this place to destroy it?
00:02:53 “Jehovah himself said to me,
00:02:55 ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’”
00:02:59 So element number two is cunning reasoning.
00:03:03 We find bits of truthful information
00:03:06 that were suddenly diffused with lies.
00:03:09 The message was that Jehovah would not act in behalf of his people
00:03:13 because he was displeased with them.
00:03:15 Yet, the opposite was true.
00:03:18 Jehovah was very happy with his people
00:03:20 because they had returned to true worship.
00:03:24 Now, what is element number three?
00:03:26 We find it in verse 31.
00:03:28 Here we see lies that are presented
00:03:31 in a way of an easy solution, with tempting rewards.
00:03:35 We read in verse 31 (in the middle, starting there):
00:03:40 “Make peace with me and surrender,
00:03:44 “and each [one] of you will eat from his own vine
00:03:47 “and from his own fig tree
00:03:49 and will drink the water of his own cistern.”
00:03:53 “Surrender” was presented as an easy solution
00:03:57 in connection with empty rewards.
00:03:59 The prospect of eating fresh bread and drinking new wine
00:04:04 must have been tempting to those in lockdown.
00:04:07 However, did the Assyrians ever
00:04:11 treat their enemies kindly?
00:04:14 No, never.
00:04:18 That brings us to our second question:
00:04:21 Why are those lies dangerous?
00:04:23 Now, in Hezekiah’s day, the propaganda
00:04:26 was supposed to lead the Jews in making a bad decision
00:04:29 —a decision that could have cost their lives.
00:04:33 Today, too, making a bad decision
00:04:36 would be the result of trusting in false, or fake, news.
00:04:40 This is dangerous.
00:04:42 In this time of the pandemic,
00:04:45 this can have an effect on our health and our life.
00:04:49 Reacting to other propaganda can create financial losses
00:04:53 or can result in other negative consequences.
00:04:57 But there is even more at stake.
00:05:01 Lies destroy trust.
00:05:05 They create doubts, and they can undermine our lifesaving determination
00:05:10 to follow Jehovah’s direction.
00:05:12 For example, we are determined to respect governments and their laws
00:05:17 in harmony with Romans chapter 13.
00:05:19 Now, the news often presents politics,
00:05:23 politicians, state institutions in a bad light.
00:05:26 Sometimes, we are confronted with outright lies,
00:05:30 with cunning reasoning,
00:05:32 or with easy solutions with empty promises.
00:05:36 Please let’s be on the watch.
00:05:38 This can weaken our determination to be faithful to Jehovah
00:05:43 by obeying the superior authorities
00:05:46 and displaying Christian neutrality.
00:05:50 Another example is
00:05:52 misinformation about Jehovah’s organization and the Governing Body.
00:05:57 Jehovah’s Witnesses have been accused of promoting Communism,
00:06:01 while others claim that we promote
00:06:04 the ideals and interests of American imperialism.
00:06:07 Our brothers and sisters have been called anarchists.
00:06:11 And nowadays, we are being called extremists,
00:06:14 and the list can go on.
00:06:16 What will be the next lie?
00:06:19 Remember, lies create doubts
00:06:23 and destroy trust.
00:06:25 Some of what we hear and read
00:06:27 is based on misinformation campaigns of apostates.
00:06:31 It may sound convincing, even to us,
00:06:35 even if we now say: “I will not believe it anyway.
00:06:39 I’m just curious to know what it is.”
00:06:41 Exposing ourselves to this kind of misinformation
00:06:45 can create doubts
00:06:47 and undermine our complete trust in the Governing Body.
00:06:50 This makes us vulnerable.
00:06:52 Jehovah will use his organization
00:06:56 to lead us through the great tribulation.
00:06:59 There is just no other way to succeed.
00:07:02 That brings us to our third question:
00:07:05 How can we protect ourselves from those lies?
00:07:08 Now, we can protect ourselves from those lies
00:07:11 by limiting our exposure to misinformation.
00:07:14 Therefore, we need to look at the quality
00:07:18 and the quantity of the information we take in.
00:07:22 The quality
00:07:24 —we want to pick the most reliable source of information.
00:07:29 Quantity
00:07:31 —to stay up to date with world events,
00:07:33 we do not need to update ourselves every hour.
00:07:36 Therefore, let us set a personal time limit
00:07:39 and then stick to it.
00:07:42 What else can we do?
00:07:44 Proverbs 14:15 says:
00:07:46 “The naive person believes every word,
00:07:49 but the shrewd one ponders each step.”
00:07:53 So the key is to have a healthy skepticism
00:07:57 while keeping an open mind.
00:08:01 Or we read at Job 12:11:
00:08:04 “Does not the ear test out words
00:08:08 as the tongue tastes food?”
00:08:11 So before reacting quickly on something we hear or read,
00:08:14 we want to “test out words.”
00:08:16 Let us look for solid confirmation.
00:08:19 We want to compare what we’ve read in the Bible
00:08:22 and what we’ve learned from the Bible and what Bible principles apply.
00:08:25 Is there any guidance from the organization?
00:08:29 And when it comes to news about Jehovah’s organization,
00:08:33 we can expect more lies to be spread as we get closer to Jehovah’s day.
00:08:37 Let us, therefore, strengthen our trust today.
00:08:42 The good guidance from Jehovah’s organization during this pandemic
00:08:46 is just another proof
00:08:48 that Jehovah is with the Governing Body.
00:08:52 So our theme was “Protect Yourself From Lies.”
00:08:57 We discussed the danger of misinformation in its different forms:
00:09:00 outright lies, cunning reasoning, and empty promises.
00:09:04 Lies destroy trust.
00:09:08 Therefore, let us limit our exposure to these lies
00:09:12 and strengthen our trust in Jehovah and his organization today.
00:09:16 This will prepare us
00:09:18 for one of the greatest lies in the very near future:
00:09:22 “Peace and security!”
00:09:24 And remember, this will be fake news
00:09:27 and many (most people) will believe in it.

00:00:01 The scripture that we are highlighting today
00:00:02 is 1 Timothy 5:2,
00:00:04 which instructs Christian men
00:00:06 to treat “older women as mothers, . . .
00:00:08 “younger women as sisters,
00:00:10 with all chasteness.”
00:00:12 Of course, the reverse is also true:
00:00:14 Christian women should treat older men as fathers
00:00:17 and younger men as brothers, with all chasteness.
00:00:21 This is taken from the Watchtower  article entitled “We Can Remain Chaste,”
00:00:25 one portion of which discusses the matter
00:00:28 of flirting with the opposite sex.
00:00:31 My discussion is going to focus
00:00:33 on keeping one’s ego in check.
00:00:36 Now, what are the connections between chasteness,
00:00:39 flirting, and ego?
00:00:41 Well, let’s start with chasteness,
00:00:43 that is, purity in thought and action.
00:00:46 And it means “being free from all taint
00:00:49 of what is lewd or salacious,”
00:00:51 that is, what arouses or appeals
00:00:55 to sexual desire or imagination.
00:00:58 And one way to maintain our chastity
00:01:00 is to avoid the practice of flirting.
00:01:03 And what is that?
00:01:04 Well, flirting means ‘behaving amorously
00:01:07 without serious intent.’
00:01:10 Such a person signals romantic interest
00:01:13 with no intention of marriage.
00:01:15 It may involve an inappropriate remark, a look,
00:01:19 a touch, the tone of voice, a coy smile,
00:01:23 even the way one dresses, stands, or carries oneself.
00:01:28 Some single people flirt with each other
00:01:32 or with married folks.
00:01:34 Some married people flirt with single people or with other married people.
00:01:38 And in this degenerate world,
00:01:41 men flirt with men, and women flirt with women.
00:01:44 But it’s inappropriate for single people to send romantic signals
00:01:48 to each other just for amusement,
00:01:50 and it is morally wrong for married people
00:01:53 to direct that kind of attention to a person outside of their marriage.
00:01:57 Interestingly, an attorney who practices family law reported:
00:02:02 “I talk to plenty of people who are going through divorce.
00:02:05 “In most cases, these marriages are ending
00:02:09 “because someone had an affair, and in all of those cases,
00:02:13 the affair started out as just a little harmless flirting.”
00:02:18 Of course, flirting is not harmless.
00:02:20 To intentionally toy with the feelings of others is cruel.
00:02:25 It can arouse wrong desires and expectations
00:02:28 that may result in a lot of emotional pain.
00:02:31 It can also lead to worse things: fornication or adultery.
00:02:35 It’s no wonder that it has been said
00:02:37 that flirts make poor friends and worse marriage mates.
00:02:41 Well, in the world, flirting is viewed as a sport,
00:02:44 and it’s done to increase one’s own self-esteem.
00:02:48 Now, that’s where ego comes into the picture.
00:02:51 Ego is “the sense of one’s own worth.”
00:02:54 One source on the subject of flirting says
00:02:57 that it is a gigantic ego boost, an ego trip,
00:03:02 because the flirt is doing something for his or her own gratification,
00:03:06 to make himself or herself feel better.
00:03:10 But there’s something the apostle Paul wrote
00:03:12 that can balance our thinking about this trait of self-esteem
00:03:16 that imperfect humans tend to take to an extreme.
00:03:19 So let’s turn to Romans 12:3
00:03:24 and see what Paul has to say,
00:03:27 Romans 12:3;
00:03:30 he wrote:
00:03:32 “For through the undeserved kindness given to me,
00:03:34 “I tell everyone there among you not to think
00:03:37 “more of himself than it is necessary to think,
00:03:41 “but to think so as to have a sound mind,
00:03:44 each one as God has given to him a measure of faith.”
00:03:48 Well, self-esteem is defined
00:03:51 as “confidence and satisfaction in oneself,”
00:03:54 and it can range from self-respect to self-conceit.
00:03:58 Some people have too little of it; some people have too much of it.
00:04:02 So Paul wrote: “I tell everyone there among you.”
00:04:06 And what he tells us is how to avoid either extreme
00:04:09 of thinking too much or too little of our worth in God’s eyes.
00:04:14 And Paul pinpointed exactly where the problem lies
00:04:17 because three times in the verse he used the phrase “to think.”
00:04:21 He wrote that a person is “not to think more of himself
00:04:25 than it is necessary to think, but to think so as to have a sound mind.”
00:04:31 So it matters how one thinks about himself or herself.
00:04:35 Consider the person who has too little self-esteem.
00:04:39 Now, Paul said it is necessary to think something of ourselves.
00:04:44 It was never intended that modest, moral Christians
00:04:47 had to develop an inferiority complex.
00:04:49 Our dedicated relationship with Jehovah
00:04:53 makes each of us precious and desirable to God,
00:04:56 and we should really believe that.
00:04:59 So the one with low self-esteem
00:05:01 is not thinking enough of the right things about himself.
00:05:05 And what Paul wrote two verses earlier
00:05:09 in Romans chapter 12 can help.
00:05:12 So let’s look at verse 1 of Romans 12:
00:05:17 “Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers,
00:05:21 “to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,
00:05:23 “holy and acceptable to God,
00:05:26 a sacred service with your power of reason.”
00:05:30 Now, doesn’t that describe what we are endeavoring to do?
00:05:34 Haven’t we dedicated our lives to Jehovah?
00:05:37 Aren’t we striving to live holy lives?
00:05:40 Aren’t we performing sacred service
00:05:42 and making sacrifices for the sake of the Kingdom?
00:05:45 Certainly.
00:05:46 And all that is most acceptable to our God.
00:05:49 Our lives have real worth in Jehovah’s eyes,
00:05:53 so no one should have to resort to frivolous flirting to boost their ego.
00:05:59 Now, consider the person who has too much self-esteem.
00:06:02 In his efforts to gain self-confidence, he has overshot the mark
00:06:06 and has crossed the line
00:06:08 between cultivating self-respect and arrogance.
00:06:11 He’s overestimated his own worth and thinks too highly of himself,
00:06:15 and he may behave in an unpleasant way toward others,
00:06:18 as does the uncaring flirt.
00:06:21 Well, Paul said something that applies here too
00:06:24 at Romans 12:16,
00:06:26 verse 16:
00:06:29 “Have the same attitude toward others as toward yourselves;
00:06:33 “do not set your mind on lofty things, but be led along with the lowly things.
00:06:38 Do not become wise in your own eyes.”
00:06:41 So it’s important that we have a healthy,
00:06:44 balanced view of our own worth.
00:06:47 And remember, it is the way of our thinking
00:06:51 that Paul was cautioning us about,
00:06:53 because that governs whether our self-esteem is in balance or not.
00:06:58 No wonder that Paul said that we ought “to think so as to have a sound mind,”
00:07:03 that is, to have thoughts that are based on a true premise about ourselves.
00:07:08 Since it always helps to look at the example of Jesus,
00:07:11 let’s do that, in this case, by turning to Philippians chapter 2,
00:07:16 Philippians 2,
00:07:20 beginning with verse 5;
00:07:27 it says: “Keep this mental attitude in you
00:07:30 “that was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God’s form,
00:07:34 “gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.
00:07:39 “No, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and became human.
00:07:43 More than that, when he came as a man, he humbled himself.”
00:07:48 Well, in every facet of his life,
00:07:50 Jesus’ sound mind kept his self-esteem in perfect balance.
00:07:55 He never had too little or too much.
00:07:58 He never thought more of himself than was necessary to think.
00:08:02 We can never imagine Jesus trying to boost his ego
00:08:05 by flirting with Mary and Martha
00:08:08 or with any other woman who was in his company.
00:08:11 Paul said, ‘keep this mental attitude in you’ —Jesus’ mental attitude.
00:08:16 We should think the way Jesus thinks.
00:08:19 Now, note the context in which we find this admonition
00:08:23 in Philippians 2
00:08:26 by reading verses 3 and 4:
00:08:29 “Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism,
00:08:32 “[one Bible says: “Never act
00:08:34 “from motives of rivalry or personal vanity”]
00:08:38 “but with humility consider others superior to you,
00:08:41 “as you look out not only for your own interests,
00:08:44 but also for the interests of others.”
00:08:47 So we keep our egos in check,
00:08:50 we stay clear of any speech, dress, or flirtatious actions
00:08:55 that could be viewed as provocative,
00:08:57 and we thus maintain our chasteness toward everyone.

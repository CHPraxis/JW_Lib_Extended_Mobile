The scripture that we are highlighting today

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:04.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is 1 Timothy 5:2,

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.690 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which instructs Christian men

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to treat “older women as mothers, . . .

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:10.760 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“younger women as sisters,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with all chasteness.”

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:14.698 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the reverse is also true:

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christian women
should treat older men as fathers

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and younger men as brothers,
with all chasteness.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is taken from the <i>Watchtower</i>  article
entitled “We Can Remain Chaste,”

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:28.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one portion of which discusses the matter

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:31.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of flirting with the opposite sex.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My discussion is going to focus

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on keeping one’s ego in check.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what are
the connections between chasteness,

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flirting, and ego?

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s start with chasteness,

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, purity in thought and action.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it means “being free from all taint

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is lewd or salacious,”

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, what arouses or appeals

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sexual desire or imagination.

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one way to maintain our chastity

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to avoid the practice of flirting.

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:04.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is that?

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, flirting means ‘behaving amorously

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:10.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without serious intent.’

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a person signals romantic interest

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no intention of marriage.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:19.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may involve
an inappropriate remark, a look,

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a touch, the tone of voice, a coy smile,

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:28.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the way one dresses,
stands, or carries oneself.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some single people flirt with each other

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with married folks.

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:38.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some married people flirt with single people
or with other married people.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:41.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this degenerate world,

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
men flirt with men,
and women flirt with women.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s inappropriate for single people
to send romantic signals

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to each other just for amusement,

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is morally wrong for married people

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to direct that kind of attention
to a person outside of their marriage.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, an attorney
who practices family law reported:

00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:05.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I talk to plenty of people
who are going through divorce.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In most cases, these marriages are ending

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because someone had an affair,
and in all of those cases,

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:18.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the affair started out
as just a little harmless flirting.”

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, flirting is not harmless.

00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To intentionally toy
with the feelings of others is cruel.

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can arouse wrong desires and expectations

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may result in a lot of emotional pain.

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:35.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can also lead to worse things:
fornication or adultery.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no wonder that it has been said

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:41.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that flirts make poor friends
and worse marriage mates.

00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:44.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the world,
flirting is viewed as a sport,

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s done
to increase one’s own self-esteem.

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:51.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s where ego comes into the picture.

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ego is “the sense of one’s own worth.”

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One source on the subject of flirting says

00:02:57.694 --> 00:03:02.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is a gigantic ego boost, an ego trip,

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the flirt is doing something
for his or her own gratification,

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make himself or herself feel better.

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:12.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s something the apostle Paul wrote

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can balance our thinking
about this trait of self-esteem

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that imperfect humans
tend to take to an extreme.

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s turn to Romans 12:3

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what Paul has to say,

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:3;

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he wrote:

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For through
the undeserved kindness given to me, 

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I tell everyone there among you not to think

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“more of himself than it
is necessary to think,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but to think so as to have a sound mind,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one as God has given
to him a measure of faith.”

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, self-esteem is defined

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:54.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “confidence and satisfaction in oneself,”

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:58.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can range
from self-respect to self-conceit.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people have too little of it;
some people have too much of it.

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:06.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul wrote:
“I tell everyone there among you.”

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what he tells us is how
to avoid either extreme

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of thinking too much or too little
of our worth in God’s eyes.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul pinpointed exactly
where the problem lies

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:21.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because three times in the verse
he used the phrase “to think.”

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote that a person
is “not to think more of himself

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than it is necessary to think,
but to think so as to have a sound mind.”

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it matters how one thinks
about himself or herself.

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:39.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the person
who has too little self-esteem.

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:44.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul said it is necessary
to think something of ourselves.

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:47.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was never intended
that modest, moral Christians

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to develop an inferiority complex.

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dedicated relationship with Jehovah

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes each of us
precious and desirable to God,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we should really believe that.

00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the one with low self-esteem

00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not thinking enough
of the right things about himself.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:09.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what Paul wrote two verses earlier

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Romans chapter 12 can help.

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s look at verse 1 of Romans 12:

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, I appeal to you
by the compassions of God, brothers,

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to present your bodies
as a living sacrifice,

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“holy and acceptable to God,

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sacred service with your power of reason.”

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, doesn’t that describe
what we are endeavoring to do?

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:37.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haven’t we dedicated our lives to Jehovah?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we striving to live holy lives?

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we performing sacred service

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making sacrifices
for the sake of the Kingdom?

00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:46.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:49.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all that is most acceptable to our God.

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our lives have real worth in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:58.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so no one should have to resort
to frivolous flirting to boost their ego.

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, consider the person
who has too much self-esteem.

00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his efforts to gain self-confidence,
he has overshot the mark

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has crossed the line

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between cultivating
self-respect and arrogance.

00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s overestimated his own worth
and thinks too highly of himself,

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he may behave
in an unpleasant way toward others,

00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as does the uncaring flirt.

00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:24.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul said something
that applies here too

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:26.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:16,

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 16:

00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:33.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have the same attitude
toward others as toward yourselves;

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not set your mind on lofty things,
but be led along with the lowly things.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not become wise in your own eyes.”

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s important that we have a healthy,

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
balanced view of our own worth.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, it is the way of our thinking

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Paul was cautioning us about,

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:57.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that governs
whether our self-esteem is in balance or not.

00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder that Paul said that we ought
“to think so as to have a sound mind,”

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, to have thoughts that are based
on a true premise about ourselves.

00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since it always helps
to look at the example of Jesus,

00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s do that, in this case,
by turning to Philippians chapter 2,

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:18.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 2,

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning with verse 5;

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Keep this mental attitude in you

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was also in Christ Jesus,
who, although he was existing in God’s form,

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gave no consideration to a seizure,
namely, that he should be equal to God.

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, but he emptied himself and took
a slave’s form and became human.

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:47.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than that, when he came as a man,
he humbled himself.”

00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:50.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in every facet of his life,

00:07:50.786 --> 00:07:55.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ sound mind kept
his self-esteem in perfect balance.

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:58.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never had too little or too much.

00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never thought more
of himself than was necessary to think.

We can never imagine Jesus
trying to boost his ego

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by flirting with Mary and Martha

00:08:08.304 --> 00:08:11.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with any other woman
who was in his company.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said, ‘keep this mental attitude in you’
—Jesus’ mental attitude.

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should think the way Jesus thinks.

00:08:19.882 --> 00:08:23.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, note the context
in which we find this admonition

00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Philippians 2

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reading verses 3 and 4:

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[one Bible says: “Never act

00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from motives of rivalry or personal vanity”]

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with humility consider
others superior to you,

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as you look out
not only for your own interests,

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we keep our egos in check,

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we stay clear of any speech,
dress, or flirtatious actions

00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:57.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be viewed as provocative,

00:08:57.253 --> 00:09:01.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thus maintain
our chasteness toward everyone.

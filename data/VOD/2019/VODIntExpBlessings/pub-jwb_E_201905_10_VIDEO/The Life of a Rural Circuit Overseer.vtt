It’s 9:00 a.m.

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a Tuesday morning.

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:12.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A boat leaves the harbor in Belém,
a city in the north of Brazil.

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:15.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A traveling overseer
and his wife are on the boat,

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heading for a peaceful, rural island
where they will spend the week.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.979 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to the island of Cotijuba.

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:25.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s about an hour away.

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:27.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no cars on the island.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.354 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’ll arrive at the harbor, and there’ll probably

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:31.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
be some friends already waiting for us there.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:34.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll get a horse-drawn
or a motorcycle-drawn carriage,

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:37.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
load up our luggage,
and go to where we’ll be staying for the week.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The generosity of the friends is incredible.

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:45.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can’t do enough for us.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been preparing
to receive us for the last six months

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:52.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we can really feel that.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t give us just anything;
they give us their best.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice that often the friends don’t have

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very much financially—they really don’t.

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they prepare things for us
to eat or give us somewhere to stay

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things that sometimes they don’t have
for themselves during their day-to-day life.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:11.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just have to love them.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything we do
doesn’t compare to what they do for us.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Tuesday, after lunch, the circuit overseer

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:24.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starts analyzing
the congregation records with the elders.

00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:27.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, that evening,

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he delivers his first talk.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends really look forward to this.

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:33.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They go through so much in life

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:36.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this makes them feel looked after.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that I always make

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an effort to do is encourage the friends.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the key.

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:46.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the friends
already suffer a lot in this world.

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:48.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to help the sisters

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:50.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers
feel as comfortable as possible around me.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, every morning  and every afternoon

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the couple goes out with the congregation

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the preaching work,
on return visits, and Bible studies.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to cover
a large area because it’s a big island.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have lunch in one area,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you go to one end
of the island for a Bible study,

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then to the other end for a shepherding call.

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:20.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget
that the transportation available here

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:23.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is quite precarious
and it isn’t always available when you need it.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a busy morning in the ministry,

00:02:30.812 --> 00:02:33.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lunch is at a loving family’s home.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And of course, local dishes are a must!

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve arrived for lunch.

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:42.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at how many delicious things there are
—all traditional food.

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:44.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is maniçoba,

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a delicious local dish.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these are white beans—really tasty.

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else do we have here?

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:55.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caruru—a dish made

00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:58.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from okra and shrimp—full of flavor too.

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The couple’s week is full of activities
with an early start every morning,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they never forget
to feed themselves spiritually too.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While my husband is at the meeting
with the ministerial servants and elders,

00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:16.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I make the most of my time
by doing my personal study.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I tidy up a bit before he arrives.

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Months before the visit,

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:23.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we start looking forward
to the circuit overseer’s arrival

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we need
guidance and encouragement.

00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:28.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why the visit is really good for us,

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the members of the congregation,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the circuit overseer.

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we have the pioneer meeting,
we get a better idea of what we need to adjust

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where we need to improve.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we have
the meeting again six months later,

00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you realize how much
you’ve changed and that makes you

00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really happy and motivates you.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, it was a pleasure
for my wife and I to visit you this week.

00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really pleased
and encouraged by your good example,

00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:05.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by your zeal, and by your endurance.

00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your generosity made us very happy

00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:09.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the meals,

00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:11.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the care you showed us every day.

00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:15.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt your support throughout the visit

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in the mornings,

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the afternoons,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Bible studies—

00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the arrangements that were made.

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:26.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank you from our hearts

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:28.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of your care

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and excellent support during our visit.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it all begins again.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time,
in another congregation in another place.

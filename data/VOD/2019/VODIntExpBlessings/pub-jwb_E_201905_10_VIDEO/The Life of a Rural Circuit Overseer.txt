00:00:05 It’s 9:00 a.m.
00:00:06 on a Tuesday morning.
00:00:08 A boat leaves the harbor in Belém, a city in the north of Brazil.
00:00:12 A traveling overseer and his wife are on the boat,
00:00:15 heading for a peaceful, rural island where they will spend the week.
00:00:20 We’re going to the island of Cotijuba.
00:00:22 It’s about an hour away.
00:00:25 There are no cars on the island.
00:00:27 We’ll arrive at the harbor, and there’ll probably
00:00:29 be some friends already waiting for us there.
00:00:31 We’ll get a horse-drawn or a motorcycle-drawn carriage,
00:00:34 load up our luggage, and go to where we’ll be staying for the week.
00:00:41 The generosity of the friends is incredible.
00:00:43 They can’t do enough for us.
00:00:47 They’ve been preparing to receive us for the last six months
00:00:50 —we can really feel that.
00:00:52 They don’t give us just anything; they give us their best.
00:00:58 You notice that often the friends don’t have
00:01:00 very much financially—they really don’t.
00:01:03 But they prepare things for us to eat or give us somewhere to stay
00:01:05 —things that sometimes they don’t have for themselves during their day-to-day life.
00:01:09 You just have to love them.
00:01:11 Everything we do doesn’t compare to what they do for us.
00:01:18 On Tuesday, after lunch, the circuit overseer
00:01:21 starts analyzing the congregation records with the elders.
00:01:24 Also, that evening,
00:01:27 he delivers his first talk.
00:01:29 The friends really look forward to this.
00:01:31 They go through so much in life
00:01:33 and this makes them feel looked after.
00:01:36 One of the things that I always make
00:01:38 an effort to do is encourage the friends.
00:01:41 That’s the key.
00:01:43 I think the friends already suffer a lot in this world.
00:01:46 I try to help the sisters
00:01:48 and the brothers feel as comfortable as possible around me.
00:01:55 After that, every morning  and every afternoon
00:01:58 the couple goes out with the congregation
00:02:00 in the preaching work, on return visits, and Bible studies.
00:02:06 You have to cover a large area because it’s a big island.
00:02:09 So you have lunch in one area,
00:02:12 then you go to one end of the island for a Bible study,
00:02:15 then to the other end for a shepherding call.
00:02:17 And don’t forget that the transportation available here
00:02:20 is quite precarious and it isn’t always available when you need it.
00:02:28 After a busy morning in the ministry,
00:02:30 lunch is at a loving family’s home.
00:02:33 And of course, local dishes are a must!
00:02:35 We’ve arrived for lunch.
00:02:38 Look at how many delicious things there are —all traditional food.
00:02:42 This is maniçoba,
00:02:44 a delicious local dish.
00:02:46 And these are white beans—really tasty.
00:02:51 What else do we have here?
00:02:53 Caruru—a dish made
00:02:55 from okra and shrimp—full of flavor too.
00:03:01 The couple’s week is full of activities with an early start every morning,
00:03:05 but they never forget to feed themselves spiritually too.
00:03:10 While my husband is at the meeting with the ministerial servants and elders,
00:03:13 I make the most of my time by doing my personal study.
00:03:16 And then I tidy up a bit before he arrives.
00:03:18 Months before the visit,
00:03:21 we start looking forward to the circuit overseer’s arrival
00:03:23 because we need guidance and encouragement.
00:03:26 That’s why the visit is really good for us,
00:03:28 for all the members of the congregation,
00:03:31 and for the circuit overseer.
00:03:35 When we have the pioneer meeting, we get a better idea of what we need to adjust
00:03:38 and where we need to improve.
00:03:41 And when we have the meeting again six months later,
00:03:44 you realize how much you’ve changed and that makes you
00:03:47 really happy and motivates you.
00:03:52 Brothers, it was a pleasure for my wife and I to visit you this week.
00:03:58 We were really pleased and encouraged by your good example,
00:04:02 by your zeal, and by your endurance.
00:04:05 Your generosity made us very happy
00:04:07 —the meals,
00:04:09 the care you showed us every day.
00:04:13 We felt your support throughout the visit
00:04:16 —in the mornings,
00:04:18 the afternoons,
00:04:20 on Bible studies—
00:04:21 for all the arrangements that were made.
00:04:24 We thank you from our hearts
00:04:26 for all of your care
00:04:28 and excellent support during our visit.
00:04:34 And so it all begins again.
00:04:37 But this time, in another congregation in another place.

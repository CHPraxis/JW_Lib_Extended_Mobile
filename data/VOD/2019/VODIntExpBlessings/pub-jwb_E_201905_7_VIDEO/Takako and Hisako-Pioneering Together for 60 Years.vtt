Yes, true friends who share
our love for Jehovah are invaluable.

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in this story from Japan.

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:14.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters Takako Sato and Hisako Wakui

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:18.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have worked together as pioneers since 1957.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s learn how their friendship

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped them serve Jehovah with joy.

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pioneer partners.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been working together

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 60 years.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1956,

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was the only Jehovah’s Witness
in Nagano prefecture.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was lonesome,

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I applied for regular pioneer service.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surprisingly,

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was appointed
as a special pioneer.

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:55.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy that I found myself

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:58.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rolling around on the tatami-mat floor

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:01.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the appointment letter in my hand.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the way
I expressed my joy and appreciation.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was invited to serve

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a special pioneer,
I was sent to Nagano,

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s where I met Hisako.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takako and I focused on our ministry.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an isolated group was established,

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since there were no brothers,

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would wear a head covering
and conduct the meetings.

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:31.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the outlines were in English.

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t understand anything.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But people were delighted to hear

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even just the scriptures and went home satisfied,

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:45.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that strongly impressed on me
the power of God’s Word.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned
to a territory in the city after that.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:57.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found so many not-at-homes,

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:01.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were determined to meet people.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we changed the times we preached,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we talked to people on the street

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:07.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were going to work.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cherished even small opportunities.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we had a chance to meet a householder,

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we always tried to have a conversation

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could link to the next visit.

00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before long, I had ten Bible studies.

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takako acts like she’s cheerful,

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:33.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she’s been fighting various illnesses.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:37.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, it was so bad

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:40.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I could not even go out in service.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:44.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a serious skin condition.

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:46.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not bear

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:50.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at the illustration of Job in the magazine,

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:52.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I covered it up with paper.

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:59.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah helped me
to look to Job’s example.

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:02.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our endurance under trial

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would become praise to God.

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:12.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have often had health problems.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just at one of those times,

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received a letter from the branch.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said:

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you
can accomplish now may be limited.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, think
about all that you have done up to now

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give praise to Jehovah

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:37.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and about the people
you were able to help learn the truth,

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:42.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be joyful knowing
that you have been used by Jehovah fully.”

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t stop crying

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I really felt the care and concern

00:03:50.513 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the organization and from Jehovah.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hisako also
took really good care of me

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed with me.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our thinking and personalities are different,

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we made efforts to talk things out.

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heartfelt desire
to want to serve Jehovah full-time

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has always been the same.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 60 years, we’ve enjoyed

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a truly wonderful life of service to Jehovah.

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has supported us in difficult times

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the Bible, the organization, and friends.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have tasted the truthfulness of the words:

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:42.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am weak, then I am powerful.”

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When I said: “My foot is slipping,”

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:52.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your kindness, O Jehovah, has supported me.’

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:56.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say that too.

00:04:56.012 --> 00:04:59.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we don’t have energy or ability,

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:03.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve been able to enjoy
full-time service together up until now.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really content now.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all thanks to Jehovah.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the apostle Paul,
our sisters cultivated singleness

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focused on full-time service to Jehovah

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than 60 years.

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they face everyday challenges

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the extra ones that come with age,

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their heartfelt desire
to serve Jehovah whole-souled

00:05:33.616 --> 00:05:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings Takako and Hisako
real joy and contentment.

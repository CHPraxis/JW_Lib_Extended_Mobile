00:00:01 Let’s meet a sister who’s applied the counsel
00:00:05 to serve God from her youth on.
00:00:08 Sister Lillian Barnes is from Jamaica.
00:00:11 Her gifts to Jehovah may have changed with age,
00:00:15 but what she gives to him today
00:00:18 is in no way less valuable.
00:04:41 “Remember, then, your Grand Creator
00:04:44 in the days of your youth.”
00:04:47 That was Sister Barnes’ determination.
00:04:49 Lillian is now 108 years old
00:04:52 and has been baptized for nearly 82 years.
00:04:56 Her beautiful example shows the contentment
00:05:00 that comes from serving God whole-souled at any age.

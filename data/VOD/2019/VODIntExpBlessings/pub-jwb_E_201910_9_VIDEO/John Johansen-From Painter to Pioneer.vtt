Since I was a boy, whenever I saw

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a blank piece of paper,
I felt like drawing something.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1925

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Lillehammer, Norway.

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:24.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father received a brochure.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not that religious,

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but after reading it,
he started preaching straightaway.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family and neighbors
didn’t like it at all,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I listened to him

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he spoke about a paradise earth.

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found my father’s bag

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thought to myself,
‘Now it’s time for me to try.’

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also started telling
my classmates about it.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all decided to make fun of me,

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but one of them changed his attitude;

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he listened.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the war, it was possible

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for both of us to travel by train

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Oslo to get baptized.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later on, I returned
to Oslo to attend an art school.

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:37.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
I attended all the meetings.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There I met a former full-time minister,

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said to me,

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The happiest time
of my life was when I was

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the traveling work,
visiting the brothers.”

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:51.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It got me thinking,
‘Maybe that could be me one day.’

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a lot of work
as a painter in my hometown,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gradually I became known as an artist.

00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:07.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it took too much of my time.

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Matthew 24:14

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Kingdom should be preached.

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought:

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I need to do my part.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:20.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t just stand by
and let others do the work.’

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to start pioneering.

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’ve been
in the full-time ministry for about 70 years.

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:44.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life has been meaningful.

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:47.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have many good friends,

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inner peace, and joy.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a convention, I met Edith.

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has always been encouraging

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:21.180 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—actually, very encouraging.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After doing traveling work for several years,

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to return

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:58.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Lillehammer to pioneer

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if I could be of any use there,

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I found more than enough work to do.

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still paint occasionally.

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:14.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you get these ideas
you really want to put on the canvas.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I look forward to a paradise earth

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with peaceful,

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:26.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smiling people
who are joyful and happy.

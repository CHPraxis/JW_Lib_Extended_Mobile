The story of Armenia

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:08.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a story of faith

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the faith
of courageous brothers and sisters

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who endured mob violence,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protests, and threats

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who do not know God;

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:25.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith of young brothers
who were imprisoned

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they refused
to compromise their neutrality;

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the faith of lawyers

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who defended them
when they were arrested.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the early part of this period,

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work operated out of an office
in a local brother’s home.

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the story is much different.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 14, 2016,

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers in Armenia
were delighted to dedicate a group

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of new facilities
to accommodate future growth

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a branch facility

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(mainly located on six floors
of a local building),

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new Assembly Hall,

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also a school facility.

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dedication week
started off with a welcome night,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where many
traveled long distances to attend,

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some had not seen
each other for a long time.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve never been
to Armenia before,

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meeting the brothers
and sisters was such an experience.

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave us a really warm welcome.

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 90,

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided, “No more Armenia.”

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I’m 96, and Jehovah said,

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to Armenia.”

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing!

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:54.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing to see so many brothers
and sisters from different countries,

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we enjoyed a very,
very nice time with them.

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, we really enjoyed this.

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the spiritual gems
that we all enjoyed the most

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were during the dedication program
held at the end of the week.

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:15.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program was filled
with reports and interviews

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touched our hearts,

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:21.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Splane of the Governing Body
gave the dedication talk.

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your desire to dedicate

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the branch facilities, the Assembly Hall,

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the school facility to Jehovah today?

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could never have imagined
such a thing happening five years ago.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the time
that we arrived at the airport

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we saw
the brothers boldly holding up

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:48.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the jw.org sign with their badges,

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were just so overwhelmed
—so moved.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could feel as if
I’m in the Paradise today

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have so many guests
from different countries,

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could see their happy faces.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many years, to be in courts

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in legal battles for our brothers
as conscientious objectors

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to go to the court

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:16.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for fighting a case
for just one Kingdom Hall—

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suddenly to have a branch

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Assembly Hall
and school facilities right away,

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s for me kind of unbelievable.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today is a great day

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:30.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s people in Armenia.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:38.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, Jehovah has seen

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faithful obedience
of our brothers and sisters in Armenia.

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have witnessed Jehovah
‘open the floodgates of the heavens

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and actually empty out a blessing

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until there is no more want.’

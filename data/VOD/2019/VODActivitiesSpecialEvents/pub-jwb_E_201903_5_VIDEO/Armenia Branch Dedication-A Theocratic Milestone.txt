00:00:03 The story of Armenia
00:00:06 is a story of faith
00:00:09 —the faith of courageous brothers and sisters
00:00:12 who endured mob violence,
00:00:15 protests, and threats
00:00:17 from those who do not know God;
00:00:22 the faith of young brothers who were imprisoned
00:00:25 because they refused to compromise their neutrality;
00:00:29 and the faith of lawyers
00:00:32 who defended them when they were arrested.
00:00:36 In the early part of this period,
00:00:38 the work operated out of an office in a local brother’s home.
00:00:44 Today, the story is much different.
00:00:48 On May 14, 2016,
00:00:50 our brothers in Armenia were delighted to dedicate a group
00:00:54 of new facilities to accommodate future growth
00:00:57 —a branch facility
00:01:01 (mainly located on six floors of a local building),
00:01:06 a new Assembly Hall,
00:01:12 and also a school facility.
00:01:16 The dedication week started off with a welcome night,
00:01:19 where many traveled long distances to attend,
00:01:23 and some had not seen each other for a long time.
00:01:27 Well, we’ve never been to Armenia before,
00:01:29 and meeting the brothers and sisters was such an experience.
00:01:32 They gave us a really warm welcome.
00:01:36 When I was 90,
00:01:38 I decided, “No more Armenia.”
00:01:41 And now I’m 96, and Jehovah said,
00:01:45 “You’re going to Armenia.”
00:01:47 What a blessing!
00:01:51 It was amazing to see so many brothers and sisters from different countries,
00:01:54 and we enjoyed a very, very nice time with them.
00:01:58 Thanks to Jehovah, we really enjoyed this.
00:02:03 But the spiritual gems that we all enjoyed the most
00:02:06 were during the dedication program held at the end of the week.
00:02:12 The program was filled with reports and interviews
00:02:15 that touched our hearts,
00:02:18 and Brother Splane of the Governing Body gave the dedication talk.
00:02:22 Is it your desire to dedicate
00:02:25 the branch facilities, the Assembly Hall,
00:02:29 and the school facility to Jehovah today?
00:02:38 We could never have imagined such a thing happening five years ago.
00:02:41 From the time that we arrived at the airport
00:02:44 and we saw the brothers boldly holding up
00:02:46 the jw.org sign with their badges,
00:02:48 we were just so overwhelmed —so moved.
00:02:53 And I could feel as if I’m in the Paradise today
00:02:56 because we have so many guests from different countries,
00:02:59 and I could see their happy faces.
00:03:02 For many years, to be in courts
00:03:05 —in legal battles for our brothers as conscientious objectors
00:03:09 or to go to the court
00:03:12 for fighting a case for just one Kingdom Hall—
00:03:16 and suddenly to have a branch
00:03:18 and Assembly Hall and school facilities right away,
00:03:21 that’s for me kind of unbelievable.
00:03:24 Today is a great day
00:03:27 for Jehovah’s people in Armenia.
00:03:35 Truly, Jehovah has seen
00:03:38 the faithful obedience of our brothers and sisters in Armenia.
00:03:42 We have witnessed Jehovah ‘open the floodgates of the heavens
00:03:45 ‘and actually empty out a blessing
00:03:47 until there is no more want.’

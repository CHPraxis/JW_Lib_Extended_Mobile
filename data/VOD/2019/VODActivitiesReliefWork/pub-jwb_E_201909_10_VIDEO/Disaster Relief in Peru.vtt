We always see

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:11.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on JW Broadcasting®

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
experiences of how

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:14.034 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah takes care of other people.

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:15.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But you never think

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it’s going to happen to you.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:39.685 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’ve just never seen—

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:41.437 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t see the street or anything.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was so intense—the rain.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.942 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You could just sense the terror.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it was a raging torrent.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like the mountain was coming down.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city was under water.

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was so much water

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was chest high.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.010 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Even in the Kingdom Hall,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.012 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the level rose above the waist.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairs were just floating.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was shocking to see the amount of water

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was actually inside the Kingdom Hall.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one week, there were seven floods,

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and each one was just as bad as the last one.

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, I still didn’t understand how bad,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a brother said,
“Maybe you better come up to this area.”

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I got there, it was devastation.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it was a two-story house,

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:44.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first story was full of mud

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so now the second story was on street level.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.631 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In a rainfall of only five hours,

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
everything was swept away

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.885 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—all the houses of the brothers.

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got there the next day,
it seemed like a bomb had gone off.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was blown apart.

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We visited one family, and the brother said:

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can’t go to the meeting.
I don’t have a pair of shoes,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife just has
the clothes on her back.”

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the local sisters who lost everything

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked so hard to build a beautiful home

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a beautiful, comfortable home—

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was all destroyed
in a moment by a landslide.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to hear her say

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just like the Bible says that you
should ‘store up treasures in heaven,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where moth and rust do not consume’

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I wish I could put a picture
of it in my Bible so that every time

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it I’ll think of that.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had regrets.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just taught me
that service to Jehovah is always worthwhile.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can work so hard in this system of things
to have a comfortable life,

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:58.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there’s no guarantee;
we can lose it so quickly.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the service that we have to Jehovah

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:04.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it lasts forever;
it will never be destroyed.

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was time to get organized
with groups of brothers

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and help to clean up the homes
of the ones that were affected.

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed like everywhere you looked
there were brothers and sisters.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrived in trucks and buses
with buckets, brooms,

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mops to help clean out
the homes of those affected.

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were cleaning out one house, . . .

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . our very first house . . .

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . our very first house.

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the sisters were putting down bags

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put dirt on the bags.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then carrying them.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then carrying them, right?

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And somebody said,

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Man, it would be nice
to have a wheelbarrow.”

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we’re digging it out,

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a wheelbarrow . . .

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:48.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 . . . in the mud . . .

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . in the mud.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we said:
“Hey, there, Jehovah gave us a wheelbarrow!”

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:53.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we got the wheelbarrow out,
and that really helped.

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were going to one house
of a family of Witnesses.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very difficult to get
into the house because we couldn’t get

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:02.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the front door open
because of all the mud.

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:04.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we actually got into the house,

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was like, “Where do we start?”

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:07.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it was overwhelming.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was one brother who just stood there,

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:14.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching from inside the middle
of the house, wasn’t he?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
We kind of thought,

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:18.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why isn’t he helping?’

00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we realized
after a while that this was his house.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He explained that after each of the floods
during the week, he cleaned his house out.

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then another flood came,
and he cleaned his house out.

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:33.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did another one,
until it got to the sixth one.

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that, he’d lost all his energy,

00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all his spirit, so he just left it.

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t do anymore.

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we realized at that point
that it wasn’t just important

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and dig someone’s house out.

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was important
to take care of them as well.

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:53.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that during this disaster,

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:55.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of the friends

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needed spiritual encouragement,
and that’s what we really wanted to bring.

00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gave them a hug to show them
that we love them and appreciate them,

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:05.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they
went through a very hard time.

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:09.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as the Bible says
that when one member suffers,

00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:12.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rest of the body
also suffers and feels the pain,

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we could sense this
among the brothers there.

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:17.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even brothers
from the Branch Committee

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to the area,
visiting each publisher personally

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:25.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to encourage those
who had been affected by the disaster.

00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:28.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A special meeting
was arranged where they gave talks.

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:30.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All this helped us

00:05:30.392 --> 00:05:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see that Jehovah was there.

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:35.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was sending his servants to upbuild us.

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:37.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spirit of the Governing Body,

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:39.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also through the Branch Committee,

00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:41.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to show love to the brothers.

00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:44.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted us to make sure that they

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:47.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were spiritually strengthened
during these critical times.

00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:50.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re worried about you.

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:52.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are you?”

00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:55.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just hearing them say that
was like a pat on the back

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a hug from Jehovah saying,
‘You’re not alone;

00:05:57.961 --> 00:05:59.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have your brothers.’

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it’s one thing
to read about things like that,

00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:07.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to see it in action—that’s another thing.

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:10.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You definitely saw love.

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is our identifying mark, isn’t it?

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends were there
early in the morning and late at night,

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:19.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
walking through mud
—mud on their face,

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:23.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mud in their hair.

00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:26.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just really showed love
in many different ways,

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:29.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we just want to say
thank you to all the friends.

00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah understands

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we need and when we need it,

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:35.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he gives us more than what we expect.

00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:39.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see that no matter what happens,
Jehovah is always going to take care of us

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:41.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s awesome!

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:46.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Disaster Relief Committee
received a letter from a family.

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said, “The floods can destroy our home,

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they cannot destroy

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:56.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our love for Jehovah
and the love that we have for him

00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:58.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has for us.”

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:04.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know what situations

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:08.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers will have to face
as this system winds down to a finish.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one thing we know for certain

00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:14.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that we can count on the support
of Jehovah and his organization.

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:26.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not part of this organization,
what do we have?

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:27.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got nothing.

00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what nothing is.

00:07:29.803 --> 00:07:31.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I talk about people
losing homes and stuff,

00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:33.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those are just material things.

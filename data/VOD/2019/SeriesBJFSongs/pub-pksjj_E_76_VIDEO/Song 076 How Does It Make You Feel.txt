00:00:03 How does it make you feel  when you preach and teach with zeal,
00:00:12 When you know you’ve done your part to reach an honest heart?
00:00:21 Knowing you’ve done your best; then our God will do the rest.
00:00:30 Honest hearts he surely knows— all those to him disposed.
00:00:40 How does it make you feel when the words you speak appeal
00:00:49 To the ones whose heart is right for everlasting life?
00:00:59 Some people turn away, others might be led astray.
00:01:07 Still we’re glad to bear his name and witness just the same.
00:01:16 It makes us glad, and we rejoice to give our heart and mind and voice.
00:01:26 So may our sacrifice of praise continue all our days.
00:01:36 How does it make you feel, knowing God’s support is real,
00:01:45 And that he’s entrusted you to do the work we do?
00:01:54 Proudly we preach and teach, using bold but gracious speech,
00:02:03 Searching out deserving ones; this work will soon be done.
00:02:12 It makes us glad, and we rejoice to give our heart and mind and voice.
00:02:22 So may our sacrifice of praise continue all our days.

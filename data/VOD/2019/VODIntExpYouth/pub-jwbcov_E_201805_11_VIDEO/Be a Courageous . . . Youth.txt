00:00:03 My classmates and teachers always respected me,
00:00:05 but this year things were different.
00:00:07 My class was organizing a Christmas party.
00:00:10 I was asked to help, but I refused.
00:00:13 My classmates and even my teacher made fun of me.
00:00:18 I went to see the principal because I thought
00:00:21 he would understand me,
00:00:23 but unfortunately he didn’t.
00:00:25 I felt I had been treated unfairly.
00:00:28 After the conversation I went home and I immediately
00:00:31 started to pray.
00:00:33 I felt that the most important thing I could do
00:00:35 was to uphold Jehovah’s reputation.
00:00:37 For personal study, I considered the Young People Ask book,
00:00:41 chapter 20, “How Can I Get Along With My Teacher?”
00:00:44 It contained Matthew 7:12,
00:00:47 which says that you should treat others the way you want to be treated,
00:00:51 and that was just what I needed.
00:00:53 It showed how important it was to respect people,
00:00:56 even if they’re not nice to you.
00:01:00 So I decided to explain my position to the class.
00:01:05 I raised my hand and asked whether I could explain my position;
00:01:09 my teacher surprisingly agreed!
00:01:15 One classmate raised his hand,
00:01:17 and after I had answered his question,
00:01:19 another one, and so on.
00:01:24 Others entered the classroom.
00:01:25 Students, teachers, and even the principal came in and sat down.
00:01:31 Afterward, the principal had me come to his office.
00:01:34 I was really scared; I thought I was in trouble!
00:01:37 And finally, he stood up, shook my hand, and apologized.
00:01:42 I was walking home with this big smile when I met a classmate
00:01:46 who had so many questions.
00:01:48 I answered them, and before I knew it,
00:01:50 I was able start a Bible study with him at school.
00:01:53 Through prayer and personal study,
00:01:56 I developed the courage to uphold Jehovah’s name.

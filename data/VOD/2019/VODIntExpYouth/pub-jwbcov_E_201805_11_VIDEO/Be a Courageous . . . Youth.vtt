My classmates and teachers
always respected me,

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this year things were different.

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:10.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My class was organizing a Christmas party.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was asked to help, but I refused.

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My classmates and even my teacher
made fun of me.

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:21.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to see the principal
because I thought

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would understand me,

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but unfortunately he didn’t.

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt I had been treated unfairly.

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the conversation
I went home and I immediately

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to pray.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that the most
important thing I could do

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to uphold Jehovah’s reputation.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For personal study,
I considered the Young People Ask book,

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 20,
“How Can I Get Along With My Teacher?”

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contained Matthew 7:12,

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that you should treat others
the way you want to be treated,

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was just what I needed.

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It showed how important
it was to respect people,

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if they’re not nice to you.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to explain
my position to the class.

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I raised my hand and asked
whether I could explain my position;

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my teacher surprisingly agreed!

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One classmate raised his hand,

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after I had answered his question,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another one, and so on.

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others entered the classroom.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Students, teachers,
and even the principal came in and sat down.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward, the principal had me
come to his office.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really scared;
I thought I was in trouble!

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, he stood up,
shook my hand, and apologized.

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was walking home with this big smile
when I met a classmate

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had so many questions.

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I answered them, and before I knew it,

00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:53.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able start a Bible study
with him at school.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through prayer and personal study,

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:00.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I developed the courage
to uphold Jehovah’s name.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received an offer
to enter a university to further my studies.

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:12.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my teachers
and friends tried to persuade me

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to just take the offer.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity.

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we returned home

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from preaching or from meetings,

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
women from our neighborhood

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used to come to our home
and say things like:

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are you doing this to your child?

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She is such a good girl,

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:38.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she studies so well.

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So why can’t you

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:41.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send her to a good college?”

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked myself,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What would I like to do with my life?’

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw brothers and sisters

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moving into my congregation

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist in the field ministry,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this helped me to set and pursue

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:02.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual goals
so that I could eventually

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pioneer in my congregation.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all things, my father always helped us

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to view Jehovah as a real person.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, as for my mother,

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she serves as a regular pioneer.

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She shares the experiences she has had

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the joy she has felt in the ministry.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So soon after completing high school,
I started pioneering.

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To live a simple life,
I work on a vegetable farm.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this work provides me
with income that is just sufficient.

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though this work is difficult and tiring,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I go out to preach

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I meet with the Bible students
as well as the young ones

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who love and appreciate the Bible truth,

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:04.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it refreshes my heart
to see them—their desire

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their eagerness
to learn about the Bible.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 29:11 helped me to overcome

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:17.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pressures from others
with the firm belief that Jehovah

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is thinking of giving me a nice future

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a beautiful hope.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I have four Bible studies,
and my father,

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is not a Witness,

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:36.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also regularly attends meetings
and studies the Bible.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these blessings have helped me to see

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this life provides
true satisfaction and true happiness.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Choosing to serve Jehovah
was the best decision

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have made in my life.

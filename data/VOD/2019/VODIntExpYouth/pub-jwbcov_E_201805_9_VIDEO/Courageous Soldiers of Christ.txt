00:00:02 I received an offer to enter a university to further my studies.
00:00:09 So my teachers and friends tried to persuade me
00:00:12 to just take the offer.
00:00:16 Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity.
00:00:21 After we returned home
00:00:23 from preaching or from meetings,
00:00:25 women from our neighborhood
00:00:28 used to come to our home and say things like:
00:00:30 “Why are you doing this to your child?
00:00:33 “She is such a good girl,
00:00:35 “and she studies so well.
00:00:38 “So why can’t you
00:00:39 send her to a good college?”
00:00:43 So I asked myself,
00:00:45 ‘What would I like to do with my life?’
00:00:50 When I saw brothers and sisters
00:00:52 moving into my congregation
00:00:54 to assist in the field ministry,
00:00:57 this helped me to set and pursue
00:00:59 spiritual goals so that I could eventually
00:01:02 pioneer in my congregation.
00:01:07 In all things, my father always helped us
00:01:10 to view Jehovah as a real person.
00:01:16 Also, as for my mother,
00:01:18 she serves as a regular pioneer.
00:01:22 She shares the experiences she has had
00:01:25 and the joy she has felt in the ministry.
00:01:27 So soon after completing high school, I started pioneering.
00:01:33 To live a simple life, I work on a vegetable farm.
00:01:38 And this work provides me with income that is just sufficient.
00:01:43 Even though this work is difficult and tiring,
00:01:47 when I go out to preach
00:01:51 and when I meet with the Bible students as well as the young ones
00:01:55 who love and appreciate the Bible truth,
00:01:59 it refreshes my heart to see them—their desire
00:02:04 and their eagerness to learn about the Bible.
00:02:09 Jeremiah 29:11 helped me to overcome
00:02:13 pressures from others with the firm belief that Jehovah
00:02:17 is thinking of giving me a nice future
00:02:20 and a beautiful hope.
00:02:26 Now I have four Bible studies, and my father,
00:02:30 who is not a Witness,
00:02:32 also regularly attends meetings and studies the Bible.
00:02:38 All these blessings have helped me to see
00:02:41 that this life provides true satisfaction and true happiness.
00:02:49 Choosing to serve Jehovah was the best decision
00:02:53 I have made in my life.

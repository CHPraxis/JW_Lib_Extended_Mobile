00:00:02 When I was young, I had an internal struggle.
00:00:05 I was studying, but I was just doing it for my mom.
00:00:09 Just like any typical kid, I didn’t want to stand out or be different.
00:00:13 I walked ten minutes to school,
00:00:16 ten minutes to the Kingdom Hall, lived right in my territory.
00:00:19 So I was like in a little bubble.
00:00:22 So it was common to just bump into your classmates or people you know.
00:00:26 I didn’t know what their reaction would be.
00:00:29 Sometimes you imagine people laughing at you.
00:00:33 And I was afraid of endangering the friendship.
00:00:37 Because I was raised in a religiously divided household,
00:00:40 I always knew I had a choice.
00:00:43 But at the same time,
00:00:45 I would feel bad if I didn’t defend my faith, and my conscience would bother me.
00:00:49 So it was always a struggle —like, I knew what the right thing to do was,
00:00:52 but I didn’t have the courage to do the right thing.
00:00:55 I still clearly remember when I was 12,
00:00:58 just one day, out of the blue, I picked up a magazine on my own
00:01:02 and read it from cover to cover for the first time.
00:01:04 And that left a deep impression.
00:01:06 It just touched my heart that day.
00:01:08 And then I thought, ‘Oh, there must be  other books that I’m missing out on.’
00:01:10 So I just started reading other publications.
00:01:14 The brothers’ and sisters’ experiences really touched my heart.
00:01:17 I was always amazed
00:01:19 at the courage they had, and I always wanted to imitate that.
00:01:23 My mom’s Bible teacher started studying with me
00:01:26 and helped me to meditate more  on what I had learned.
00:01:30 She introduced the Insight book to me, and that tool really helped me
00:01:34 to dig deeper as I was doing personal study.
00:01:36 After doing it little by little,
00:01:40 I realized that studying is enjoyable
00:01:43 —especially when you study just for yourself
00:01:46 to deepen your faith in Jehovah—
00:01:48 and it gave me the courage that I needed.
00:01:51 At the beginning of every school year,
00:01:53 I would introduce myself  as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:55 It was not easy.
00:01:57 I would always pray, especially the night before that.
00:02:00 And then every year, it got easier and easier.
00:02:03 It took courage, but Jehovah helped me.
00:02:05 When classmates asked what I did over the weekend,
00:02:08 I would always mention spiritual activities.
00:02:10 And they would tell me their problems, and I would always try to think
00:02:13 of a Bible principle or an article that could help them.
00:02:18 One time, the class was given the assignment
00:02:21 to pick a topic for a persuasive speech.
00:02:24 So I decided to use that opportunity
00:02:27 to give a witness, and I chose the topic
00:02:29 “Evolution Versus Creation.”
00:02:31 The more I defended my faith,
00:02:34 the more I realized there was nothing to be afraid of.
00:02:36 After all, none of my classmates or teachers
00:02:39 ever had a bad reaction like I imagined they would.
00:02:42 I was able to regular auxiliary pioneer throughout high school.
00:02:46 That definitely served as a protection and kept me busy.
00:02:49 And right after high school, I was able to start regular pioneering.
00:02:53 One blessing is being able to have a good conscience,
00:02:55 knowing I didn’t try to hide who I am just to fit in.
00:02:59 It wasn’t easy at first, but gradually I realized
00:03:02 that having a relationship with Jehovah is something to be proud of.

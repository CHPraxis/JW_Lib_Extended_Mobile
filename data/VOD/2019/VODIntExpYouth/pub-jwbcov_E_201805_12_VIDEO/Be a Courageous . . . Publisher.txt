00:00:02 I thought that only those with an abundance
00:00:05 of mature knowledge and experience did special metropolitan public witnessing.
00:00:09 I thought: ‘I can’t do it; I’m too young.’
00:00:13 Still, I decided to send in the application.
00:00:18 I received the invitation in the mail within a month.
00:00:21 I suddenly felt really insecure and afraid.
00:00:26 So I prayed to Jehovah, “I can’t do this yet.”
00:00:32 I thought I wouldn’t be able to participate in this type of service feeling that way,
00:00:37 so I prayerfully did research to find some material that would help me.
00:00:43 I found an article about Moses.
00:00:45 It was an article that stressed
00:00:48 that even if we think we aren’t able to carry out an assignment,
00:00:51 with Jehovah’s power we can.
00:00:53 I also heard a talk that used Jeremiah 20:7.
00:00:58 I was encouraged when he said,
00:01:01 “Even though you might feel you can’t do something,
00:01:04 if Jehovah gives you the power to do it,
00:01:07 then you can do it.”
00:01:11 Actually, Jehovah saw my potential
00:01:14 and gave me the courage to perform this service,
00:01:17 even though I thought it was beyond my ability.
00:01:25 I am being shown time and time again that Jehovah draws people
00:01:30 who are sincerely interested in the Bible to the carts.
00:01:34 I’ve even experienced helping people
00:01:36 make a request for a Bible study by using my smartphone.
00:01:42 I’m really able to grow, thanks to this ministry,
00:01:45 and gain more joy from Jehovah than I ever thought possible.

I know about the Paradise
under God’s Kingdom,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I believe with all my heart
that better days will come.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes in this life, for me,
It’s hard to see the things unseen,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To feel the love I know is there
when my heart is in despair.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:44.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I know Jehovah’s near.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I say a prayer from the heart.
When worries overtake my mind,

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On his strength I can rely.
I’m not alone; I know he’s there.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have his words of comfort
And true friends who really care.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each day has its own anxieties.
So I take one day at a time;

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave tomorrow until tomorrow;
Peace is what I find

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day at a time.

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:50.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take these words I’ve said, my friend,
And know that I care.

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:59.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on the joys in life,
Not the burdens that we bear.

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about what God has done.
To show his love, he gave his Son.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never doubt; keep trusting him.
He gave his best so we could live.

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t give in to fear.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say a prayer from the heart.
When worries overtake our mind,

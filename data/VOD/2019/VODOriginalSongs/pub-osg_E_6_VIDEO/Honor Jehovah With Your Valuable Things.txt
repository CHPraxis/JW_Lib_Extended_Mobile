00:00:08 There’s nothing Jehovah could possibly need.
00:00:15 He made everything from the start.
00:00:20 So what can I give him, or how can I live
00:00:28 In a way that brings joy to his heart?
00:00:34 Now I know what it takes, so with each day that breaks
00:00:41 Here’s what I will do:
00:00:47 I’ll give to you, Jehovah, the best I have to give.
00:00:54 I’ll live for you, Jehovah, as long as I may live.
00:01:01 No matter what life brings,
00:01:07 I’ll honor you with my valuable things.
00:01:21 With love in your heart, you have given us life,
00:01:27 and I treasure the joy that it brings.
00:01:34 What more can I do to give honor to you,
00:01:41 Than to give you my valuable things?
00:01:47 Yes, I know what it takes, so with each day that breaks
00:01:54 I know what I will do:
00:02:01 I’ll give to you, Jehovah, the best I have to give.
00:02:08 I’ll live for you, Jehovah, as long as I may live.
00:02:14 No matter what life brings,
00:02:21 I’ll honor you with my valuable things.

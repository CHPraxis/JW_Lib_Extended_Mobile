00:00:19 Some days I feel I’ve had enough. The war in my mind can get so tough.
00:00:32 There’s days I feel there’s no way out. In a flood of tears, I’m sinking down.
00:00:43 In my despair, he sees me through. When I am crushed, I know just what to do.
00:00:56 I need his words of truth. I can hear Jehovah saying:
00:01:01 ‘Just a little while longer, And I will wipe out ev’ry tear.
00:01:13 ‘Just a little while longer, The new world is in sight.
00:01:20 ‘Just keep on holding tight.
00:01:24 ‘I’ll help you win this fight— Fight.
00:01:31 I’ll help you win this fight.’
00:01:38 Reading his Word gives me the power.
00:01:43 When storms in life come, he’s my strong Tower.
00:01:50 In my despair, he pulls me through. When I am down, I know just what to do.
00:02:02 I need his words of truth. I can hear Jehovah saying:
00:02:07 ‘Just a little while longer, And I will wipe out ev’ry tear.
00:02:19 ‘Just a little while longer, The new world is in sight.
00:02:27 ‘Just keep on holding tight.
00:02:30 ‘I’ll help you win this fight— Fight.
00:02:37 ‘I’ll help you win this fight. I’ll help you win this fight.
00:02:49 I’ll help you win this fight.’
00:03:01 ‘I’ll help you win this fight, Help you win this fight,
00:03:08 Help you win this fight.’
00:03:23 ‘Just a little while longer, And I will wipe out ev’ry tear.
00:03:34 ‘Just a little while longer, The new world is in sight.
00:03:42 Just keep on holding tight. I’ll help you win this fight.’

00:00:06 I’m just a cart made up of bits and pieces— A frame, a handle, and some wheels.
00:00:16 But I’m a cart that helps to give a witness. What is that like?
00:00:25 Let me tell you how it feels.
00:00:29 If you could see what I see, If you could visit all the places that I go,
00:00:41 If you could see the people there
00:00:46 And get a glimpse of all the faces that I get to know,
00:00:52 If you could hear what I hear
00:00:58 When they see things  they’ve never had a chance to see,
00:01:04 That’s when you’ll see how it can be That forever they’ll remember me.
00:01:15 I’ve got wheels; I’ve got racks; I’ve got books, and I’ve got tracts.
00:01:21 I take the Kingdom message ev’rywhere.
00:01:26 When the crowds pass me by, I’m designed to catch their eye.
00:01:32 Wherever people gather,  count on me ’cause I’ll be there.
00:01:40 If you could do what I do,
00:01:46 You’d know the happiness  that always fills my heart.
00:01:52 What a feeling to go wheeling! I’m so glad to be a public-witness cart.

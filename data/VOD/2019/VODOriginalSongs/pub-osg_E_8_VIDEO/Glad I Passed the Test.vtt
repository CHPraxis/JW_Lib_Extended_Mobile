Seems like there’s
something ev’ryday,

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:18.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some new test that comes my way—
something ev’ryday.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never know
what it might be,

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever it might be,
I know I have the key.

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Cause I can face it if I’m steady,
And prepare so I’ll be ready;

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:40.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How to act and what to say
When a challenge comes my way.

00:00:40.657 --> 00:00:46.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times it’s tough
for me out there,

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:51.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I turn
to God in prayer.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray I’ll pass each test—
Ev’ry one that comes my way.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray I’ll pass each test,
And be faithful through the day.

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:14.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some things
I know I’ll face again.

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:21.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the pressure to fit in—
face it once again.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be times
when other kids

00:01:25.268 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do the things that God forbids—
the things that God forbids.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:38.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And pressure me to go along with
Kids I know I don’t belong with.

00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the time
I call to mind

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:49.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to be that kind—
‘Cause I’m a Witness for God’s name.

00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no cause
to be ashamed.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:02:00.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad I passed the test.
I was faithful all day long.

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:09.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad I passed the test.
I’m glad that I was strong.

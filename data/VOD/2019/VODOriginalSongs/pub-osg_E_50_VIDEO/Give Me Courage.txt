00:00:17 Doubt and fear surround me— The way ahead not clear.
00:00:27 Through uncertainty you guide me; I know you’re always near.
00:00:37 Life may not be easy, But this I know is true:
00:00:46 You’re the God who’s ever loyal; My life is safe with you.
00:00:57 Jehovah, give me eyes of faith And help me always see
00:01:07 There are more with us than against us. Courageous let me be.
00:01:17 Courage, give me courage; With courage, I’ll endure.
00:01:27 Jehovah, give me courage; Your victory is sure.
00:01:40 Feeling fear is human. In my own strength, I’m frail.
00:01:50 You have been my rock and refuge; Your power never fails.
00:02:00 Help me be courageous, And let my heart be brave.
00:02:10 Lasting harm can never hold me— No prison, gate, or grave.
00:02:20 Jehovah, give me eyes of faith And help me always see
00:02:30 There are more with us than against us. Courageous let me be.
00:02:41 Courage, give me courage; With courage, I’ll endure.
00:02:50 Jehovah, give me courage; Your victory is sure.
00:03:18 Jehovah, give me eyes of faith And help me always see
00:03:27 There are more with us than against us. Courageous let me be.
00:03:39 Courage, give me courage; With courage, I’ll endure.
00:03:48 Jehovah, give me courage; Your victory is sure.
00:03:59 Jehovah, give me courage; Your victory is sure.

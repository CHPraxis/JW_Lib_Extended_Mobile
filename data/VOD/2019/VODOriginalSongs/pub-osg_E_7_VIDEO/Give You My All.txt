00:00:08 So many choices that I could make; So many pathways that I could take.
00:00:16 I know that someday I’ll make my vow; How will I know if that time is now?
00:00:24 I’ve seen the blessings that come to those Who take their stand for you.
00:00:30 This isn’t something somebody chose for me; It’s something I want to do.
00:00:40 I want to stand up on my two feet; I want to answer the call.
00:00:49 I want to have your help when I am weak; I want to give you my all.
00:00:57 I want to give you my all.
00:01:07 I want to know you and be your friend; I want the life that’ll never end.
00:01:16 I know you’re real; it’s plain to see. No other God could there be for me.
00:01:24 Life’s not a party, not just for fun; The journey’s just begun.
00:01:32 I want to give you  my best while I’m still young,
00:01:36 To side with you and your son.
00:01:39 I want to stand up on my two feet; I want to answer the call.
00:01:49 I want to have your help when I am weak; I want to give you my all.
00:01:56 I want to give you my all. I want to give you my all.
00:02:11 I want to give you my all.

00:00:11 There’s trouble in the world, disunity. No matter where we live, no harmony.
00:00:27 There are people suffering, fighting for change.
00:00:33 But among God’s people, we trust in his name.
00:00:39 So we must stick close to his Word And remain no part of this world
00:00:48 With love in ev’ry little thing we do.
00:00:54 Show love as we spread the good news, And feel the love of the brotherhood.
00:01:04 Though we stand out as diff’rent, With Jehovah, we are one.
00:01:21 No matter where we go from sea to sea, With God’s people, we find true family.
00:01:31 Yes, there are anxieties, but hope is real— A paradise to come.
00:01:39 True peace is near.
00:01:41 So we keep trusting in his Word And remain no part of this world
00:01:51 With love in ev’ry little thing we do. Show love as we spread the good news,
00:02:02 And feel the love of the brotherhood.
00:02:08 Though we stand out as diff’rent, With Jehovah, we are one.
00:02:13 We are one.
00:02:23 So let’s stay faithful and endure And remain no part of this world
00:02:34 With love in ev’ry little thing we do. Show love as we spread the good news,
00:02:45 And feel the love of the brotherhood. Though we stand out as diff’rent,
00:02:53 With Jehovah, We love in ev’ry little thing we do.
00:03:01 Show love as we spread the good news, And feel the love of the brotherhood.
00:03:11 Though we stand out as diff’rent, With Jehovah, we are one.

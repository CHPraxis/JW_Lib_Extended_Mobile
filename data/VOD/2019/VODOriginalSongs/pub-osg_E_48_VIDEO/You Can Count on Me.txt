00:00:10 Time and circumstance Don’t always work in our favor.
00:00:21 What might have been if we just had the chance
00:00:26 Is something we may never know.
00:00:33 But God looks down and sees; He knows us better than we do.
00:00:44 He sees what we are and what more we could be.
00:00:50 It’s all in the way that we go.
00:00:56 He values all of us, No matter what talent or gift we possess.
00:01:07 He wants each one of us To be as caring as he is.
00:01:18 So you’re my friend ’cause you’re always there
00:01:23 Through our ups and downs and through all we’ve shared.
00:01:28 And I’m there  When you need someone,
00:01:33 when things are hard to bear.
00:01:36 I’ll be the friend you need. You can count on me.
00:01:50 We weep with those who weep, Sharing the things that we’re feeling.
00:02:01 But sometimes our tears may be all that can speak,
00:02:07 Expressing what words cannot say. Troubles can bring us down.
00:02:18 Jehovah can lift us and carry us through.
00:02:24 We all can do the same And help each other as friends do.
00:02:35 And you’re my friend ’cause you’re always there
00:02:41 Through our ups and downs and through all we’ve shared.
00:02:45 And I’m there When you need someone,
00:02:49 when things are hard to bear.
00:02:53 I’ll be the friend you need. You can count on me.
00:03:19 And you’re my friend ’cause you’re always there
00:03:25 Through our ups and downs and through all we’ve shared.
00:03:29 And I’m there When you need someone,
00:03:33 when things are hard to bear.
00:03:37 I’ll be the friend you need. You can count on me.

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:03.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let me ask you this:

00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what OPI stands for?

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:12.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find that out and a lot more

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:14.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the following report,

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:17.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which will be given by Brother Paul Gillies,

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:22.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as the overseer of OPI.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 12:10 says:

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The congregator sought to find

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“delightful words and to record

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accurate words of truth.”

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with this principle,

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Office of Public Information, OPI,

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters has, over the years,

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
been assigned by the Governing Body

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey accurate information

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the news media and academics.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:55.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as Satan intensifies
his slanderous attacks

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s people
and opposers feed authorities

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with twisted
and distorted statements about us,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OPI’s assignment now includes

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveying accurate words of truth

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to government officials.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this report, we’d like to explain to you

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how and why this work is done

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:17.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also relate a few experiences.

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are Scriptural precedents 
for contacting government officials.

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:26.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah positioned
his servants before rulers

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to protect his people
and to further his purposes.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Examples include Joseph before Pharaoh,

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah before King Artaxerxes,

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther and Mordecai before King Ahasuerus,

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:43.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Paul before Felix.

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we do not need
the permission of governments

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet and to preach.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do recognize
that having religious freedom

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cooperation of officials

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is conducive to spreading
the Kingdom message.

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While remaining politically neutral,

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we provide accurate information

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘kings and all those in high positions

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:10.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we may go on leading
a calm and quiet life,’

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as 1 Timothy 2:2 states.

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, brothers
from OPI met with officials

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to address specific issues
hindering our work

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Azerbaijan, Belarus,

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia, and Central Asia.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July, a meeting
was held with the prime minister

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one African country to explain

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reasons for our Christian neutrality.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reports such as these

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that document incidents of injustice

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are provided to officials.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:44.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many express appreciation
for this information.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a recent meeting 
held in Congo (Kinshasa),

00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:51.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an embassy official
commenting on the quality

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:53.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these reports stated,

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They remain objective and moderate

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the seriousness of the facts.”

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we don’t take the initiative

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide accurate information,

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:08.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government officials
may receive misinformation

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from opposers trying
to influence them to act against us.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:15.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, while it takes time and effort

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:18.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to counteract lies and misinformation,

00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have often experienced the truthfulness

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Proverbs 25:15 tells us:

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:28.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By patience a commander is won over,

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a gentle tongue can break a bone.”

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s now share
with you some experiences

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:36.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that demonstrate the benefit

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of contacting both government officials

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the media.

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:46.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding Russia,
OPI keeps various officials

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:49.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world informed
of the ongoing harassment

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unjust detentions of our brothers.

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, many of these authorities

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have issued strongly worded statements

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
condemning the ban in Russia,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of which you can find 
on the jw.org “Newsroom.”

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile, OPI communicated
with journalists about Russia,

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of whom wrote a very interesting article

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:14.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the international edition of Newsweek.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This article appeared on the front cover.

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this one outlet alone has published

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 30 articles about the oppression

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses
not just in Russia but other countries.

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:33.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each year in Uzbekistan,

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers experience police raids,

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
detentions, fines,

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sadly,
in some occasions, severe beatings.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is just
for carrying out their Christian ministry.

00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:47.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, often the reason for that

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because we have been consistently

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
denied registration.

00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:55.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This photograph shows
some brothers and sisters

00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are maintaining
their joy despite all of them

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having been fined exorbitant amounts.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now interestingly, on May 14, 2018,

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ambassador from Uzbekistan

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:13.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the United States
said this in Washington D.C.,

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:18.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s Witnesses
will be able to register much easier.”

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So seizing this opportunity,

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a delegation of brothers was approved

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to travel to Uzbekistan last month

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and held preliminary discussions

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with government representatives.

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it be Jehovah’s will,

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we certainly pray that these efforts will lead

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to national registration

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some relief for our brothers

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have endured persecution.

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:47.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where appropriate,
OPI also helps branches

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to organize public events

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in areas where our work
is often misrepresented.

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, in Kazakhstan,

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there have been some obstacles,

00:05:57.874 --> 00:06:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local officials and communities

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have recently demonstrated a willingness

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn more about Jehovah’s people.

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:09.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, the branch hosted
a series of open house events

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:12.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Kingdom Halls in select locations.

00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A number of officials, media representatives,

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other professionals
attended these events.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A government ministry
wrote to the brothers stating,

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These events will provide
the citizens of our country

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an opportunity
to learn more about the activities

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Kazakhstan and worldwide.”

00:06:37.013 --> 00:06:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Sri Lanka,

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:42.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the cardinal of the Catholic Church
wrote to the president

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other representatives of the government

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demanding that they cancel

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:52.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the special convention
that was scheduled for just last July.

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did the cardinal not get his way

00:06:56.732 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but favorable government ministers
actually invited the branch

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:03.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold a press conference
to publicize the convention.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:07.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After OPI prepared
the Sri Lanka branch for the event,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
approximately 45 media representatives

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended the press conference held at Bethel.

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:17.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the journalists
who attended this press conference

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:19.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also attended the special convention

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:23.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and published positive news stories.

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So instead of the clergy
successfully influencing

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government officials
to cancel the convention,

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these officials
actually assisted us in publicizing it.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the tools that we use

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:40.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for conveying accurate information

00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:43.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the media and government officials

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the “Newsroom” section of jw.org.

00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, seeing the need

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brotherhood
to have a source of reliable reports

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about current events
involving Jehovah’s people,

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the majority of articles are now written

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with you in mind.

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:06.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quite a few have expressed appreciation

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:09.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the “Imprisoned for Their Faith” feature,

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is now updated monthly

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allows us to mention

00:08:14.377 --> 00:08:17.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imprisoned brothers by name in our prayers.

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as an example, these are the faces

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some of our young brothers in Turkmenistan

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:27.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been imprisoned
as conscientious objectors

00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:30.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during 2018.

00:08:31.494 --> 00:08:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold:

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will be hated by all the nations

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on account of my name.”

00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we recognize that no amount of effort

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to educate government officials

00:08:43.906 --> 00:08:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to change that.

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:50.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Pharaoh, some of the world’s dictators

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:53.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘harden their hearts’ against Jehovah.

00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:56.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jesus also foretold:

00:08:56.652 --> 00:08:59.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will be brought
before governors and kings

00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:02.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for my sake, for a witness

00:09:02.592 --> 00:09:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to them and the nations.”

00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:10.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just OPI that is giving
a witness to the governments,

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is every brother and sister
that officials come in contact with.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:18.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve often heard
a government official say

00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they know either
a schoolmate, a former workmate,

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a relative
who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, each and every brother

00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:31.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in prison is giving a witness.

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:35.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, on July 15, 2018,

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:39.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during a press interview,
the prime minister of Armenia

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commented on his contact
with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was a political prisoner.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:49.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There were prisoners, Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:09:49.572 --> 00:09:52.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who were there for not serving in the army.

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:55.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These people were convinced

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:57.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about their beliefs.”

00:09:57.713 --> 00:10:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he added,
“You don’t have to agree with them,

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you could feel it was their conviction.”

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:09.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who knows if someone
who observes your conduct

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:13.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or who you talk to
in field service or on public transport

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be the very person

00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:18.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who one day is in a government position

00:10:18.668 --> 00:10:20.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knows something
about Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what you did or said.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, we couldn’t do the work at OPI

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without you brothers and sisters

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
setting such a fine example.

00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:36.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who work
in the Office of Public Information

00:10:36.152 --> 00:10:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction
of the Coordinators’ Committee

00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider it a real privilege
to support all of you

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by communicating
with government officials

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:48.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and representatives
of the media and academia

00:10:48.464 --> 00:10:51.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—by conveying our beliefs and practices

00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:54.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “accurate words of truth.”

00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:11.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you kindly, Brother Gillies,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that thought-provoking update

00:11:14.223 --> 00:11:17.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the important work being done

00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Office of Public Information.

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:24.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how quickly I learned
the meaning of that acronym.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you remember
from a previous annual meeting,

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Herd especially likes acronyms.

00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:35.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gillies,
we know Britain misses having you,

00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:37.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re very happy to have you

00:11:37.813 --> 00:11:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with us here at headquarters.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:46.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you will have to learn how
to correctly say, “schedule.”

00:11:51.026 --> 00:11:53.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we love you anyway.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let me ask you this:

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it seem like

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:05.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters around the globe

00:12:05.074 --> 00:12:10.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being pummeled
with more and more natural disasters?

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ll find out.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother John Ekrann,

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as a helper

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Coordinators’ Committee,
will give us the facts.

00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find it very interesting.

00:12:21.023 --> 00:12:23.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ekrann, please.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two thousand seventeen and 2018

00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:29.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were certainly record years for disasters.

00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at a few of the headlines

00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the news in 2017 and 2018.

00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:38.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were earthquakes in Mexico,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plague in Madagascar, 
food shortages in Venezuela

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:44.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—disasters are going to get worse—

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
war in Congo,
deadly Nipah virus in India,

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:51.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a volcano erupts in Guatemala,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
violence in Cameroon,

00:12:53.656 --> 00:12:56.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ebola in the DRC.

00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we are not surprised

00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:01.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we see
the increased frequency

00:13:01.597 --> 00:13:03.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and intensity of disasters

00:13:03.632 --> 00:13:06.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as fulfillment of Bible prophecy.

00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:09.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look at Luke chapter 21

00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:12.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look at verses 10 and 11,

00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he said to them:
‘Nation will rise against nation,

00:13:20.249 --> 00:13:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and kingdom against kingdom.

00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘There will be great earthquakes,

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and in one place after another

00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food shortages and pestilences.’”

00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:31.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are actually witnessing

00:13:31.927 --> 00:13:35.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can see
the fulfillment of Jesus’ words.

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are seeing ‘earthquakes

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one place after another’

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:48.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and truly great earthquakes
as Jesus described.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Volcanoes dump huge amounts
of ash and smoke into the air.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:59.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tornadoes, hurricanes,
and typhoon winds

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
destroy buildings and property.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rain and flooding
from these huge storms

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:06.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause rivers to overflow

00:14:06.962 --> 00:14:11.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and damage large areas
of lands and property,

00:14:12.468 --> 00:14:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
causing mud and debris
to flow into buildings

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this expandable Kingdom Hall.

00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wildfires engulf both forests

00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and communities in flames and smoke,

00:14:22.144 --> 00:14:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leaving only behind the charred remains

00:14:26.482 --> 00:14:28.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what was once called home.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when there is a disaster,

00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us are keenly interested to know,

00:14:34.657 --> 00:14:37.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How are our brothers
and sisters doing?’

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “JW News” section of jw.org

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is regularly updated with news

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how our brothers and sisters
are affected by a certain disaster.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just here, we see some
of the headlines

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:55.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are on “JW News” lately,

00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:58.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we encourage you
to read this section regularly

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay up-to-date.

00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:03.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to show you the size and scale

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of disasters lately, look at this map

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we plot on it the disasters that have occurred

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just the last service year.

00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:13.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you notice the number of brothers

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:15.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are affected?

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
close to half a million of our brothers

00:15:21.937 --> 00:15:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were directly affected by these disasters

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just the last couple of years?

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s sad to say that 22
of our brothers and sisters

00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died in these disasters

00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:36.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 84 were seriously injured.

00:15:37.453 --> 00:15:41.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tens of thousands of our brothers
have had to find new homes.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:46.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And of these, 14,000 had to
completely flee their homeland.

00:15:46.595 --> 00:15:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we want all of you to know

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:52.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been affected
by many of these disasters

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in the last couple of years

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we love and pray for you.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are not lost or forgotten.

00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says at Isaiah 49:15:

00:16:04.747 --> 00:16:07.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I would never forget you.”

00:16:07.783 --> 00:16:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, proof that Jehovah
has not forgotten you

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:14.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the love of your brotherhood.

00:16:14.023 --> 00:16:16.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Acts chapter 2
describes in the first century

00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:20.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the brothers then
took care of one another.

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:23.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts chapter 2 describes
how our brothers

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:25.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were willing to sell
properties and possessions

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:27.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help one another out.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:31.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Acts chapter 11,
the brothers sent relief aid

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who were facing
a very great famine.

00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:38.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how has
our united brotherhood responded

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to these disasters today?

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:44.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s a fine phrase
in Philippians 1:27

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can show, really,
how our brothers and sisters

00:16:48.323 --> 00:16:50.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of us—
are helping one another.

00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:54.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 1:27, it says:

00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:57.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only behave in a manner worthy
of the good news about the Christ,

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that whether
I come and see you or I am absent,

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:03.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I may hear about you and learn

00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:05.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you are standing firm in one spirit,

00:17:05.074 --> 00:17:07.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with one soul,
(and here’s the phrase)

00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“striving side by side

00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the faith of the good news.”

00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one very big way

00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can ‘strive side by side’
in helping one another

00:17:19.354 --> 00:17:22.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by our donations
 to the worldwide work.

00:17:23.492 --> 00:17:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This chart gives you an idea

00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the cost of disasters

00:17:27.763 --> 00:17:30.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they’ve jumped in 2018.

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:32.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see, we spent on an average

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between five and seven million dollars

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on disaster relief in past service years.

00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:41.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But look, though, what has happened in 2018.

00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just in 2018, it has climbed

00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:48.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to over 33 million dollars.

00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:51.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what will happen in 2019?

00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:53.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will we see?

00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:57.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s already off
to a big start in September.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body asked
that I pass along to all of you

00:18:00.996 --> 00:18:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks and appreciation
for your generous donations.

00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:07.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would like to assure you

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:09.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your donations
are being put to good use

00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping in one disaster after another.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another way
that we as a brotherhood

00:18:17.246 --> 00:18:19.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work side by side

00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is volunteering to assist in a disaster.

00:18:24.553 --> 00:18:27.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thousands of our brothers and sisters

00:18:27.322 --> 00:18:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have willingly volunteered
to reconstruct or repair Kingdom Halls

00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our brothers’ and sisters’ homes.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others carry and deliver food, water,

00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many other items needed
after a disaster

00:18:39.735 --> 00:18:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our brothers

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:46.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using any transportation means possible:

00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:49.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
horses, boats, trucks.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:52.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some volunteer
with paint rollers and brushes.

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others show up with shovels
to clean up after a disaster,

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:59.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepare meals for the workers,

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put supply packages together,

00:19:01.356 --> 00:19:04.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sort, bag,

00:19:04.626 --> 00:19:07.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deliver them
—all with a smile.

00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:09.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at all these happy faces!

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:13.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to thank all of you

00:19:13.101 --> 00:19:16.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have worked so hard
on disaster relief,

00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the last couple of years.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also want to thank
the departments at headquarters,

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Branch Committees,
the branch departments,

00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:29.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the circuit overseers, LDCs,
disaster relief committees,

00:19:29.051 --> 00:19:31.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you elders worldwide

00:19:31.386 --> 00:19:34.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have really pitched in
and helped so much

00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with disaster relief efforts
the past couple of years.

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:39.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:42.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do
our brothers and sisters feel

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about your love and support?

00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:47.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you watch this next video,

00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:51.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to read
to you a sentence or two

00:19:51.373 --> 00:19:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from different letters
of appreciation

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:56.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers
have sent in following a disaster:

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:05.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah knows
when we’re in need, and he spoils us

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:08.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by giving us
even more than we ask for.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your deep concern
as well as the spiritual, emotional,

“and material support you’ve provided
and that we’re still receiving

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:22.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a real soothing ointment
that can help us to endure.

“When we see our belongings
covered with mud brought outside

“and thrown as garbage,

arrived at my home, I burst into tears.

because I was going to get a new house

Jehovah’s hand in my life.

was not limited to my house.

00:21:46.488 --> 00:21:50.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

are going to intensify

as we get closer
to the end of this system.

00:21:57.232 --> 00:22:00.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the phrase

‘It may suggest that like birth pains

Who knows?

00:22:16.985 --> 00:22:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

to need help from your brothers.

Be prepared, but at the same time,

don’t put trust
in money or your belongings.

As we face increasing disasters,

00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:44.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s continue side by side

to help everyone

—each one of us—
to survive this old system.

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:08.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate very much, Brother Ekrann,

that enlightening report that you gave us.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those were
some necessary announcements

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:18.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you needed to know about,

00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:20.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have two more

00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very exciting announcements.

00:23:23.085 --> 00:23:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thought it would be better
if you were seated for these.

00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first one:

00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:33.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has approved

As a result, the overall appearance

00:24:17.405 --> 00:24:21.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should see certain improvements
within a few months.

00:24:21.309 --> 00:24:24.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this time,
less than six months does apply.

00:24:24.913 --> 00:24:26.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do you think of that?

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:40.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one more very exciting announcement

00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially for our field missionaries,

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:47.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of whom may be here in attendance,

00:24:47.102 --> 00:24:50.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be happy you were seated:

00:24:50.372 --> 00:24:53.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For nearly 75 years,

00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:56.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead-trained missionaries

00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:59.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been serving in the worldwide field,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opening up new territories

00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:04.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as strengthening the brotherhood.

00:25:04.686 --> 00:25:07.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority
of these missionaries continue to serve

00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:12.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in field assignments
and have gained valuable experience.

00:25:12.294 --> 00:25:15.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pleased to inform you

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body has given approval

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:21.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all field missionaries

00:25:21.303 --> 00:25:24.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an FMF enrollment

00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:26.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been serving

00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:30.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for at least five years to attend

00:25:30.312 --> 00:25:34.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the School of Kingdom Evangelizers—SKE.

00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:37.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This provision will reinforce

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:39.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spirituality of these dear ones.

00:25:39.988 --> 00:25:43.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be mixed into the SKE classes

00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:45.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with new students

00:25:45.393 --> 00:25:48.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to allow others to benefit from their experience.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approved missionaries will attend SKE

00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:55.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the location of the school of the country

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to which they are assigned.

00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:15.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all very happy

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:19.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you hard-working field missionaries.

00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:22.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, Brother Herd
has a couple more acronyms

00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:24.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of this announcement

00:26:24.933 --> 00:26:28.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the FMF enrollment

00:26:28.703 --> 00:26:32.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and SKE classes.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Brother Herd,
I hope you took note of that.

00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:40.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, for the next one hour
and twenty minutes,

00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:43.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to get to enjoy

00:26:43.151 --> 00:26:46.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some very exciting, fast-moving,

00:26:46.121 --> 00:26:49.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enlightening talks

00:26:49.124 --> 00:26:52.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
given by five different members
of the Governing Body.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice, I highlighted
that word “enlightening.”

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our leadoff speaker

00:26:57.932 --> 00:26:59.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Brother Kenneth Cook

00:26:59.934 --> 00:27:04.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will present the talk,
“We Should Be Teachers.”

00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:05.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Cook.

00:27:06.908 --> 00:27:09.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a convention, we often say

00:27:09.944 --> 00:27:13.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the teaching
was better than ever.

00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:16.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even the best teachers
at this convention

00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or your convention
or on today’s program

00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:22.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are no match
for the Great Teacher.

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:26.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was an exceptional teacher.

00:27:26.094 --> 00:27:29.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine what it would have been like
to hear Jesus teach.

00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:32.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What made him so effective?

00:27:32.133 --> 00:27:34.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have to guess.

00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:38.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a few of the methods
that he used in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:27:38.606 --> 00:27:41.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, his introduction

00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:44.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
aroused interest and introduced his subject.

00:27:44.813 --> 00:27:48.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew chapter 5, for example,

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:51.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 3, Jesus simply said:

00:27:51.386 --> 00:27:55.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are those conscious
of their spiritual need.”

00:27:55.824 --> 00:28:00.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That simple statement
provided the interest for his listeners.

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:04.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would want to know,
‘How would this make me happy?’

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then added:

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:10.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . since the Kingdom
of the heavens belongs to them.”

00:28:10.472 --> 00:28:12.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is the subject

00:28:12.474 --> 00:28:16.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he consistently used
to mark his teaching.

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:21.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also used effective questions
to reason with his listeners.

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He crafted simple
but powerful illustrations.

00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:28.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if birds and lilies were on hand,

00:28:28.323 --> 00:28:31.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps he was actually using visual aids

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:33.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during that Sermon on the Mount.

00:28:33.428 --> 00:28:35.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, his conclusion was simple;

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was brief and motivating.

00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:42.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder Jesus’ listeners
were astounded!

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jesus expect us

00:28:44.672 --> 00:28:47.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be merely astounded
at his teaching, though?

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:48.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:28:48.743 --> 00:28:53.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He commissioned his disciples
to ‘go preaching and teaching.’

00:28:53.581 --> 00:28:56.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul later plainly told
the Hebrew Christians:

00:28:56.718 --> 00:28:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You should be teachers.”

00:28:58.787 --> 00:29:03.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was effective teaching
so necessary then and now?

00:29:03.758 --> 00:29:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because lives are involved.

00:29:06.628 --> 00:29:11.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, Satan is waging war
for the hearts of your children,

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:16.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s never been more important
to inculcate the truth in them.

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means their life.

00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:22.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders, our fellow worshippers
are battered by this system,

00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s never been more important

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:27.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage
and strengthen them to endure.

00:29:27.949 --> 00:29:30.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means their life.

00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:33.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And publishers, that’s all of us here,

00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:36.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the end is rapidly drawing near,

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s never been more important
to teach Bible truth

00:29:38.893 --> 00:29:42.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a simple, 
appealing, and motivating way.

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:47.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means life to those who listen to us.

00:29:47.702 --> 00:29:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because teaching is so important,

00:29:50.071 --> 00:29:52.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has motivated skilled teachers

00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pass on their methods to others.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:00.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, the Bible tells us
that Paul imparted to Timothy

00:30:00.582 --> 00:30:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only what to teach

00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:07.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also his methods,
or how to teach.

00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:11.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those methods, it says,
were valid everywhere

00:30:11.292 --> 00:30:13.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every congregation,

00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so Timothy passed
those methods on to others.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:19.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jehovah’s organization

00:30:19.834 --> 00:30:22.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has endeavored
to follow the same pattern.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teaching teachers has a long history

00:30:26.508 --> 00:30:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:30:28.776 --> 00:30:30.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at some modern examples

00:30:30.812 --> 00:30:34.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how Jehovah has trained us to be teachers.

00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:37.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1922, The School of the Prophets

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was used by some groups of Bible students

00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:44.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop the art
of public teaching and speaking.

00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:46.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One suggestion in the booklet

00:30:46.027 --> 00:30:49.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to practice a figure-eight gesture,

00:30:49.531 --> 00:30:52.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, so that speakers would learn

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move their arms and hands in curves.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:31:00.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those schools were later discontinued.

00:31:01.976 --> 00:31:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nineteen forty-two

00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:06.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even before the Theocratic Ministry School

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was introduced to the congregations—

00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:11.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a series of articles in Consolation magazine

00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:14.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appeared until 1945 under the heading

00:31:14.522 --> 00:31:17.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Presenting ‘This Gospel of the Kingdom.’”

00:31:17.525 --> 00:31:20.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first article stated the series’ purpose.

00:31:20.828 --> 00:31:25.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “To give
helpful instruction and practical hints

00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:28.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to such ones as would publish God’s kingdom

00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:30.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after the example of Christ himself . . .

00:31:30.505 --> 00:31:33.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Study and apply this instruction,

00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:37.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note your improvement
as a Kingdom publisher.”

00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:39.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nineteen forty-three

00:31:39.347 --> 00:31:42.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the booklet Course in Theocratic Ministry

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
featured 52 lessons,

00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:46.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one for each week of the year,

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:49.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in conjunction with the newly formed

00:31:49.257 --> 00:31:51.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Theocratic Ministry School.

00:31:51.693 --> 00:31:53.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nineteen forty-five

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:57.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the book 
Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers

00:31:57.298 --> 00:32:01.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expanded that course to 90 lessons.

00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:03.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nineteen fifty-five

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:06.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the book Qualified to Be Ministers

00:32:06.107 --> 00:32:08.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was described in The Watchtower

00:32:08.343 --> 00:32:10.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the “best yet” book

00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:12.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Theocratic Ministry School

00:32:12.914 --> 00:32:16.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it was revised
into an even better qualified book

00:32:16.651 --> 00:32:19.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1967.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nineteen seventy-one

00:32:21.122 --> 00:32:24.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook
was released.

00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:28.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in 2002, we received

00:32:28.496 --> 00:32:31.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benefit From Theocratic
Ministry School Education,

00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:35.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included
new study points, exercises,

00:32:35.336 --> 00:32:37.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a counsel form right in the book.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, as needs change, Jehovah provides us

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:47.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with new tools to improve our teaching.

00:32:47.315 --> 00:32:52.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it time for a new tool
to improve our skills as teachers?

00:32:53.354 --> 00:32:57.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the following
regarding our Ministry School textbook:

00:32:57.458 --> 00:33:00.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Terminology:

00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:02.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The contents
and even the title of that book

00:33:02.964 --> 00:33:05.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refer to the Theocratic Ministry School,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that, as such, is no longer in place.

00:33:08.803 --> 00:33:11.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) Simplicity:

00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:15.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many find it difficult
to quickly find key ideas

00:33:15.443 --> 00:33:18.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book’s 53 study points.

00:33:18.312 --> 00:33:20.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An elder from Georgia, U.S.A., wrote,

00:33:20.982 --> 00:33:24.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the short time available
to direct the congregation

00:33:24.152 --> 00:33:26.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to specific locations in the book,

00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:29.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it makes it very difficult for the brothers

00:33:29.323 --> 00:33:32.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find where the chairman is.”

00:33:32.293 --> 00:33:35.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) Translation:

00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:37.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It isn’t easy
to translate a book this big.

00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in over 200 languages
around the globe,

00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:44.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
congregations have
the Meeting Workbook

00:33:44.172 --> 00:33:47.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but lack the Ministry School book.

00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:50.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For all of these reasons and more,

00:33:50.044 --> 00:33:52.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are pleased to announce a release

00:33:52.346 --> 00:33:54.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that addresses those concerns

00:33:54.816 --> 00:33:56.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that will help more
of God’s people

00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:58.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to improve their teaching.

00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:02.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a 28-page brochure entitled

00:34:02.223 --> 00:34:05.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apply Yourself to Reading and Teaching.

00:34:20.374 --> 00:34:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairman will let you know

00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:25.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you can access a copy
for your personal use

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no doubt in less than six months.

00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:34.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition, the instructions
 for Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting

00:34:34.222 --> 00:34:38.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be revised
and made available to the public.

00:34:38.126 --> 00:34:40.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this brochure will be used

00:34:40.428 --> 00:34:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our midweek meetings worldwide

00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:47.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning January 7, 2019.

00:34:47.535 --> 00:34:50.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t discard
your Ministry School book, though.

00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:53.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we won’t be using it
at our weekly meetings,

00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:56.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is still a very valuable reference.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know more about some

00:34:58.446 --> 00:35:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this new brochure’s features?

00:35:07.455 --> 00:35:09.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin with brevity.

00:35:09.824 --> 00:35:12.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are only 20 study points,

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:15.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and each study point is only one page long.

00:35:15.062 --> 00:35:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean important points
have been omitted?

00:35:17.932 --> 00:35:19.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:22.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many cases, similar points
have been combined.

00:35:22.336 --> 00:35:25.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
“Study 5—Accurate Reading,”

00:35:25.339 --> 00:35:27.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
incorporates key ideas from three points

00:35:27.909 --> 00:35:29.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Ministry School book.

00:35:29.911 --> 00:35:31.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are accurate reading,

00:35:31.879 --> 00:35:33.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
words clearly spoken,

00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:36.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and correct pronunciation.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, reading accurately
includes pronouncing

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each word correctly and clearly.

00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:43.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, and by the way,

00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:46.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brochure does not suggest
using that figure-eight gesture,

00:35:46.928 --> 00:35:48.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you don’t have to worry about that.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another feature is clarity.

00:35:50.932 --> 00:35:54.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each study features
two or three main points

00:35:54.168 --> 00:35:56.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with simple, direct instructions,

00:35:56.204 --> 00:36:00.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some study points
also include practical tips

00:36:00.107 --> 00:36:02.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that relate to the main point.

00:36:02.443 --> 00:36:04.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition, you will find

00:36:04.512 --> 00:36:06.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many of the study points

00:36:06.547 --> 00:36:09.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
include a box entitled “In the Ministry.”

00:36:09.483 --> 00:36:10.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:13.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because while most
of the points in the brochure

00:36:13.354 --> 00:36:17.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply both to the field ministry
and to teaching from the platform,

00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suggestions that are specific
to the field ministry

00:36:20.494 --> 00:36:23.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appear in this separate box.

00:36:23.631 --> 00:36:27.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next is a feature
that you will really find of interest:

00:36:27.768 --> 00:36:30.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Record Your Progress.”

00:36:30.004 --> 00:36:32.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the last pages
of the brochure

00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:36.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is for you to record the date
you consider each study point.

00:36:36.577 --> 00:36:38.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More about that in a moment.

00:36:38.646 --> 00:36:40.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are some features.

00:36:40.648 --> 00:36:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will the new brochure
address the three needs

00:36:43.684 --> 00:36:46.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we mentioned earlier,
namely terminology,

00:36:46.754 --> 00:36:49.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simplicity, and translation?

00:36:49.724 --> 00:36:52.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin with terminology.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brochure uses updated expressions,

00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:59.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it does not refer
to specific meetings or meeting parts.

00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, it will not need
to be frequently revised.

00:37:04.038 --> 00:37:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, simplicity: Fewer study points

00:37:08.209 --> 00:37:11.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a simple easy-to-use layout

00:37:11.412 --> 00:37:15.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will allow the chairman
to isolate main points quickly

00:37:15.249 --> 00:37:17.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will help the audience

00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:19.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to follow along closely 
with the chairman.

00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:23.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, and you elders
are going to love this,

00:37:23.624 --> 00:37:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more is being done
to simplify the work

00:37:26.227 --> 00:37:30.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the chairman
and the Life and Ministry Meeting overseer.

00:37:30.097 --> 00:37:33.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beginning January 7, 2019,

00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:37.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the instructions in the Meeting Workbook
for each student assignment

00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:41.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will include in parentheses
the specific study point

00:37:41.609 --> 00:37:43.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student should work on.

00:37:43.978 --> 00:37:47.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
for the week of January 7th,

00:37:47.448 --> 00:37:51.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all brothers worldwide
who are assigned the Bible reading

00:37:51.452 --> 00:37:55.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider
“Study 5—Accurate Reading.”

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought you would like that.

00:38:08.669 --> 00:38:11.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life and Ministry Meeting 
overseers and chairmen

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:14.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will no longer need to worry 
about assigning study points

00:38:14.408 --> 00:38:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or keeping track 
of what each student is working on.

00:38:17.111 --> 00:38:19.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see a chairman use

00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:21.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new brochure to assist a student?

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch.

00:38:30.758 --> 00:38:34.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . and Abednego over the administration 
of the province of Babylon,

00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:39.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Daniel served in the king’s court.”

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Gomez.

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:42.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an excellent reading.

00:38:42.036 --> 00:38:44.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were accurate, fluent,

00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:46.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we could tell that you prepared well.

00:38:46.374 --> 00:38:50.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were working 
on study point number 10, “Modulation.”

00:38:50.444 --> 00:38:53.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The summary tells us that we have 
two goals when modulating our voice.

00:38:54.315 --> 00:38:56.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One goal is to stir emotion.

00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:59.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stirred our emotions 
when you read Daniel 2:47:

00:39:00.388 --> 00:39:03.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Truly your God is a God of gods.”

00:39:03.624 --> 00:39:08.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By raising your pitch, you conveyed 
Nebuchadnezzar’s intensity and surprise.

00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the way to do it.

00:39:10.698 --> 00:39:15.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second goal is to convey ideas clearly.

00:39:15.036 --> 00:39:17.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way to do it is to increase our volume.

00:39:17.071 --> 00:39:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
what is the main point of verse 44?

00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:25.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it that Jehovah will set up a Kingdom?

00:39:25.312 --> 00:39:28.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So instead of emphasizing the word “kings,”

00:39:28.315 --> 00:39:32.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might increase your volume
when reading “God of heaven.”

00:39:32.153 --> 00:39:37.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the days of those kings 
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom.”

00:39:38.559 --> 00:39:41.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s something you might try
when preparing to read a scripture.

00:39:41.028 --> 00:39:43.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for the main point in each verse,

00:39:43.197 --> 00:39:47.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then try varying your pitch, pace,
or volume to make that idea stand out.

00:39:47.368 --> 00:39:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Gomez. Well done!

00:39:50.571 --> 00:39:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For our next part, we’ll consider . . .

00:40:00.548 --> 00:40:02.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very good example

00:40:02.616 --> 00:40:06.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of concise and helpful
one-minute comments

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and counsel by the chairman.

00:40:08.355 --> 00:40:10.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where does the chairman write

00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:13.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether the student
completed the assigned point?

00:40:13.227 --> 00:40:16.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t write anything.

00:40:16.197 --> 00:40:20.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the page
“Record Your Progress” mentioned earlier,

00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will write the dates
that the student considered each point?

00:40:23.237 --> 00:40:26.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The student, not the chairman.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When should a student
record a date on this page?

00:40:28.943 --> 00:40:31.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well that’s up to you, the student.

00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many will likely record the date

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are assigned 
to consider a specific point

00:40:35.783 --> 00:40:37.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a student assignment.

00:40:37.885 --> 00:40:40.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others, including elders,
who may not handle

00:40:40.921 --> 00:40:43.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
student assignments regularly,
may want to consider

00:40:43.824 --> 00:40:46.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of these points on their own.

00:40:46.227 --> 00:40:49.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each brother and sister
can decide when and how

00:40:49.063 --> 00:40:51.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use this page
to record their progress.

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:56.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This “Record Your Progress” page
is for your personal use.

00:40:56.003 --> 00:40:58.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, so far, we’ve looked at the need

00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:00.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for updated terminology
and greater simplicity.

00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:04.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
that third point: translation.

00:41:04.111 --> 00:41:06.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be thrilled to know
that the Governing Body

00:41:06.447 --> 00:41:08.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has already approved for this brochure

00:41:08.782 --> 00:41:12.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be translated
into over 350 languages

00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:14.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than twice
the number of languages

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that produce the current textbook.

00:41:17.158 --> 00:41:20.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the same brevity that allows us

00:41:20.161 --> 00:41:23.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to expand the translation also means

00:41:23.297 --> 00:41:26.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are few real-life examples
in the brochure

00:41:26.867 --> 00:41:29.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that show how to apply the study points.

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wouldn’t it be helpful to see
how to put the study points into action,

00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:37.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both from the platform
and in the field ministry?

00:41:37.411 --> 00:41:39.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed it would.

00:41:39.146 --> 00:41:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, the Governing Body
has approved the production of 20 videos

00:41:43.017 --> 00:41:45.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one for each study point—

00:41:45.052 --> 00:41:48.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to depict the application of these points.

00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:49.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the video

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:53.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “Study 1—Effective Introduction.”

00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:07.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re at the Kingdom Hall
about to give a public talk.

00:42:07.741 --> 00:42:11.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the audience listen
to what you have to say?

00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:16.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much depends on how
you introduce your subject.

00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:19.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An effective introduction arouses interest,

00:42:19.386 --> 00:42:21.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identifies your subject,

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shows why the subject
is important to your listeners.

00:42:26.227 --> 00:42:30.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give our brother
an opportunity to introduce his subject.

00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:34.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the meeting chairman mentioned,

00:42:34.935 --> 00:42:37.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to talk about death

00:42:37.204 --> 00:42:40.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what it means to you and me.

00:42:40.374 --> 00:42:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read a scripture

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:44.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ecclesiastes 9:5.

00:42:45.746 --> 00:42:48.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:51.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the speaker identify his subject?

00:42:51.252 --> 00:42:53.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:55.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he arouse interest?

00:42:55.256 --> 00:42:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so much.

00:42:57.258 --> 00:43:00.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he show why the subject is important?

00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:02.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:43:02.463 --> 00:43:05.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how might he approach
the subject differently?

00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:07.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:43:08.602 --> 00:43:10.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout all of human history,

00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one person has escaped death.

00:43:14.908 --> 00:43:17.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lives of some people
are cut short suddenly

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:20.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by unexpected events or illness.

00:43:21.582 --> 00:43:24.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever lost a loved one in death?

00:43:24.285 --> 00:43:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you know how painful that is.

00:43:27.788 --> 00:43:31.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet how can something
that causes so much pain

00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:34.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be a normal, natural part of life?

00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is the key

00:43:37.631 --> 00:43:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understanding why we die,

00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:42.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we go when we die,

00:43:42.636 --> 00:43:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how death will be reversed.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider each of those points.

00:43:49.843 --> 00:43:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can apply this principle

00:43:51.979 --> 00:43:54.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to any subject when giving a talk.

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:56.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you effectively introduce

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a subject in the ministry?

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:01.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, of course,
that in most cases

00:44:01.121 --> 00:44:03.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re a complete stranger
to the householder.

00:44:03.691 --> 00:44:05.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try not to startle the person.

00:44:05.826 --> 00:44:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Identify yourself early in the conversation.

00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:12.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To determine what
a person might be interested in,

00:44:12.499 --> 00:44:15.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe his activities or surroundings.

00:44:15.636 --> 00:44:18.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might begin by asking a question

00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or making a brief comment
about those things.

00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:23.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider one example.

00:44:27.648 --> 00:44:29.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, my name is Jill.

00:44:29.683 --> 00:44:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m here to talk
about God’s purpose for the future.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says here—

00:44:34.188 --> 00:44:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, but I don’t have time to talk.

00:44:39.993 --> 00:44:43.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was the introduction effective?

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:45.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The householder didn’t want
to continue the conversation,

00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:50.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so apparently the introduction
didn’t arouse interest.

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:54.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might the publisher
have handled the situation better?

00:44:58.212 --> 00:44:59.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a beautiful garden.

00:45:02.883 --> 00:45:05.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must take a lot of work.

00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:06.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sure does!

00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:09.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your work is certainly paying off.

00:45:09.223 --> 00:45:10.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:45:10.557 --> 00:45:13.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, my name is Jill,
and this is Tammy.

00:45:13.427 --> 00:45:15.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m Emily.

00:45:15.062 --> 00:45:19.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emily, you work so hard
to care for the garden you planted.

00:45:19.566 --> 00:45:22.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that God cares the same way

00:45:22.903 --> 00:45:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about this planet that he created?

00:45:27.775 --> 00:45:30.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the publisher took into account

00:45:30.043 --> 00:45:32.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the interests of the householder,

00:45:32.246 --> 00:45:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she increased the chances
of starting a conversation

00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:38.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sharing the Kingdom message.

00:45:38.118 --> 00:45:40.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can also be done in urban areas

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where people expect you
to get right to the point.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In such settings, try to include
a thought-provoking statement

00:45:46.894 --> 00:45:49.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or question in your introduction.

00:45:50.898 --> 00:45:53.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Effective introductions are the first step

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:56.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward productive conversations

00:45:56.136 --> 00:45:58.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and presentations of the good news.

00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:19.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold
that the ‘preaching of the good news

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Kingdom
will stop when the end comes.’

00:46:21.795 --> 00:46:24.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our work is urgent.

00:46:24.097 --> 00:46:27.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the work of teaching
has only just begun.

00:46:27.234 --> 00:46:30.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 26:9 says of Jehovah

00:46:30.537 --> 00:46:34.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “when there are judgments
from you for the earth,

00:46:34.241 --> 00:46:37.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the inhabitants of the land
learn about righteousness.”

00:46:37.578 --> 00:46:40.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will certainly prove
to be true in the new world.

00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:42.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The great crowd will soon be invited

00:46:42.783 --> 00:46:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach vast numbers
of resurrected ones.

00:46:45.853 --> 00:46:50.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may study with someone
who lived 3,000 years ago or more.

00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:53.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how helpful it will be

00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:56.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have learned
how to explain unfamiliar terms

00:46:56.463 --> 00:47:00.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in “Study 17—Understandable to Others.”

00:47:00.267 --> 00:47:02.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your student may have lived
during the Middle Ages

00:47:02.936 --> 00:47:05.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when people were taught
to fear the clergy

00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:07.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to love God.

00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:09.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you will have already
learned from Study 19

00:47:09.943 --> 00:47:12.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to “Reach the Heart” of your student.

00:47:12.346 --> 00:47:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re asked to summarize

00:47:14.381 --> 00:47:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that Jehovah did
for his people during the last days,

00:47:17.484 --> 00:47:19.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll need to keep things simple,

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:24.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something you learned
in “Study 14—Main Points Made to Stand Out.”

00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:28.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even today, however, we must be teachers.

00:47:28.328 --> 00:47:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So use this new brochure
to ‘continue applying yourself

00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reading and teaching.’

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing this, the Bible tells us:

00:47:35.536 --> 00:47:40.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will save both yourself
and those who listen to you.”

00:47:54.254 --> 00:47:56.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Cook,

00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:00.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thank you also
for joining us on the Governing Body.

00:48:00.561 --> 00:48:03.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To borrow words from Brother Sydlik:

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Lord knew we needed your help.”

00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:09.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m still working on that too.

00:48:11.371 --> 00:48:13.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have the following announcement

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding our wonderful new brochure

00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:20.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I double checked;
I got the right announcement this time:

00:48:20.514 --> 00:48:22.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Teaching brochure

00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:25.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all available languages

00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:28.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be released on jw.org,

00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:31.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™,

00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:33.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and JW Library®

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:38.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Monday October 8, 2018.

00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:42.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in addition to that,
if you will be making use

00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:44.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a hard copy of this publication,

00:48:44.905 --> 00:48:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one copy of the printed edition

00:48:47.641 --> 00:48:50.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be available after the program

00:48:50.444 --> 00:48:53.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the various annual meeting locations,

00:48:53.947 --> 00:48:57.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the main lobby of your complex

00:48:57.784 --> 00:49:01.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those watching from their personal rooms.

00:49:01.455 --> 00:49:03.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additional printed copies

00:49:03.523 --> 00:49:06.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be requested through the congregations.

00:49:06.793 --> 00:49:08.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Monday
—in two days—

00:49:08.895 --> 00:49:11.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you get this one electronically.

00:49:11.465 --> 00:49:14.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, moving to our next talk.

00:49:14.334 --> 00:49:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re privileged to listen

00:49:16.303 --> 00:49:18.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother Anthony Morris,

00:49:18.305 --> 00:49:23.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s going to deliver the gripping talk,

00:49:23.076 --> 00:49:26.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This Is It!”

00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:28.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope that I rendered justice

00:49:28.415 --> 00:49:30.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to announcing that title, Brother Morris.

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to you later on.

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:48.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It ruined my introduction, but that’s all right.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:53.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think all of you would agree

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:57.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much we enjoyed the museum video

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hearing Brother Fred Franz

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his voice—
talking about after the assassination

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the archduke
that the brothers said, ‘Aha!

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:10.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There it is!
There it is!

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:13.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’ve been waiting for.’

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s very stirring,

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:17.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we would have critics saying,

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:21.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Yeah, but you people had other expectations

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:25.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were not realized,’
and etcetera, you know.

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:28.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s amazing that even the world

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:33.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognized that this was unique—1914.

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:37.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See?
In fact, I’ve had this for many years.

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:38.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to show it to you.

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:41.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s The New World Magazine.

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was widely read at the time,

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:48.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I guess about 1931,
they went out of business.

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:53.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here, 
“End of All Kingdoms in 1914

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:56.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘Millennial Dawners’ 25 Year Prophecy,”

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
widely read; other newspapers covered it.

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:01.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made comments here:

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The terrific war outbreak in Europe

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:07.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy.

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:10.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a quarter of a century past,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through preachers and through press,

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the ‘International Bible Students,’
best known as ‘Millennial Dawners,’

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:19.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have been proclaiming
to the world that the Day of Wrath

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:23.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look out for 1914!’

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:30.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been the cry
of the hundreds of traveling evangelists.”

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciate very much how

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Yearbook in 1975

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:37.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
considering our modern-day history

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made this beautiful quote:

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Disappointments about going to heaven

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:46.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in 1914 really were very minor,

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:49.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“compared with the great expectations realized

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection with that year.”

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s amazing.

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:55.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the first six months
of 1914, nothing happened.

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were being ridiculed.

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:01.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the archduke is assassinated.

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:04.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one was particularly released

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:06.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on August 30, 1914.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:11.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions died in World War I.

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:14.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s Brother Franz’s statement

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:18.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really gave
the idea for the theme here:

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This Is It!”

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question arises, Will we have

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one or more times
—in the future or even now—

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we can say, “This is it”

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have that same exciting fervor

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of Bible prophecy?

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:39.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s begin with this one here.

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:44.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Daniel chapter 11,

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 11.

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:54.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to read here verse 40,

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:57.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or half of it:

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:02.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the time of the end the king of the south

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(here at Daniel 11:40)
will engage with him in a pushing.”

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Governing Body

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:17.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been prayerfully considering recent events.

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that in 1991,

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union came to an end.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who is “the king of the north”?

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after prayerfully considering it

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:33.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the matter of the pushing,

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:38.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re assuring you that what we see,

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:41.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after prayerfully considering it,
is that it’s Russia

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its allies
—the king of the north.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:46.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s some reasoning.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Soviet Union disbanded;

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:52.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia came up from the rubble

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Soviet Union, along with its allies.

00:53:56.666 --> 00:54:00.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here are some of the facts.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things have become apparent.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia and its allies
are continuing to engage

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:09.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a pushing with the king of the south.

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:13.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll get to that “pushing” point shortly.

00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:16.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second, they are taking the lead

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:20.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in persecuting and opposing God’s people.

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:23.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what the pushing includes:

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
electronic espionage,

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:29.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
computer attacks,

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:31.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trade wars

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that’s what they call them),

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:37.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hostile flooding
into surrounding territory.

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:40.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are recurring features
of the news headlines.

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re aware of them.

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So someone asks if the king
of the north has been inactive.

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:47.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:50.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It appears he’s never been this busy

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with pushing the king of the south.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is it!

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:58.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, we’re confident
to share with you that Russia

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:01.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its allies are the king of the north,

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:04.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re engaged in this pushing.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, last month,
they had the largest war games

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Russia did—
since the Soviet Union

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was in existence way back in the ’80’s.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:17.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they had their allies
with them in the war game.

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re confident this is it.

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the king of the north,

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:26.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what’s involved at this time

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:29.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the pushing—
locking horns with each other.

00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:32.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is there going to be another time

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
related to Bible prophecy
where the faithful slave

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be able to say to you, “This is it”?

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:42.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one that we’re all very familiar with

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:46.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and especially
this audience here in Newburgh,

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve been in the truth for decades—

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:52.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the very familiar thoughts

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:56.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:59.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 2

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 3,

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
5:2, 3:
“For you yourselves know very well

00:56:06.996 --> 00:56:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:12.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as a thief in the night.

00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:18.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:21.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:24.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:27.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:32.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, so that we have clear thinking

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:36.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the published comments regarding

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these two verses
that we read, we’ll take you back

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:41.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the September 15, 2012, Watchtower:

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:46.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As used here, ‘Jehovah’s day’

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:50.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“refers to the period
that will start with the destruction

00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of false religion and will culminate

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:55.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the war of Armageddon.

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:59.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, just before
that day of Jehovah begins,

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“world leaders will be saying,
‘Peace and security!’

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:06.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This may refer to one event

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:09.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or to a series of events.

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nations may think they are close

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to solving some of their big problems.”

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:19.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s the question, and it’s understood

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:21.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would be asked,

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the faithful slave
be able to at a certain time

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:27.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
say to the brotherhood: “This is it!

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what we’ve been waiting for.

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the ‘peace and security’ prophecy”?

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:39.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, keep this comment in mind

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from The Watchtower, 2004,
February 1, page 21:

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since Bible prophecies
are often fully understood

00:57:49.399 --> 00:57:51.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“only after they are fulfilled

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or are in the process of fulfillment . . .”

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that interesting?

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep that in mind.

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:02.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll come back to it,
and that happens

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:04.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the case when
the prophecy is fulfilled.

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, OK.”

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, see, we’ll come back

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to that statement
from The Watchtower shortly.

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just consider
(especially those of you here,

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of you are aged,

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:20.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll remember,

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of you who were
in the truth at the time),

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the year 1986?

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The United Nations

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:30.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was proclaiming prior

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to January of 1986 that,

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, ‘Get ready.’

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:39.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted
the governments to put their arms down

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:42.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for at least a year,
the International Year of Peace.

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you were in the truth back then,
you were like, “OK.”

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they were all big.

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the pope at that time

00:58:53.596 --> 00:58:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gathered all these religious leaders

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over there to Assisi, Italy,

00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were all over there
praying to who they pray to

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having this fervor

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for peace for the earth.

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how did
the faithful slave handle all that?

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:17.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this honors
Jehovah’s faithful slave serving at that time.

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what was published
in the ’85 Watchtower,

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:22.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
October 1, page 18.

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is some months
before that all started in 1986.

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:29.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what was stated:

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christians cannot say in advance exactly

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:37.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when the great tribulation will strike.
(Period.)

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah has not revealed
‘that day or the hour.’

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thus when, for example, the United Nations

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares the year 1986

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an ‘International Year of Peace,’

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christians watch the event with interest.

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:54.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But they cannot say in advance

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:58.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether this will prove
to be the fulfillment of Paul’s words.”

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonetheless, we kept on the watch,

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:03.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God’s spirit was guiding his people,

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly the faithful slave.

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were not only faithful,
they were discreet.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they did not say:
“This is it!

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the fulfillment

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.”
No.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you are still there,

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:22.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just something to keep in mind here—

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:29.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes we’ll read
verses 2 and 3 and leave out verse 4.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He writes: “But you, brothers,

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:37.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you are not in darkness,

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the day should overtake
you as it would thieves.”

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:43.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thieves are doing their thievery

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it’s dark, but we’re sons of light.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:49.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s not going to catch us,

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:52.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faithful ones worshipping the true God,

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:56.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obedient to this
earthly part of his organization.

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up—

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:01.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go back to that quote

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the 2004 Watchtower,

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Prophecies are only fully understood
only after they are fulfilled,’

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:12.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also said, ‘or are in the process

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of fulfillment.’

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:18.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faithful slave be able to say

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the process of the fulfillment

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this prophecy from 1 Thessalonians:
“This is it!

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:32.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we’ve been waiting for”?

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll have to wait and see.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:39.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s a word of caution here

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to pass on to you
because we’re all human.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:48.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must keep on the watch,
but please, just don’t be gullible.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:51.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You hear a world leader
say something about peace.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you
start e-mailing or something else

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a social network.

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is it!”

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:05.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave the channel to handle such matters.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:08.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the faithful slave is moved by God’s spirit

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:11.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to say that to the brotherhood,

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s His will, fine.

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But please don’t be gullible.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stick with the way
Jehovah wants this to operate,

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’ll bless your obedience.

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll remember
Jehovah’s day begins

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:28.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they’re saying,
“Peace and security!”

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:31.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Revelation chapter 17.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, what stirring words!

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:38.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are familiar,
but it does nourish our figurative hearts

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:42.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we read these,

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 17,

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 15, 16, and 17:

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:52.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to me: ‘The waters
that you saw, where the prostitute

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘(the world empire of false religion) is sitting,

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘mean peoples and crowds
and nations and tongues.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:01.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And the ten horns
that you saw and the wild beast,

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘these will hate the prostitute

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and will make her devastated and naked,

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will eat up her flesh
and completely burn her with fire.

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For God put it
into their hearts to carry out his thought,

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘yes, to carry out their one thought

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the words of God
will have been accomplished.’”

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:25.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is what’s going to happen.

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think about it,
this is just mind-boggling.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have no plans as such

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the governments—
at this point.

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah forces

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:41.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one part of Satan’s system

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:44.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy another part.

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:47.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the Almighty God can do that.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when they do destroy Babylon the Great

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:55.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of this is taking place on the earth,

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:59.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you brothers are not going
to need a breaking news update.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the globe you’re going to say:

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is it!

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:09.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The great tribulation has started.”

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, frankly,

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:14.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who worry sometimes,

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the great tribulation
as these events unfold,

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:22.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

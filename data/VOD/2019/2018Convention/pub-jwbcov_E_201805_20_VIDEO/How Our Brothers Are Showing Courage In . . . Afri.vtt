00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:05.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I came into the truth,
my life was difficult!

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were many women with one husband.

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My child had died.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:16.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got the truth through one older sister.

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She helped me understand
what happens to people that die,

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including my son.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started attending the book study
and came into the truth.

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the course of the study,

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that to really serve Jehovah,

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you cannot be part of a polygamous marriage.

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I told him: “Staying in this situation
is not in line with Jehovah’s way.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have to leave.

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You already had a wife
when I came to your house.”

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he said: “How can you talk about leaving

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when you are pregnant with my child?

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole family needs to be involved in this.”

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family said,
“You have to call a village meeting.”

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they called everyone together.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody was upset with me.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:02.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said: “But no one has done this before.

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are the first.”

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said: “It is not bad.

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to serve God.”

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gossiped a lot about me.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said: “You are leaving,
but you’ll come back.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can’t make it on your own.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just forget about her.”

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I was leaving that day,
I couldn’t stop crying.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:26.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since my family shunned me,
keeping in mind Joshua 24:15, I said,

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Me and my children will serve Jehovah,

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah will be with me wherever I go.”

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only packed a few personal items that I had.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left everything that was in the house.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left everything with them.

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were affected by the war
because while I was running away,

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:54.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of my children got sick
in my hands and died on the road.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a basket for fishing that I bought.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When fishing, I would sell some.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever I didn’t sell, we ate.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I would ask my daughter,

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are so poor, Zogbo,
don’t you want to go back to the village?”

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said: “Mama, I can’t go back.

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:14.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to serve Jehovah too.”

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed me.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter, Zogbo,
got baptized and later served at Bethel.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:24.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also blessed me when I got married.

00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:28.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our son is now an unbaptized publisher,
and my husband is an elder.

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:34.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:1
helped me to improve my conduct.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped my first husband
to serve Jehovah too.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no regrets.

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am now happy with my decision.

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tell Jehovah, “Thank you!”

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:46.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why no matter what it takes,

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:48.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to miss meetings.

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:52.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always want to attend meetings
with my brothers and sisters

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:55.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can encourage one another.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I accepted the truth before my husband.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His family members opposed me

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I helped
my husband to become a Witness.

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:15.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why they never came
to our aid when he was sick.

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My children and I took care
of him on our own until his death.

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chief asked me
to perform some funeral rites.

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:27.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained that
I could not perform those rites,

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:32.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the chief banished me
from the town along with my family.

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:37.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I informed the elders,
and they consulted the branch.

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The case was reported to the police.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Tuesday morning,

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:51.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we heard a lot of noise coming
from town but did not know why.

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, the noise got louder coming toward us.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the commotion reached us,
my sister-in-law approached first,

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:05.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beating a tray with wood.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:12.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She then told me to my face:
“Agnes, you have caused disgrace!

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have never heard
anything like this before.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Disgrace!”

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:19.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon thereafter, we heard a knock, knock.

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:21.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two policemen had arrived.

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t flee from the situation
because my fellow worshippers

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would face the same issue in the future.

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:35.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, I decided to stay
and face it until the case was resolved.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our case was called up,

00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family members and I were present.

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:43.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was allowed to tell

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:46.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my version of the matter, which I did.

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:49.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The inspector warned the chief seriously,

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:53.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminding him that this matter
is about an individual’s human rights.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chief responded,

00:04:56.942 --> 00:05:01.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“OK, then she should not
exchange greetings with me until my death.”

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked the officers
and the chief for resolving the matter.

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped me
to stand firm during the persecution

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was regular Bible reading,

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:15.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regularly attending Christian meetings,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and completely relying on Jehovah.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are not many
in the congregation who stay in town.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have brothers
from surrounding villages who,

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:29.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they come to the meetings in town,

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to visit and encourage me
after the meetings.

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah said
that “they will certainly fight against you,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they will not prevail against you,
for ‘I am with you.’”

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since Jehovah was on my side,
when they fought against me,

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they did not prevail.

00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:52.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help, they did not prevail.

Animated videos,

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like those in the series
Become Jehovah’s Friend,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been helping young ones
draw closer to their heavenly Father

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for several years now.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:20.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, Mom, I’m rejoicing in the hope!

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wee!

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you know

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:29.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what you see on the screen

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might last just a few short minutes

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it may involve weeks of work

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a virtual army of volunteers?

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With so much time and expense
involved in making an animated video,

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of careful planning
is required to avoid waste

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep
the process running smoothly.

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:56.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look at how the effective use

00:00:56.577 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of preproduction tools
help all of these brothers and sisters

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work together to take a video

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from initial concept to final production.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the direction of the Teaching Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work begins
long before the artists even get started.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They provide direction
on the theme that needs to be taught.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Members of the animation team collaborate

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop the featured characters
as well as plot structure,

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they work closely
with writers and storyboard artists

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop the approved idea
into a story line.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once a complete script is ready,

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the whole team
gathers together for a table read.

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:45.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the first time the team
hears the whole script being read aloud.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dialogue is meant to be heard.

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we read it aloud at the table read,

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:50.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we pick up on things

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we didn’t see in the written script.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re able to tighten the story

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it as clear as possible.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The script is reviewed
by the research team for accuracy.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it’s revised, polished, and submitted

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Teaching Committee for approval.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:08.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With an approved script in hand,

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the director then works with an artist

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:15.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start turning words into pictures

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:18.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—visualizing each scene on a storyboard.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First come the rough boards,

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing what will be included in each shot.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to the animation world, really,

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:27.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything you see on screen

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:30.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to be designed and created

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the characters, the furniture, the props, 

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the environment
are all created by a designer.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:39.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The storyboard really helps us

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
figure out exactly what we need to create

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re not creating
too much or too little.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once approved by the director,

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the storyboard artist
cleans up each of the boards.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preliminary recordings of dialogue, music,

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sound effects are added.

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are then used by the director

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and compositor to create an animatic.

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An animatic
is a rough draft of the entire video.

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The animatic is very important for us.

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:17.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way the director

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:19.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, more importantly, the Teaching Committee

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:22.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can see the entire video
before we are actually making it.

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that they can review it
and give us the proper direction.

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The finished animatic is submitted

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Teaching Committee for review.

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on direction from the committee,

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the team makes sure
that the teaching points come across clearly

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the finished product
is true to the spirit

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and intent
of the approved concept for the video.

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, using the approved
animatic as a blueprint,

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full production begins.

00:03:56.548 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, everything in animation
can be very time-consuming.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:05.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An animator working full-time here at Bethel

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be able to produce
four to six seconds of animation in one week,

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that doesn’t even include other aspects

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:14.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are very important, such as modeling,

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:18.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rigging, lighting,
compositing, and many others.

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the examples shown here,

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can see
just how closely the final version

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:29.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the video Make Jehovah Happy
follows the animatic.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preproduction tools
such as storyboards and animatics

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do more than save
the organization time and money.

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:42.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They enable the Teaching Committee

00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:46.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carefully evaluate
every project along the way

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the initial approved concept

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:50.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the final product

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to keep providing videos

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help all of us
honor our Friend, Jehovah.

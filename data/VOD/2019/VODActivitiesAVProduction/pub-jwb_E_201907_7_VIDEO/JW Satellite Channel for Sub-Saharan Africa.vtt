Some of the electronic information

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been translated and provided

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:10.865 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the brothers in sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:12.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was essentially unavailable to them.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many areas in Mozambique

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.038 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that do not have Internet access,

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:19.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and in some parts

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.375 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there is no cell phone coverage.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.377 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we started investigating

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.338 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what it would take to have a 24-hour-a-day,

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
7-day-a-week satellite channel

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dedicated to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:34.179 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When the announcement was made to our congregation

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.181 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the JW satellite channel,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters
were very happy about the announcement.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:43.314 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our organization has a lot of experience

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
distributing video via the Internet,

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:48.110 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but to distribute it on the satellite was entirely new,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we had to do a lot of research.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:52.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have our own satellite up in space.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rent a channel on a satellite
that covers sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.539 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What is required from the brothers is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a satellite dish and a decoder.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will allow them
to view the channel with no additional cost.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brothers that are invited

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:17.890 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to come here are trained.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, how to set up the dish.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, how to set up the decoder

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn how to adjust the dish properly

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:28.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it works well.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we teach them how to record the programs

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the goal that they can watch it
with the brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.620 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our satellite channel is set up to transmit

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.665 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one video track and 16 audio tracks.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives us the ability to broadcast our videos

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 16 languages.

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We consulted with
the Translation Services Department,

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so these are the 16 languages

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that give us the greatest audience
of our brothers in Africa.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:01.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wrote new software that takes
any new video that comes to JW Broadcasting®

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mixes the 16 languages
of video together into a single video file

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and delivers that to our satellite provider.

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lovingly approved
for the rental cost of the satellite channel

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be covered
from contributions to the worldwide work.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no expense to the brothers

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Africa to receive the program.

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We broadcast over

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a single satellite channel for most of our needs.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But occasionally, we use a second channel

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we broadcast live events, like conventions

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or branch visits.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the representative
from world headquarters gives his talk

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:39.805 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from Bethel, it is transmitted to us

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.015 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
live through the satellite.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This makes us feel like we

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.351 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are right there at Bethel.

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:45.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are very happy.

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:47.771 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The most recent live event

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.399 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we broadcasted originated in France.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the release of the revised edition
of the New World Translation,

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so this was very exciting.

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:59.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers and sisters 
that attended conventions

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ten different branch territories in Africa

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to tie in
to this broadcast that originated in France,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using the satellite.

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our branch territory,

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are arranging
for all new or remodeled Kingdom Halls

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have satellite equipment
as part of the standard audio/video package.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were very happy

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.474 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when we received the satellite dish

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:25.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because we could see that now

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are really close 
to the brothers on the Governing Body.

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:31.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The satellite channel is excellent!

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:34.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This provision touches our hearts.

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:38.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The deaf all over the country
benefited from the special talk

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it was interpreted
into Malawian Sign Language,

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing that Jehovah truly loves deaf people.

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:47.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this helps us
to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope and pray
that access to the JW satellite feed

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becomes available
to as many of our brothers and sisters

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as possible in sub-Saharan Africa.

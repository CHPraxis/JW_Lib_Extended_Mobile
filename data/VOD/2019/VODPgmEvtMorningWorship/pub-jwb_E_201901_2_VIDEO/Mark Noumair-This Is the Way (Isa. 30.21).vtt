00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:03.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah was God’s prophet

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.622 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for some 46 turbulent years.

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing what he saw.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual condition

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:10.927 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of that nation was deplorable,

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but Isaiah never gave up

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in wanting to help his people.

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have broken his heart
to see the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:23.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
destroyed
by the Assyrians in 740 B.C.E.

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Isaiah said early in his career

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he said:

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here I am! Send me!”

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he never turned his back
on that commission.

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Isaiah’s words fall on deaf ears

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wanted to help ones
to walk in Jehovah’s way?

00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is the way.’

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, obviously not.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were some who responded,

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though he might have thought
that his best years were behind him.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Hezekiah?

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hezekiah took those words seriously,

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to put his heart
into serving Jehovah God,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had a great influence on the nation.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was Hezekiah.

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it must have made
Isaiah’s heart rejoice

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his words were taken to heart

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by some individuals like Hezekiah.

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are others.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:10.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles
to 2 Chronicles chapter 34

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:13.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Chronicles chapter 34—

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:16.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note others
who really put their heart

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:19.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into serving Jehovah God to say: 
“This is the way. Walk in it.”

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:23.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words of Isaiah
would resonate in the ears of some.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example in chapter 34,

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah was eight years old
when he became king.

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a young boy Josiah was.

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:38.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year was 659 B.C.E.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:40.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here in verse 2, it says:

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He did what was right
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He walked in the ways of David.

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:47.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t deviate 
to the right or to the left.’

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:50.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did Josiah get this zeal

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to want to serve Jehovah
even at a young age?

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wouldn’t have been
from his father.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
His father, Amon, was wicked.

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But perhaps his grandfather, Manasseh?

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Manasseh died
when Josiah was six years old.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can imagine now
this repentant Manasseh

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking that little grandboy,
putting him on his knee,

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:14.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping him
to understand about Jehovah God.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t make the mistakes 
that I’ve made.’

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have loved his grandpa

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and at six years old.

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:24.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he’s eight years old,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he starts to serve Jehovah

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with zeal appropriate for that age.

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:31.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s interesting

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when Josiah
was eight years old in 659 B.C.E.,

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nebuchadnezzar 
was about five years old.

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Josiah becomes this king 
full of compassion; he loved people.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nebuchadnezzar 
becomes a king of cruelty

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually does damage 
to the nation of Israel and, of course,

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah’s son Zedekiah,
who he ends up blinding.

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:57.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah
—so different from others.

00:02:57.293 --> 00:03:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look in verse 3.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:04.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the eighth year
of his reign (that is Josiah),

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s now 15 years old;
he’s still a boy.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He starts to search
for the true God.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now
in the 12th year of his reign,

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s even cleansing Judah.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a campaign against idolatry.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s 19 years old,

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:22.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sweeps through with zeal
—at 19 years old.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is the way. Walk in it.’

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:28.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going back to that theme
“This is the way.”

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy and grateful
Josiah must have been

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:36.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when someone else comes to Jerusalem
by the name of Jeremiah.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah comes in
about 648-647 B.C.E.,

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re about the same age.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah is 19;
Jeremiah is in his early 20’s.

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a team!

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:49.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They become friends;
they love each other.

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:53.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a duo as they
continue to help God’s people

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk in the way!

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:58.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like a stereo system
—both of them.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:03.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look in verse 31,

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just picture
what’s happening here in Jerusalem

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:08.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Josiah and with Jeremiah.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 31
—there’s Josiah helping ones

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep God’s commandments,
reading the Law that he found

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:19.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the book of the Law in their ears

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—reading it, 
helping them to walk in the way.

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:26.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 31 says

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Josiah ‘would follow Jehovah,

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:30.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘keep his commandments,
his reminders,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and his regulations
with all his heart,

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all his soul,
carry out those words.’

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can just sense
that Josiah’s feelings

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:42.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were just bleeding
through these pages

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his love for Jehovah God

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanting ones 
to walk in the way of Jehovah.

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:52.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there you have Josiah; 
you have Jeremiah.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderful to see.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as the years roll on,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would Josiah take note 
of a young Judean boy

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the royal court 
by the name of Daniel?

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel would have been young,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but perhaps he put his eye
on Daniel and said,

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:13.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This boy
—he has a bright future in Jehovah’s service.’

00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Josiah wouldn’t live to see
Daniel’s accomplishments in due time.

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s still interesting.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is the way. Walk in it.’

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Individuals responded to that from Isaiah.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did not fall on deaf ears.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go a little bit further.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the year is 617 B.C.E.,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have Daniel, Hananiah,

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mishael, Azariah, Ezekiel

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all individuals
who responded to Jehovah’s Word.

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think about

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they had to take 
the words of Isaiah

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take the words of Jeremiah
—these boys—

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really apply it to their lives

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and under their circumstances,
we’re very proud of them.

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
now Josiah is dead,

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his sons
and grandson begin to reign.

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have wicked kings.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:14.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from the boyhood
of Daniel to his teens,

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he witnessed their conduct
—bad conduct at the nation’s highest levels.

00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:22.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoahaz: 23 years old, wicked;

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoiakim: 25 years old, wicked;

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:27.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoiachin: 18 years old, wicked;

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zedekiah: 21 years old, wicked
—bad kings.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these boys watching this?

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are their names:
Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, Zedekiah;

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they have nicknames:

00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:43.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest, and Stupid.

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet Daniel
would not be influenced

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their bad conduct.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:52.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing to imagine
what these boys were able to do

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how their faith remained intact.

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They walked in Jehovah’s ways.

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:59.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They resolved in their heart,
especially Daniel,

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be loyal to Jehovah God.

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To what extent?

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 14:14

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:11.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in Ezekiel 14:14

00:07:11.547 --> 00:07:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are these amazing words

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Ezekiel,

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:19.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five years after Daniel
comes to Babylon,

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
writes these words.

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Daniel is now in his early 20’s;

00:07:24.393 --> 00:07:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel is about 30 years old.

00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:28.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Daniel’s older brother,

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can imagine how proud
Ezekiel would have been

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to write these words about Daniel
—no jealousy.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I love that boy.
He’s like my little brother.’

00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he says:
‘If Noah and Daniel and Job were here,

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘you see, they would save themselves
because of their righteous conduct.’

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:48.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel was amazing

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:51.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be sandwiched
between Job and Noah

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:53.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at such a young age.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the type of man
we’re talking about.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we bring it up?

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We bring it up

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have many 
Daniel-like brothers and sisters

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right in our Bethel family here.

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:08.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young brothers and sisters

00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have determined in their hearts

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prove the Devil a liar,

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:14.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take advantage of their youth,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show Jehovah 
how loyal they want to be

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:19.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the depth of their devotion.

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:22.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to commend
these young brothers and sisters

00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Daniel-like ones.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot legislate

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love of God for you;

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cannot legislate

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:35.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you use
your electronic devices;

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:36.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cannot legislate

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you watch
on television and movies.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot do that.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot tell you
to put a firewall up for your computer.

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:47.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can get around all that.
You’re smart.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your “firewall” is your love
for Jehovah God

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your depth
of devotion for him.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what we’re saying:
“Thank you for using

00:08:55.818 --> 00:08:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your free will like Daniel
to honor Jehovah God.

00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:01.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep it up.”

00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:03.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about our older ones?

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel continued to serve Jehovah
up until about 100 years old.

00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:09.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up.

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped him?

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:14.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His prayers to Jehovah God.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer was the bedrock of his faith.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So older Daniel-like members
of our family

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:23.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have served Jehovah
for decades,

00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your loyalty
is so deeply appreciated.

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s your prayers
that have caused you

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—day in and day out,
week in and week out,

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
month in and month out
—to continue to serve Jehovah.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as Daniel and Isaiah

00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:39.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jeremiah and Josiah

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a positive impact
on the people of their day,

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let me reassure you

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you older brothers
and sisters, you mature ones—

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your loyalty and determination
to walk in Jehovah’s way for decades

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has deeply influenced our Bethel family.

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:58.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your determination
never to betray your God

00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has touched us personally,

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for this we say, “Thank you.”

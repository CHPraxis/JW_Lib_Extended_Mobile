00:00:01 A brother feels guilty
00:00:03 because he did things before his baptism.
00:00:06 A parent feels guilty
00:00:08 because his children left the truth.
00:00:11 A sister feels guilty
00:00:13 because she divorced her unfaithful husband.
00:00:16 What do all these people have in common?
00:00:19 They suffer from inappropriate guilt.
00:00:23 Now, a comedian joked,
00:00:25 “Religion is basically guilt with different holidays.”
00:00:29 Why is it that religious people carry so much guilt?
00:00:33 And can anything good come from it?
00:00:36 The Bible, of course, associates guilt
00:00:40 with laws, sin, and transgression.
00:00:43 Open your Bibles with me to Galatians 3:19,
00:00:48 and notice the effect the Mosaic Law had on the Israelites.
00:00:54 Paul says: “Why, then, the Law?
00:00:58 It was added to make transgressions manifest.”
00:01:02 So the Law reminded God’s people every day
00:01:06 that they were sinners.
00:01:08 Jehovah’s Law was perfect.
00:01:09 No one could live up to it.
00:01:11 So for the Israelites, feeling guilty was inescapable.
00:01:16 Now, why would Jehovah do that?
00:01:18 Why give them the Law to make them feel guilty?
00:01:22 Well, there were at least three reasons.
00:01:25 First, we should feel guilty when we’ve done something wrong.
00:01:29 It reminds us of Jehovah’s position as Universal Sovereign
00:01:34 and of his righteous standards,
00:01:36 and it confirms that our conscience is working.
00:01:40 Second, we can all admit that there are times
00:01:44 when we may not have done something wrong yet,
00:01:48 but we may be wanting to
00:01:51 and, at that point, guilt is our friend.
00:01:54 In some ways, it’s like physical pain.
00:01:57 Physical pain makes us aware of a potential health problem,
00:02:01 and the emotional pain of guilt alerts us to the fact
00:02:06 that there may be potential moral or spiritual problems.
00:02:10 And finally, third, when someone confesses his guilt,
00:02:15 it helps both the wrongdoer and the victim.
00:02:18 Confession brings the guilty person relief through forgiveness,
00:02:23 and it makes the victim feel better
00:02:25 when he sees that the guilty one loves them enough to apologize.
00:02:30 Unfortunately,
00:02:33 we can feel guilty even without being guilty.
00:02:38 And inappropriate guilt often leads people
00:02:41 to emotional distress and sometimes even harsh self-criticism.
00:02:46 So let’s consider three situations
00:02:49 where inappropriate guilt can paralyze us
00:02:52 and also what we can do to get rid of it.
00:02:55 The first situation is what we might call “persistent guilt.”
00:03:00 This is guilt for something you did and repented over
00:03:05 —even received forgiveness for—
00:03:07 but you can’t forgive yourself.
00:03:10 So you continue to ruminate over the matter,
00:03:13 and it saps your joy and strength.
00:03:15 What can you do?
00:03:17 Well, consider the apostle Paul.
00:03:20 There were times when the things he did in the past upset him.
00:03:25 How did he handle those feelings?
00:03:28 To answer, let’s read together
00:03:30 1 Corinthians 15:9, 10.
00:03:35 As we know,
00:03:38 Paul (before he was baptized) persecuted Christ’s brothers.
00:03:43 He even supported the stoning of Stephen.
00:03:46 How do you think those memories made him feel?
00:03:49 Well, notice what he says in verse 9:
00:03:53 “For I am the least of the apostles,
00:03:56 “and I am not worthy of being called an apostle,
00:03:59 because I persecuted the congregation of God.”
00:04:04 Now, when you’re in a position of responsibility like Paul was,
00:04:09 feelings of unworthiness like this can be devastating.
00:04:13 Satan tries to make you doubt yourself
00:04:17 —whether you still have God’s approval in your life.
00:04:20 And he often does this when you’re most vulnerable
00:04:24 —when you’re already crushed under the weight
00:04:26 of your own failures and disappointments.
00:04:30 But Paul didn’t let these feelings defeat him.
00:04:34 He didn’t give in to the pressure.
00:04:36 Notice what he says next in verse 10:
00:04:40 “But by God’s undeserved kindness I am what I am.
00:04:45 “And his undeserved kindness to me was not in vain,
00:04:49 “but I labored more than all of them;
00:04:51 “yet it was not I,
00:04:54 but the undeserved kindness of God that is with me.”
00:04:57 So Paul realized
00:05:00 that Jehovah accepted him for what he was,
00:05:03 and he knew that he couldn’t change whatever happened in the past,
00:05:07 no matter how much he might want to.
00:05:10 He accepted God’s undeserved kindness,
00:05:14 and he let Jehovah use him.
00:05:16 Well, like Paul, we’ve repented over our past sins.
00:05:20 We’ve confessed them to the extent necessary.
00:05:24 So we can be sure, too,
00:05:26 that Jehovah will be merciful with us.
00:05:29 Why?
00:05:30 Because Jehovah promises that he forgives in a large way.
00:05:35 So we can take him at his word and accept his forgiveness.
00:05:40 Now, we might refer to a second situation
00:05:44 that makes people suffer as “compassion guilt.”
00:05:48 This is feeling guilty
00:05:51 because you didn’t do enough to help someone.
00:05:55 And caregivers often struggle with feelings like this.
00:05:59 Even when they’re doing all they can to help,
00:06:03 they sometimes feel guilty about not being able to do more.
00:06:06 One sister who was caring for her elderly parents said,
00:06:11 “Having to say ‘I can’t take care of you anymore’
00:06:16 is extremely difficult.”
00:06:19 What can help those in this situation?
00:06:23 Well, notice what Ecclesiastes 7:16 says
00:06:28 we should all avoid:
00:06:31 “Do not be overly righteous,
00:06:34 “nor show yourself excessively wise.
00:06:37 Why should you bring ruin to yourself?”
00:06:42 Another way we could put this is:
00:06:45 Avoid becoming a perfectionist.
00:06:49 Conscientiousness can easily deteriorate into perfectionism.
00:06:54 If we’re trying to do more than we want to,
00:06:57 can do, or even should do,
00:07:00 then we’re only setting ourselves up
00:07:03 for disappointment and failure.
00:07:05 To illustrate, some people see caregiving
00:07:10 as a way to repay their parents for all they did while they were growing up.
00:07:15 But if we see it that way,
00:07:18 we’re always going to feel guilty
00:07:20 because we can never fully repay our parents.
00:07:24 Acting out of guilt will only drain us over time
00:07:28 and make us less effective as a caregiver.
00:07:32 What can we do instead?
00:07:34 We can share the load.
00:07:36 Family, friends, neighbors, and professionals can be of help.
00:07:41 But we have to ask for help,
00:07:44 and we have to ask directly for it.
00:07:47 Hints seldom work.
00:07:49 It may surprise us who and how many
00:07:54 are willing to pitch in if we make our needs known.
00:07:59 Finally, a third situation
00:08:01 that’s paralyzing for some is “imagined guilt.”
00:08:06 This is guilt over something you think you did but didn’t.
00:08:11 For example, Theresa’s daughter died in a car accident,
00:08:15 and she says, “I felt guilty
00:08:17 that I had sent her out that night on an errand.”
00:08:21 Another sister says,
00:08:23 “The guilt that you feel during a divorce,
00:08:25 “even if you’re not the guilty party,
00:08:28 can be overwhelming.”
00:08:30 What can someone do in this situation?
00:08:34 First, it’s important not to bottle up those emotions.
00:08:37 Share your feelings with a friend who’ll really listen to you.
00:08:41 Allow them to reassure you
00:08:43 that irrational feelings are common,
00:08:46 especially when you’re grieving.
00:08:49 But second, no matter how much we love someone,
00:08:54 we can’t control his or her life.
00:08:57 Remember what Ecclesiastes 9:11 says,
00:09:02 and this is true for all of us:
00:09:05 “I have seen something further under the sun,
00:09:10 “that the swift do not always win the race,
00:09:13 “nor do the mighty win the battle,
00:09:15 “nor do the wise always have the food,
00:09:18 “nor do the intelligent always have the riches,
00:09:21 “nor do those with knowledge always have success,
00:09:24 “because time and unexpected events
00:09:28 overtake them all.”
00:09:31 So we are not to blame for things we cannot control.
00:09:36 Before you accuse yourself of wrongdoing,
00:09:39 make sure that wrongdoing actually took place.
00:09:43 Talk it over with a trusted friend,
00:09:45 and refocus your thoughts on the future.
00:09:48 Reflecting on all kinds of “if onlys”
00:09:52 won’t change anything, and it may slow down your recovery.
00:09:57 Don’t let inappropriate guilt control your life.
00:10:01 So in review, a guilty conscience
00:10:04 can and should move us
00:10:07 to confess our sins and to take positive action,
00:10:11 but inappropriate guilt is dangerous.
00:10:14 It can crush our spirit and keep us from giving our best to Jehovah.
00:10:19 Don’t let guilt paralyze you.
00:10:22 Concentrate all your energies
00:10:24 on what you can do right now and on what lies ahead.

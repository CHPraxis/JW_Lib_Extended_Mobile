00:00:01 The matter of dress and grooming
00:00:03 is a deeply personal matter.
00:00:05 It’s something that elicits
00:00:07 all sorts of emotions.
00:00:09 But let me just ask at this point,
00:00:11 What are you thinking about?
00:00:14 Maybe you’re thinking, ‘Why does he have this hat on his head?’
00:00:18 Some are thinking,
00:00:20 ‘This must be a very defining moment in Brother Jackson’s lifetime.’
00:00:25 Others are thinking: ‘Is this a new precedent?
00:00:28 We’ve never done that before.’
00:00:30 Well, let me take it off.
00:00:32 That was an object lesson
00:00:36 to point out how distracting our dress and grooming can be.
00:00:41 Yes, it can distract from the message that we bear.
00:00:44 Instead of thinking about what someone
00:00:46 is conveying in the message,
00:00:48 if our dress and grooming is just out of the ordinary
00:00:52 or something that is shocking,
00:00:55 then it certainly can take away from the glory to Jehovah
00:00:58 and also the message that we bear.
00:01:01 But when we go around the world,
00:01:03 we see a large variety of dress and grooming
00:01:07 used by our brothers and sisters.
00:01:09 Without showing you photos,
00:01:11 you might remember many of the Watchtower photographs
00:01:14 where our brothers are witnessing.
00:01:16 Some don’t have a tie; others don’t have a jacket.
00:01:20 In Fiji, of course,
00:01:22 men wear what might be referred to
00:01:25 as a kilt, or a sulu.
00:01:27 So there’s a large variety of dresses
00:01:32 and costumes and outfits that are acceptable.
00:01:35 And we probably noticed, too, some of the Governing Body members,
00:01:38 when they’ve released Bibles or have been at conventions,
00:01:41 they have donned some of the local attire.
00:01:45 So it’s not as if Jehovah’s organization
00:01:48 is so strict and inflexible
00:01:51 that we all have to dress exactly the same way.
00:01:55 It’s true, there are various circumstances
00:01:58 that God’s people face.
00:02:00 In some countries, there’s such a variety of items
00:02:04 that we can use for dress and grooming.
00:02:07 In other countries, there really aren’t as many things
00:02:09 that our brothers can use.
00:02:11 I know my wife and I were very touched
00:02:13 a number of years ago when we attended a regional convention.
00:02:17 As I was waiting to give the last talk,
00:02:20 sitting behind the platform,
00:02:22 I noticed the brothers and sisters
00:02:25 who were in the Watchtower Study were giving comments.
00:02:27 And it really touched my heart
00:02:29 when I saw sisters come off of the platform
00:02:33 and then give their shoes and their jewelry
00:02:35 to other sisters who were about to go on the same platform.
00:02:39 You see, they didn’t have much; they shared what they had.
00:02:43 They didn’t have a lot of choice.
00:02:45 But sometimes we know that some of you dear sisters, particularly,
00:02:50 may go into a department store
00:02:52 and it may look like you have a huge variety
00:02:55 of things that you can choose from.
00:02:57 But when you start looking, sometimes you may feel
00:03:00 like those sisters at that particular convention
00:03:02 —that there really isn’t a lot that you can use as a Christian.
00:03:07 So, what can help us?
00:03:09 Well, the encouraging thing is that wherever you go in the world
00:03:11 where the brothers have ties or jackets or whatever they have,
00:03:15 there’s one thing in common:
00:03:17 Jehovah’s people try to be neat, clean, and presentable.
00:03:22 And from the Governing Body’s viewpoint,
00:03:25 of course, you know we’re not trying to make all sorts of rules
00:03:28 —rigid rules— with regard to this.
00:03:30 So, what can help us to help our brothers and sisters to have the right viewpoint
00:03:35 —the viewpoint that brings glory to Jehovah?
00:03:37 Well, I thought we might think of five Scriptural principles.
00:03:41 Now, there are many other Scriptural principles we could look at,
00:03:44 but these are five principles that perhaps could help us.
00:03:47 So, first of all, let’s take our Bibles
00:03:50 and turn to 1 Timothy 2:9,
00:03:54 and we are going to have this on the screen
00:03:56 with the highlighted portions.
00:03:58 “Likewise, the women should adorn themselves
00:04:02 “in appropriate [and then notice the footnote says “respectable”] dress,
00:04:07 “with modesty and soundness of mind
00:04:11 “[and again look at the footnote, “good judgment; sensibleness”],
00:04:16 “not with styles of hair braiding and gold
00:04:19 or pearls or very expensive clothing.”
00:04:24 So, what principle do we get here,
00:04:26 no matter where we live in the world?
00:04:28 Well, certainly, we wouldn’t want any clothing
00:04:32 that’s showy or bizarre
00:04:35 or provocative or that’s revealing
00:04:38 or too extreme with regard to fads.
00:04:42 Again, the principle of the hat
00:04:45 —if we’re doing something or wearing something that,
00:04:49 really, is so different from what is expected, what happens?
00:04:53 Well, perhaps at the very least, it distracts from the message,
00:04:58 but it could be a lot worse than that, couldn’t it?
00:05:00 It could give the wrong impression with regard to our morals and so forth.
00:05:05 Now, a second scripture we can look at
00:05:08 is at 2 Corinthians 6:3.
00:05:13 “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling,
00:05:17 so that no fault may be found with our ministry.”
00:05:21 Notice the comment here,
00:05:23 “no way” or “any cause.”
00:05:27 So whatever selections we make with regard to dress and grooming,
00:05:32 we certainly would want to make sure
00:05:34 that in no way at all could this cause some stumbling
00:05:38 on the part of those
00:05:40 not only outside the congregation when we’re presenting the message
00:05:44 but also within the congregation.
00:05:46 If we were to wear something that could be provocative,
00:05:50 perhaps it would arouse in some wrong desires.
00:05:54 So having that in mind gives us a good principle
00:05:57 with regard to selection of dress and grooming.
00:06:01 Now, a third principle
00:06:03 is found in the book of Numbers 15:39.
00:06:08 And we might say that this is in the context
00:06:11 of the Israelite nation when Jehovah did give them
00:06:14 some strict laws with regard to dress and grooming
00:06:19 —laws that made sure the Israelites
00:06:21 would be different from the nations around them.
00:06:24 So let’s read Numbers 15:39:
00:06:26 “You must have this fringed edge so that you will see it
00:06:30 and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and observe them.”
00:06:34 And notice this point:
00:06:36 “You must not follow your own hearts and eyes,
00:06:40 which are leading you to spiritual prostitution.”
00:06:44 Now, that’s a very interesting principle, isn’t it?
00:06:47 We’re not for one minute suggesting
00:06:49 that we have to have these fringed edges on our garments today.
00:06:53 But what’s the thought?
00:06:55 Jehovah was telling them
00:06:57 that when you’re selecting what you wear,
00:06:59 don’t just follow your hearts and eyes.
00:07:03 In other words, we shouldn’t feel:
00:07:06 ‘Well, I really like this. This is just nice.
00:07:09 ‘It suits me.
00:07:11 It reflects the colors of my skin,’
00:07:14 or whatever other feelings we may have.
00:07:17 But, rather, there are a lot more factors to take into consideration.
00:07:21 No doubt, there were some back in Israelite times
00:07:24 that didn’t like a fringe on the edge of their garments,
00:07:27 but having in mind what Jehovah wanted
00:07:30 helped them to see what they needed to do.
00:07:33 So the principle is a good principle for us today
00:07:36 —to ask such questions as:
00:07:38 Will this raise eyebrows?
00:07:41 Will it lower the standards that I have?
00:07:45 Does it fit?
00:07:47 Is it the appropriate dress for my age?
00:07:52 Those are important questions that all of us need to think about.
00:07:56 Well, a fourth principle is found
00:07:58 at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.
00:08:04 And again, it’s one of the principles
00:08:06 perhaps we would have thought of when we were thinking about this subject.
00:08:10 “All things are lawful,
00:08:12 “but not all things are advantageous.
00:08:16 “All things are lawful,
00:08:18 “but not all things build up.
00:08:20 “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage,
00:08:24 but that of the other person.”
00:08:26 So again, what type of questions would we need to ask?
00:08:30 Well, perhaps this selection we’ve made
00:08:34 is not so bad
00:08:36 that we’re going to have someone come and talk to us about it.
00:08:39 But is it upbuilding?
00:08:41 Does it represent Jehovah in a fine manner
00:08:45 (and we could say) not only at times of worship,
00:08:49 when we are in the Kingdom Hall or when we’re witnessing,
00:08:52 but also when we’re relaxing?
00:08:55 Would someone be shocked to find out that we’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:08:59 when we’re on vacation because of the way we’re dressed?
00:09:03 Well, those are interesting questions, aren’t they?
00:09:06 And the final scripture that perhaps gives us a little direction
00:09:10 is at Philippians 3:17.
00:09:14 Here Paul says:
00:09:16 “Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers,
00:09:19 “and keep your eye on those who are walking in a way that is
00:09:22 in harmony with the example we set for you.”
00:09:26 Now, what’s the thought behind that principle?
00:09:29 Well, if we have questions in our mind with regard to dress and grooming,
00:09:34 it’s good for us to look at those who are mature in the congregation.
00:09:38 Yes, what do they wear?
00:09:41 What standards have been set within the congregation as a whole?
00:09:46 And that will give us some idea as to what type of clothing we should wear.
00:09:51 So, brothers and sisters, particularly the Bethel family,
00:09:54 we commend you for the dress and grooming that you display.
00:09:57 We know that it does bring honor to Jehovah.
00:10:00 But let’s always keep in mind these basic principles.
00:10:05 Yes, without making a whole lot of rigid laws,
00:10:07 let’s always do things to Jehovah’s glory.

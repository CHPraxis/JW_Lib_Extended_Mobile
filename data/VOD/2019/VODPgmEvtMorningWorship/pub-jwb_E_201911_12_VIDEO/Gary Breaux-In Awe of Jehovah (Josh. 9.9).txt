00:00:01 The whole obligation
00:00:03 and privilege of mankind
00:00:05 is to develop a relationship
00:00:08 with our God and Maker, Jehovah.
00:00:12 But the question is,
00:00:13 How do we develop that relationship?
00:00:17 And then, How do we keep it?
00:00:20 Well, let’s start with, How do we develop it?
00:00:24 If you open to Ecclesiastes 12:13,
00:00:29 note the two components mentioned in this verse
00:00:34 —Ecclesiastes 12:13.
00:00:38 It says: “The conclusion of the matter,
00:00:41 “everything having been heard, is:
00:00:44 “Fear the true God and keep his commandments,
00:00:48 for this is the whole obligation of man.”
00:00:52 So the obligation begins with fearing the true God
00:00:57 and then keeping his commandments.
00:00:59 So, what does it mean to fear?
00:01:01 What kind of fear are we talking about?
00:01:03 The Insight book says this:
00:01:05 “The fear of God is healthful;
00:01:09 “it is an awe
00:01:11 “and a profound reverence for the Creator
00:01:14 “and a wholesome dread of displeasing him.
00:01:17 “This fear of incurring his displeasure
00:01:21 “is a result of appreciation
00:01:24 “of his loving-kindness and goodness
00:01:27 “together with the realization that he is the Supreme Judge
00:01:30 and the Almighty.”
00:01:33 So how does one come to have this awe of God?
00:01:38 Well, as the text says today that we’ve already read,
00:01:41 ‘we first hear about his fame
00:01:45 and about all he has done.’
00:01:48 Now, it’s of interest that just simply hearing
00:01:51 and knowing what he does
00:01:53 does not necessarily lead to awe
00:01:56 or to the kind of awe
00:01:58 that will help us develop a relationship with him.
00:02:02 The Scriptures explain this if you go to Joshua chapter 9,
00:02:07 where we read about a group of Canaanite kings.
00:02:10 In Joshua chapter 9
00:02:14 and in verse 1, it says:
00:02:17 “When all the kings who were on the west side of the Jordan
00:02:21 heard what had happened.”
00:02:23 Well, what did they hear that had happened?
00:02:28 Well, of course, the stories of the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt
00:02:32 was one thing they heard
00:02:34 and also the mighty acts of Jehovah God in connection with his people.
00:02:38 And then when Israel first penetrated Canaan
00:02:42 after crossing the Jordan,
00:02:44 they set up a camp at Gilgal,
00:02:46 which was not far from the walled city of Jericho.
00:02:50 And these Canaanite kings
00:02:52 had heard about what Jehovah did at Jericho
00:02:55 —the great destruction there in behalf of his people.
00:03:00 And remember, Rahab was spared, and her family was spared,
00:03:04 because when she heard about the mighty acts of Jehovah God,
00:03:08 it moved her to put faith in him.
00:03:11 Now, if you just glance through Joshua chapter 8,
00:03:14 we find that following that great destruction,
00:03:19 they went to Ai —the city of Ai.
00:03:22 And Jehovah God had instructed them how to ambush that city,
00:03:27 which led to the destruction there.
00:03:29 So after hearing those acts of Jehovah and then many other acts of Jehovah,
00:03:34 what did it do to the Canaanite kings?
00:03:36 Were they moved with awe?
00:03:39 Well, let’s read chapter 9, verse 2.
00:03:42 It says: “They formed an alliance
00:03:45 to fight against Joshua and Israel.”
00:03:49 So it had the opposite effect upon them, didn’t it?
00:03:53 But now, notice the different reaction it had upon the Gibeonites.
00:03:57 Now, they heard the very same reports,
00:04:00 and in chapter 9 and verse 9, it says:
00:04:05 “At this they said to him:
00:04:07 “‘Your servants have come from a very distant land
00:04:10 “‘out of regard for the name of Jehovah your God,
00:04:14 “‘because we have heard about his fame
00:04:18 “‘and about all he did in Egypt
00:04:20 and about all he did to the two kings of the Amorites.’”
00:04:24 So in this case,
00:04:26 they heard it and it led to their awe,
00:04:30 which led to their developing a relationship with Jehovah God.
00:04:34 Well, today, the same thing is true
00:04:36 that the mighty acts of Jehovah God
00:04:39 are all around us.
00:04:41 And those that are “rightly disposed”
00:04:43 recognize them and are moved to this awe
00:04:47 that leads to a good relationship with Jehovah God.
00:04:50 We have a number of experiences in this regard
00:04:55 that are related to the relief efforts going on right now.
00:04:58 I’d like to share one of them with you.
00:05:00 It was in the middle of the night, Monday, October 9, 2017,
00:05:04 and the wildfires began to engulf areas
00:05:07 around the city of Santa Rosa, California.
00:05:10 The elders began to call, text,
00:05:13 and even personally alert those in the congregation
00:05:17 that they needed to evacuate immediately.
00:05:19 And in time, hundreds of friends made their way to the Kingdom Hall,
00:05:24 and from there arrangements were made
00:05:26 for these displaced publishers to be housed
00:05:30 with their brothers and sisters
00:05:33 in unaffected areas, especially to the south.
00:05:36 Well, there was one Spanish family that hesitated to accept the hospitality
00:05:41 that was being extended to them, and they did not want to be relocated.
00:05:46 And upon the loving inquiries of the elders,
00:05:49 it was learned that the father was a non-Witness
00:05:53 and he felt uncomfortable staying in another Witness home.
00:05:57 And he was embarrassed at the way he looked,
00:05:59 the way he was dressed,
00:06:01 and how dirty he was because of the circumstances.
00:06:05 So he requested to stay overnight at the Kingdom Hall with his family.
00:06:10 Well, temporary beds were set up at the Kingdom Hall.
00:06:14 And during the night, the circuit overseer
00:06:16 had children singing Kingdom songs on the platform
00:06:20 which really encouraged all.
00:06:23 The next morning,
00:06:25 after experiencing the loving atmosphere in the Kingdom Hall
00:06:29 and seeing how well Jehovah took care of this man’s family,
00:06:34 as well as the other publishers,
00:06:36 the man stated that he was going to call the brother back
00:06:39 who studied with him many years ago
00:06:41 and he would resume his Bible study
00:06:43 and he would never ever miss a meeting again.
00:06:49 Yes, those “rightly disposed” become in awe of Jehovah God,
00:06:54 and that moves them to have a good relationship with him.
00:06:57 Remember, ‘the whole obligation of man is to fear God.’
00:07:03 So the question is, Now that we have developed
00:07:06 this relationship with Jehovah God,
00:07:09 how do we keep it?
00:07:12 Well, for sure, we must continue to be observant
00:07:15 of Jehovah’s mighty acts
00:07:17 in connection not only with ourselves
00:07:21 but in connection with his people worldwide.
00:07:25 Never should we allow the wonderful experiences that we hear
00:07:30 —the outstanding World Service Report
00:07:34 or the support and comfort that Jehovah God is giving those in need—
00:07:38 to become commonplace to us.
00:07:42 We must stay in awe of our God and Father.
00:07:48 Now, you remember the first scripture we read in Ecclesiastes
00:07:52 where it says that in addition to fearing the true God,
00:07:55 we’re told to keep his commandments.
00:07:59 So it would be good to ask ourselves this question:
00:08:02 ‘What commandment of Jehovah God do I have difficulty keeping?
00:08:08 ‘Is it a commandment that involves my self-control,
00:08:13 ‘my zeal,
00:08:15 ‘my humility,
00:08:17 or perhaps my honesty?’
00:08:21 If so, then we should give immediate attention
00:08:24 to improving the spiritual person that we are
00:08:28 so that keeping God’s commandments
00:08:31 will become as easy as being in awe
00:08:36 of what Jehovah is doing in behalf of his people.
00:08:40 Brothers and sisters,
00:08:42 we stand at the threshold of the promised new world,
00:08:46 and may we heed the words here at Hebrews 12:28
00:08:50 (by not only developing
00:08:53 but by keeping a relationship with Jehovah God),
00:08:56 where it says
00:08:58 —Hebrews 12:28:
00:09:03 “Therefore, seeing that we are to receive
00:09:05 “a Kingdom that cannot be shaken,
00:09:08 “let us continue to receive undeserved kindness,
00:09:11 “through which we may acceptably offer God
00:09:14 sacred service with godly fear and awe.”

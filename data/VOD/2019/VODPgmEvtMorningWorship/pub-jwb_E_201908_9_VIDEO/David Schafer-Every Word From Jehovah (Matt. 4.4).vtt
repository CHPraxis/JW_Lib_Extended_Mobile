I invite you to turn, please,

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Proverbs chapter 17.

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:08.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And as you locate this in your Bible,

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:11.394 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I invite you also to imagine

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:13.963 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
two runners.

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:16.332 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One is rich;

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:18.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the other is poor.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rich runner has a gymnasium,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:24.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an olympic-size pool,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the weight machines,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a nutritionist, a physical therapist,
a doctor, and a personal trainer.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has access
to the finest foods there are.

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But somewhere along the way,

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s grown just a little bored
with the whole concept of footraces,

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:46.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so he hasn’t put his heart into training.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:51.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, lined up next
to him is the poor runner.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:54.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The poor runner also has a few advantages.

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:56.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a good pair of shoes;

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:59.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has real food;

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he eats—not much—mostly plants.

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he loves the race;
he has a heart for it;

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he trains in all kinds of weather.

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, which of the two will win the race?

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man with the most advantages

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the man with the heart?

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with that illustration in mind,
notice what it says

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 17:16:

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What good is it

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the stupid one has the means

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:42.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to acquire wisdom when he has no heart

00:01:42.552 --> 00:01:44.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for acquiring it?”

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:50.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like winning a race, acquiring wisdom

00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not happen without effort,

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:56.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without cost, without sacrifice.

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hence, a person has to have the means.

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, doesn’t Jehovah really supply

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the necessary ingredients

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each of us to acquire wisdom?

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:10.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us have access to thinking ability,

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
information, opportunities,

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
evidence in some degree or another

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if we really want it.

00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:22.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as Proverbs 17:16 asks,

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What good is that if a person has no heart,

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:31.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no drive, no sense?’

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about the multiplicity
of our advantages

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:39.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the quality of our advantages;

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:43.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s about the heart
—the total inner person.

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:47.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when it comes to acquiring true wisdom
and making sound decisions

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite not having much data
at one’s disposal,

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our publications have often pointed
to the example of Joseph.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long before Moses
recorded Jehovah’s law against adultery,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph understood
that this was a sin against God.

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:10.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recall his words at Genesis 39:9:

00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no one greater
in this house than I am,

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he has not withheld
from me anything at all except you,

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you are his wife.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:23.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So how could I commit this great badness

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually sin against God?”

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—conscience fully engaged.

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,
How did Joseph know that?

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Follow along in Genesis,

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider what may have
influenced his thinking.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph had one Bible principle

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no less than four real-life applications

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:49.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that principle to meditate on.

00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:53.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principle, of course,
is stated at Genesis 2:24:

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:57.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why a man

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will leave his father and his mother
and he will stick to his wife,

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will become one flesh.”

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words of Jehovah God himself

00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(earth’s first wedding talk),

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘one man, one wife, one flesh’

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s the standard.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph meditated on that.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, he meditated on what happened
to his great-grandfather Abram,

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:26.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 12, as Abram and Sarai

00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveled to Egypt—Genesis 12:17.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This account tells us that Abram failed

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:34.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tell Pharaoh that he was married to Sarai,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so when Pharaoh
showed special interest in Sarai,

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:40.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 12:17 says

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:43.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Jehovah struck Pharaoh
and [all] his household

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:47.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with severe plagues because of Sarai,

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abram’s wife.”

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later in chapter 20, Abraham and Sarah

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to the land of Gerar

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and employed a similar strategy;

00:04:57.613 --> 00:04:59.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t reveal that they were married.

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the king of Gerar, Abimelech,

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had this experience at Genesis 20:3:

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Afterward, God came by night

00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to Abimelech in a dream and said to him:

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here you are as good as dead

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because of the woman whom you have taken,

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘since she is married

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and belongs to another man.’”

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Abimelech said to Jehovah,
‘Listen, I didn’t know.’

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah said,
‘I know you didn’t know.’

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so he says in verse 6 at the end:

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:34.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I held you back

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from sinning against me.”

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sinning against me”

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Joseph undoubtedly meditated on that.

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, at Genesis 26:10,

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his grandfather Isaac
and his grandmother Rebecca

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also went to Gerar.

00:05:57.173 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also met a man named Abimelech,

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely a successor
of the Abimelech mentioned in chapter 20,

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they too didn’t tell Abimelech

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were married,
but the king found out.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so at Genesis 26:10:

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abimelech continued:
‘What have you done to us?

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘One of the people
could easily have lain down with your wife,

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you would have brought guilt

00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:22.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[guilt] upon us!’”

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Undoubtedly, Joseph meditated on that.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or consider what happened
in Genesis chapter 34.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principle recorded at Genesis 2:24

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again came into play
—a man, his wife, one flesh.

00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:38.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shechem was not yet married to Dinah,

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:40.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he violated her.

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:43.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Genesis 34:7 says:

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:47.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Something like that ought not to be done.’

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was how it was viewed.

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while it’s true
that Joseph didn’t have the Mosaic Law,

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:54.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young People Ask,
Learn From the Great Teacher,

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Library®, or jw.org,

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had a principle.

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:01.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had enough.

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had seen no fewer

00:07:04.807 --> 00:07:08.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than four applications of that principle.

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:10.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If only Reuben and Judah

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had also had such appreciation
for that principle.

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is,
Joseph fed his heart with that knowledge.

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s also another important factor

00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:22.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can’t lose sight of at Genesis 39:21.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just
an intellectual exercise for Joseph.

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at chapter 39
and what it says in verse 21:

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:34.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah continued

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Joseph
and kept showing loyal love to him.”

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, even before

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the situation where he was tested
with Potiphar’s wife,

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had been showing loyal love to him.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s born out in Genesis 39:3.

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And afterward, he kept showing loyal love.

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to whom does Jehovah show loyal love?

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah shows loyal love
to those acting in loyalty toward him.

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that bespeak a relationship?

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph wasn’t just interested;

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t just love
Jehovah’s righteous standards;

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he loved Jehovah as a person.

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the key.

00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:18.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to Psalm 119:9.

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:23.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph had what Proverbs calls
“the means to acquire wisdom.”

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t have the libraries, the websites,
and the Broadcast, but he had enough.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice the similarities
between Joseph’s situation

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that described here at Psalm 119:9:

00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:39.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How can a young man keep his path clean?

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By keeping on guard according to your word.

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With my whole heart I seek you.

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not let me stray from your commandments.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In my heart I treasure up your saying

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I may not sin against you.”

00:08:56.152 --> 00:09:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph had what
these verses are talking about.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He searched for Jehovah with his whole heart;

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he treasured up
Jehovah’s sayings in his heart.

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s how he
was able to stay true to Jehovah

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Person that he loved.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can do the same.

00:09:11.934 --> 00:09:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have so much more data than Joseph had.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have such excellent tools,

00:09:20.076 --> 00:09:23.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah hasn’t changed.

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:26.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the essential questions

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always boil down to this:

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is my heart?

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I still seeking Jehovah

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:39.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my whole heart?

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:44.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or are fear, greed, immoral desires,
and other negative emotions

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depriving me
from the completeness of my heart?

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:52.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If our heart is complete, then we can indeed

00:09:52.742 --> 00:09:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoid being swept away

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the flood of immoral propaganda

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spewed out by Satan’s system of things.

It is interesting that Peter gives counsel

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about cultivating humility.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn the clock back

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and learn why the quality of humility

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was indelibly etched

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the mind and heart of Peter.

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:18.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Luke chapter 22.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Luke chapter 22,

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:24.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll find Jesus getting ready
for that final Passover in 33 C.E.

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Luke 22, starting in verse 8,

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is Thursday afternoon, Nisan 13,
and what happens?

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8: “Jesus sent Peter [there he is]

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and John, saying: ‘Go and get

00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Passover ready for us to eat.’”

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Get it ready, Peter and John.’

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 9: “They said to him:
‘Where do you want us to get it ready?’”

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They understood the instructions: Get it ready.

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:55.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said to go into Jerusalem,

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll find the man
with the earthenware jar.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 12: “And that man

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will show you
a large, furnished upper room.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:07.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get it ready there.”

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13: “So they left 
and found it just as he had told them,

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:16.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they prepared for the Passover.”

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get it ready; prepare the Passover.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that include?

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:27.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bread, wine, oil for the lamps,

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lamb, a towel, a basin, water.

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basin and water

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they knew 
how important washing feet was.

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:42.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They witnessed when
Jesus reproved Simon the Pharisee

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the statement: Simon,
“you gave me no water for my feet.”

00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Simon, you gave me no water.

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:52.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You missed the mark on this one.’

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as they stared
at that basin and water,

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:00.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they prepared
and got the room ready,

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did they look at each other
and wonder:

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who’s going to wash the feet?

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s going to do it?’

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:11.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had a golden opportunity
to apply all the things that Jesus

00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:14.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been teaching them
for three and a half years on humility.

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:16.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the time.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After three and a half years,
conduct yourself as a lesser one.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t lord it over others.

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to serve others and not be served.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was it; this was the time.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could have showed Jesus
that they got the point; they got it.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had time to think about it
and time to pray about it.

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:35.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Thursday afternoon,

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now we progress
and let’s see what happens.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now progress 
to the evening, and it’s Nisan 14.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s pick up the account in John chapter 13.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They got the room ready,
they followed the instructions,

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:54.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now let’s go to John 13
and get John’s vantage point from this.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was there;
he was with Peter getting it ready.

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:04.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now it’s 98 C.E.,
and John is writing this information.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had time to reflect
and to think about this for years,

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now look what he says in verse 3:

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jesus,

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that the Father
had given all things into his hands

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he came from God
and was going to God.”

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing these things
—he understood that.

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:30.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sat back and said:
‘Jesus knew who he was; he knew all things.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He had the full understanding of his dignity.

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew that he
had been entrusted with all things.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew he was the second greatest
personage in the universe.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:43.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew he was
“the firstborn of all creation.”

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew he had
shared with his Father in creating all things.

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:50.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had knowledge of all this
—knowing all these things.’

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John sits back; he writes this.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then knowing this,

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 4 is the contrast:

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He got up from the evening meal
and laid aside his outer garments.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Taking a towel,
he wraps it around his waist.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘After that, he puts the water
into the basin

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and starts to wash
the feet of the disciples

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dry them off with the towel
that was wrapped around him.’

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:17.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing who He was,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John said He did this.

00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:24.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only does John reflect
on who Jesus was,

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:28.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, he reflects on why Jesus did it.

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:29.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he do it?

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what John was interested in,

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we get that answer back in verse 1,

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where John says why:

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:42.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Because he loved his own
that were in the world;

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he loved them to the end.’

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John said He “loved them to the end.”

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to instill in them qualities
that would help them conquer the world,

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities that would strengthen
the Christian congregation,

00:04:56.946 --> 00:05:00.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities such as unselfish love
and humility.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved them to the end.

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up on them.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had their weaknesses,
but he did not give up.

00:05:07.924 --> 00:05:11.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for Peter, some 30 years later,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s thinking about humility.

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John, some 60 years later,

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:18.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the lesson Jesus taught
about humility,

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s echoing loud and clear
in his mind and heart.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the fact remains
that neither of them

00:05:26.442 --> 00:05:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the humility at the time
to apply what Jesus

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:32.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been teaching them
for three and a half years.

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:37.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after John finished his writing, he sat back;

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was under inspiration;
he finished that writing.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he sit back,
reread what he just wrote,

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:46.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps say to himself:

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I wish I could have written

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that after Jesus washed the feet
of one or two of his disciples,

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I got up and washed the feet

00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of the rest of my brothers?

00:06:01.177 --> 00:06:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I took that towel, and I imitated the Christ?

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, Peter and I got up?’

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is, they didn’t.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn?

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow valuable lessons
that Jesus teaches us

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to echo in our minds and hearts

00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only after we missed
the opportunity to apply them.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:29.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a practical setting
for us serving here at Bethel:

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Even though I know
I have the seniority

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:36.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—I have full knowledge of my seniority—

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will I get up and fight the attitude
of entitlement?

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have
authority entrusted to me as the overseer;

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I am the overseer;
I know that. I have full knowledge of that.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Fine, will I get up

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:55.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and roll my sleeves back
and do the grunt work?

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:59.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or do I just find pleasure
in giving orders?

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have
a wonderful privilege of service;

00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know that; others know it too.

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:09.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine, but will I get up to train others?’

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Jackson reminded us of this
at the last Gilead graduation

00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he said to treasure your privileges,
but don’t hoard them.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we have to get up.

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes humility 
to train others to take our place.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:28.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘As a brother or a sister,

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:33.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have more experience
than the other person in my job.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have the experience; I know that.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:38.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I have more experience than my workmate.

00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Fine, but will I get up in all humility

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:46.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and share information that I have

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:50.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘with others to make their job easier?

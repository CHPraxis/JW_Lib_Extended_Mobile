00:00:01 James 3:5, 6 tells us in part:
00:00:05 “The tongue is a small part of the body,
00:00:10 “and yet . . . see how small a fire it takes
00:00:14 “to set a great forest ablaze!
00:00:16 The tongue is also a fire.”
00:00:20 Well, just how small is the tongue?
00:00:24 An average adult’s tongue weighs
00:00:27 only about two and a half ounces (70 g).
00:00:29 That’s a small part of the body weight of a 200-pound (90 kg) man.
00:00:33 But that little two-ounce tongue has great power.
00:00:37 If you think about it, it can actually lift thousands of pounds of weight
00:00:41 —for example, when a chairman at a convention says, “Please stand.”
00:00:49 Of course, that power
00:00:51 can be used for good or for bad.
00:00:54 And the warning in today’s scripture text:
00:00:57 If we’re not careful, it can cause great damage,
00:01:01 just like a tiny lighted match flipped carelessly aside
00:01:06 can burn thousands of acres
00:01:09 of beautiful trees to the ground.
00:01:12 Well, what are types of speech that can be like a destructive fire?
00:01:16 Lying, slander, backbiting, harmful gossip,
00:01:21 and false teaching —a few examples.
00:01:23 But during our discussion, let’s talk
00:01:26 about a type of speech that may be more subtle, more insidious,
00:01:31 but nevertheless is very harmful.
00:01:33 What is it? Murmuring.
00:01:36 Let’s discuss: “Avoid Murmuring.”
00:01:40 Now, what is murmuring?
00:01:43 According to the dictionary, to murmur
00:01:46 means “to make a low, continuous,
00:01:48 indistinct sound or succession of sounds.”
00:01:51 Of course, in nature,
00:01:53 there are many very pleasant murmuring sounds.
00:01:57 For example, it’s pleasant to listen
00:02:00 to gentle breezes murmur through the leaves of trees.
00:02:05 It’s soothing to listen
00:02:07 to a small stream murmuring its way
00:02:11 through a forest or down a mountain slope.
00:02:13 But the same cannot be said about murmuring by the human tongue.
00:02:18 It is far from pleasant.
00:02:21 One dictionary said that “murmuring by humans
00:02:24 “means complaining
00:02:27 in low mumbling tones, grumbling.”
00:02:32 The Watchtower said
00:02:34 that “the Hebrew term meaning ‘to murmur’ can also mean ‘to growl.’”
00:02:39 When we’re out in service and if a dog growls at us,
00:02:43 it’s not a pleasant sound that draws us.
00:02:45 We want to distance ourselves.
00:02:48 Of course, murmuring permeates Satan’s world.
00:02:52 Children murmur against their parents;
00:02:55 wives murmur against their husbands;
00:02:58 employees murmur against their employers;
00:03:02 multitudes murmur against God,
00:03:05 blaming him for bad things that happen.
00:03:08 But, now, here’s an important question, How does Jehovah view murmuring?
00:03:13 Well, open up to Numbers chapter 12, please,
00:03:17 and here’s an interesting account
00:03:19 that gives us some insight into Jehovah’s viewpoint
00:03:22 —Numbers 12:1:
00:03:24 “Now Miriam and Aaron
00:03:27 “began to speak against Moses
00:03:29 because of the Cushite wife he had married.”
00:03:33 Verse 2: “They were saying
00:03:35 “[and apparently on an ongoing basis]:
00:03:39 “‘Is it only by Moses
00:03:42 “‘that Jehovah has spoken?
00:03:45 Has he not also spoken through us?’”
00:03:48 Now notice the next thought:
00:03:50 “And Jehovah was listening.”
00:03:53 And Jehovah didn’t like what he heard, did he?
00:03:56 If you look at verse 9, his “anger burned,”
00:03:59 and he struck Miriam with leprosy.
00:04:02 Now think about this: Of all the diseases
00:04:05 Jehovah could have struck Miriam with,
00:04:08 why did he choose leprosy?
00:04:10 Well, Jehovah doesn’t tell us.
00:04:12 But think about this: A person struck with leprosy,
00:04:15 especially in Bible times, was made physically repulsive,
00:04:20 or (you could say) physically ugly.
00:04:22 Well, by talking the way she was talking already,
00:04:25 she was spiritually repulsive in Jehovah’s eyes.
00:04:28 So by striking her with leprosy,
00:04:31 Jehovah allowed everyone to see
00:04:33 what Jehovah already saw in Miriam.
00:04:36 There’s another account two chapters later.
00:04:39 It talks about how the Israelites began to murmur
00:04:44 after hearing the negative report
00:04:47 from the ten spies.
00:04:49 How did Jehovah react?
00:04:51 He decreed that all the murmurers
20 years of age and over
00:04:55 would never make it to the Promised Land.
00:04:58 They would die in the wilderness.
00:05:00 So, obviously, Jehovah hates murmuring.
00:05:03 You could say that he abominates it.
00:05:05 But now the question is, Why?
00:05:08 Well, let’s briefly discuss three reasons.
00:05:11 One: It breeds discontent
00:05:15 both in ourselves and in others.
00:05:18 Jude 16 speaks of ‘murmurers
00:05:22 complaining about their lot in life.’
00:05:25 And it’s true that the more
00:05:28 a person complains about his lot in life,
00:05:32 then the deeper the discontent becomes in his own heart.
00:05:35 And since murmurers never keep their complaints to themselves,
00:05:39 it sows discontent in others.
00:05:43 And if you think about this:
00:05:45 Who was the original promoter of discontent with one’s lot in life?
00:05:49 Satan the Devil.
00:05:52 He succeeded in sowing discontent in Eve’s heart.
00:05:55 So a murmurer is actually imitating the methods of the Devil,
00:06:00 and apparently a murmurer
00:06:02 reminds Jehovah of his archenemy, Satan.
00:06:05 And that’s certainly something no wise person wants to do
00:06:08 —to remind Jehovah of Satan.
00:06:10 Well, what is the antidote?
00:06:13 Cultivating contentment.
00:06:16 First Timothy 6:6:
00:06:18 “There is great gain in godly devotion along with contentment.”
00:06:23 And several scriptures talk about contentment.
00:06:26 And when we count our blessings that we have from Jehovah,
00:06:30 we can be content —can’t we?—
00:06:32 no matter what our circumstances now.
00:06:35 A second reason Jehovah hates it:
00:06:38 It incites hatred,
00:06:40 again, both in our own heart and in others.
00:06:44 Open up to Proverbs chapter 17, please.
00:06:47 And here’s an interesting scripture on this,
00:06:50 Proverbs 17:9:
00:06:54 “Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love,
00:06:59 “but the one who keeps harping on a matter
00:07:03 separates close friends.”
00:07:06 So notice, love should move us to cover over, forgive, the transgressions of others.
00:07:11 But if we don’t do that and we keep harping
00:07:14 about their transgressions,
00:07:16 murmuring about them,
00:07:18 then hatred for that one grows in our own heart.
00:07:21 And how does it affect others?
00:07:23 Well, again, it sows hatred in their heart.
00:07:26 The Watchtower some years ago had a little article
00:07:29 “Why Keep Free from Murmuring?”
00:07:31 And it gave an example.
00:07:33 It says: “Suppose . . . a Christian starts to complain to you
00:07:37 “about a certain appointed elder
00:07:39 “[about how he performs his duties, how he] . . .
00:07:42 handles his parts on the platform.”
00:07:44 And it says: “If you listen to the complainer,
00:07:48 “you can begin to think as he does.
00:07:50 “Then, as you observe the elder, you could be saying to yourself:
00:07:54 “‘Now that I think [about] it,
00:07:56 “‘what my friend says about this elder is true.
00:08:01 I never thought of it that way before.’”
00:08:03 Before it didn’t bother you; now it bothers you.
00:08:05 Eventually, everything the elder does
00:08:08 can be improper in your eyes.
00:08:12 But, now, what is the antidote?
00:08:14 Well, like it said in Proverbs:
00:08:17 “Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love”
00:08:22 —so cultivating love, making allowances for others,
00:08:27 forgiving them, not harping about their transgressions,
00:08:31 but forgiving as we pray and hope Jehovah will do for us.
00:08:35 But, now, the third reason Jehovah hates it: It manifests pride.
00:08:39 Korah, Dathan, Abiram
00:08:42 —remember they murmured against Moses.
00:08:45 “We have had enough of you!
00:08:47 “The whole assembly is holy, all of them,
00:08:50 “and Jehovah is in their midst.
00:08:52 “Why, then, should you exalt yourselves
00:08:54 above the congregation of Jehovah?”
00:08:56 Their murmuring was an outward expression
00:09:00 of an inward condition—pride.
00:09:04 And we know how Jehovah reacted in that case.
00:09:06 But, now, what’s the antidote?
00:09:08 Humility, lowliness of mind
00:09:11 —not trying to tear others down
00:09:13 with our talking to elevate ourselves.
00:09:17 But lowliness of mind will protect us.
00:09:20 So we’ve discussed that murmuring
00:09:23 breeds discontent, incites hatred, manifests pride.
00:09:28 No wonder Jehovah hates it.
00:09:31 But as we said, if we cultivate contentment,
00:09:35 love, and we cultivate humility,
00:09:39 these will serve as antidotes to our ever becoming murmurers.
00:09:44 And we’ll be successful in applying Philippians 2:14,
00:09:48 which says: “Keep doing all things
00:09:51 free from murmuring.”
00:09:54 And it didn’t say most things.
00:09:56 “Keep doing all things free from murmuring,”
00:09:59 and we’ll prove to Jehovah that we’re assets in his organization.
00:10:03 He’ll want us in his organization now;
00:10:06 he’ll want us in his new world in the future.

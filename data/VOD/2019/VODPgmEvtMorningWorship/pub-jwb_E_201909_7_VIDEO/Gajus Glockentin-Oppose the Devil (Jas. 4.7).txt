00:00:01 James 4:7:
00:00:03 “Oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you”
00:00:06 is indeed powerful encouragement.
00:00:08 By these reassuring words,
00:00:10 Jehovah reminds us of the potential we have.
00:00:14 Why can we say so?
00:00:16 Because Jehovah would never expect us to do something
00:00:19 that is beyond our abilities.
00:00:21 And even if we ourselves in certain situations might feel
00:00:25 we do not have the strength anymore,
00:00:29 we know Jehovah will empower us.
00:00:33 Now,
00:00:34 when was the last time that you opposed the Devil?
00:00:39 We all understand the general concept of James 4:7,
00:00:43 and yet it might be a challenge
00:00:45 to get specific when it comes to applying it on a personal level.
00:00:50 We are not having conversations directly with the Devil
00:00:53 as Jesus did  when he was tempted three times.
00:00:57 And we know that the Devil
00:00:59 might not cause all of our problems,
00:01:03 but we also know
00:01:05 that he is sure to use them for his purpose.
00:01:11 Therefore, let us try
00:01:13 to analyze two examples, two areas,
00:01:17 where we oppose the Devil and experience that he flees from us.
00:01:21 First of all, let’s talk about our health.
00:01:25 Now, health problems are something
00:01:27 most of us have to deal with in one way or another.
00:01:31 Sadly, some of us even have to deal with serious issues or disabilities.
00:01:36 So, now, what does this have to do with opposing the Devil?
00:01:41 One of the subtle attacks of the Devil
00:01:43 is that he tries to use our proper concern for our health
00:01:47 in order to shift our focus away from spiritual things.
00:01:51 He wants to make use of us being overly distracted.
00:01:56 He would like us
00:01:58 to become consumed with matters of health to the extent
00:02:02 that they take first place in our life,
00:02:05 or he would like us to go to extremes
00:02:09 in striving to maintain our health.
00:02:13 But he has no success.
00:02:16 One of the reasons for this we find in Luke chapter 12.
00:02:20 I’d like to invite you to open with me to Luke chapter 12,
00:02:23 and we would like to read verse 25.
00:02:27 Here Jesus asked a good question.
00:02:30 He says:
00:02:32 “Who of you by being anxious
00:02:35 can add a cubit to his life span?”
00:02:40 So while we take good care of our health
00:02:44 in line with Jesus’ words found at Luke 5:31,
00:02:48 we are not becoming unduly anxious
00:02:51 over things we cannot control.
00:02:55 At the convention, I talked to one of the attendants,
00:02:57 a brother in his 30’s.
00:02:59 At first, it was just normal small talk till later in the conversation
00:03:04 he revealed to me that he was actually supposed to be at the hospital.
00:03:09 The doctors had told him
00:03:11 that he would not survive the next five months.
00:03:16 Would he now be fully absorbed in finding some treatment
00:03:20 and forgetting all of his spiritual routine?
00:03:23 No.
00:03:24 Our brother persisted in getting some medicine
00:03:27 to be able to attend the convention.
00:03:30 He wanted to serve as an attendant.
00:03:32 He wanted to care for others.
00:03:35 And so strengthened by the program,
00:03:37 he was ready to go back to the hospital the next day.
00:03:42 We are not sacrificing our spirituality.
00:03:45 We maintain our spiritual balance,
00:03:48 and despite our challenges, we are caring for others.
00:03:52 In this way, we oppose the Devil
00:03:54 —and some of us on a daily basis.
00:03:58 Now let’s look at this second example.
00:04:01 Another area where we successfully oppose the Devil is our attitude.
00:04:06 We all know that attitude makes a big difference in life.
00:04:10 For example, a positive or a negative attitude
00:04:15 can influence how we deal with certain situations
00:04:18 and how other people react to us.
00:04:21 The same is true with a complaining
00:04:25 or a grateful attitude.
00:04:28 If we had a bad attitude, nothing would seem right,
00:04:32 even when from an objective point of view,
00:04:35 life is just good.
00:04:38 It would be like
00:04:40 putting a dirty towel on a nice piece of decoration in our room.
00:04:47 So, what does this have to do with opposing the Devil?
00:04:52 A negative attitude can be used by Satan.
00:04:55 It can accumulate in our heart
00:04:57 and overpower our ability to decide wisely.
00:05:01 We might lose our joy in Jehovah’s service.
00:05:04 It also can weaken our resolve to resist wrongdoing.
00:05:07 So do we see how the Devil
00:05:10 would be able to benefit from it?
00:05:13 Of course, as Christ’s followers,
00:05:15 we avoid a negative or a complaining attitude,
00:05:18 although this is not always easy.
00:05:21 And maybe we feel down
00:05:25 because we are sometimes not content with what we’re able to accomplish.
00:05:29 Are we, for example, disappointed at times
00:05:33 that we did not reach a goal that we set for ourselves?
00:05:36 Maybe we were encouraged to spend more time in the ministry,
00:05:42 and then things just did not turn out the way we planned them.
00:05:46 And then we are sitting in a congregation meeting,
00:05:49 and we are listening to the nice experiences of others.
00:05:54 How do we feel?
00:05:56 Are we discouraged?
00:05:58 That can be dangerous.
00:06:00 Let’s turn to Proverbs chapter 24 together.
00:06:03 Let’s read together Proverbs 24:10
00:06:08 because here this danger
00:06:11 that can be utilized by Satan is identified.
00:06:15 Here we read at Proverbs 24:10:
00:06:19 “If you become discouraged in the day of distress
00:06:22 “[that’s what we’re talking about],
00:06:24 your strength will be meager.”
00:06:29 Prolonged negative feelings can rob us of our strength,
00:06:34 making us feel weak and vulnerable.
00:06:37 Satan knows this well.
00:06:39 It is difficult enough if our heart is plagued
00:06:42 with such feelings of unworthiness or worthlessness.
00:06:46 However, when Satan attempts to exploit such feelings,
00:06:50 it makes this situation even more burdensome.
00:06:55 So as we maintain a balanced view of ourselves
00:07:00 or, as the apostle Paul calls it at Romans 12:3,
00:07:05 as we maintain “a sound mind,”
00:07:08 we oppose the Devil.
00:07:11 As we remind ourselves that Jehovah just expects 100 percent
00:07:17 —our personal 100 percent, today’s 100 percent,
00:07:21 not the 100 percent of somebody else,
00:07:23 not the 100 percent of what we were able to do years ago
00:07:27 —and as we keep this balanced view of ourselves,
00:07:30 we are not doing the Devil’s work.
00:07:35 So when was the last time that you opposed the Devil?
00:07:40 We just discussed two subtle forms of his attacks.
00:07:44 Probably we are all opposing the Devil on a daily basis.
00:07:50 We do not allow ourselves to be unduly anxious about health matters,
00:07:55 and we work hard in maintaining a good attitude.
00:07:59 The fact
00:08:03 that we are here together today
00:08:05 is proof that we all oppose the Devil
00:08:08 and that we experience that he flees from us.

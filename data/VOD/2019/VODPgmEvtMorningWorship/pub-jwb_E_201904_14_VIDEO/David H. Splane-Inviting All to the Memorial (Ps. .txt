00:00:01 Good morning, everyone.
00:00:03 This Morning Worship program is originating
00:00:06 from world headquarters at Warwick, New York.
00:00:09 And, brothers and sisters,
00:00:11 it’s a real privilege and pleasure
00:00:13 to speak to all of you on this special day
00:00:16 when we observe the Memorial
00:00:18 of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
00:00:21 Today’s text will remind us
00:00:23 of the unjust treatment that he suffered at the hands of sinners.
00:00:26 And we have Brother William Malenfant here;
00:00:30 Bill is a helper to the Teaching Committee.
00:00:32 Bill, will you read the text for us, please?
00:00:35 Friday, April the 19th
00:00:38 —the Memorial date after sundown.
00:00:42 The text is taken from Psalm 118:22:
00:00:46 “The stone that the builders rejected
00:00:49 has become the chief cornerstone.”
00:00:53 Thank you, Bill.
00:00:55 Although Jesus was rejected by the leaders of the Jewish nation,
00:01:00 what got into him was having Jehovah’s approval.
00:01:03 You know, I love the way the apostle Peter put it
00:01:06 according to 1 Peter 2:4.
00:01:09 Peter said that Jesus was ‘rejected by men
00:01:14 but precious to God.’
00:01:16 Isn’t that nice?
00:01:18 Now, if you’re the type of person who gets a little bit upset
00:01:20 when you’re rejected at the doors (maybe someone slams a door in your face),
00:01:25 why not just think about this phrase
00:01:28 —‘rejected by men but precious to God’?
00:01:33 Memorize it: ‘rejected by men but precious to God.’
00:01:38 And then think about it; it’ll help.
00:01:41 Now, speaking of the ministry, I thought I’d focus the rest of my comments
00:01:45 on the important work we all have to do today
00:01:48 —to invite as many as possible to the Memorial.
00:01:51 If you have time off from work today,
00:01:54 no doubt you’ll be sharing in the ministry.
00:01:56 And that’s what Bethel family members
00:01:59 all over the world are going to be doing today.
00:02:02 But whether you have time off or not,
00:02:04 there are things you can do to make sure
00:02:07 that as many as possible are in attendance tonight.
00:02:10 If you have to go to work or to school,
00:02:13 why not talk to a workmate or a schoolmate
00:02:16 who you think would be willing
00:02:19 to attend the Memorial?
00:02:21 You might be happy at the outcome.
00:02:23 And don’t forget to get in touch
00:02:25 with your Bible students and return visits today.
00:02:29 I’m going to repeat that.
00:02:31 Don’t forget to get in touch
00:02:33 with your Bible students and return visits today,
00:02:37 even if you’ve already invited them to the Memorial.
00:02:40 Why?
00:02:42 Well, your return visits might have misplaced the invitation,
00:02:46 and perhaps they’ve forgotten what day it is.
00:02:49 All right, those are the return visits,
00:02:51 but what about our Bible students?
00:02:53 Sometimes we take it for granted
00:02:56 that such and such a Bible student is going to be there, and he doesn’t show up.
00:02:59 And later, we learn that he allowed
00:03:02 some trivial matter to interfere with his attendance.
00:03:06 A little extra encouragement won’t hurt.
00:03:10 Now, what about those who used to associate with us but who are inactive?
00:03:14 It seems to me that they fall into two categories.
00:03:17 You have some who would never miss the Memorial;
00:03:20 they appreciate what Christ has done, and they’re there.
00:03:24 And we love them, and we’re so glad to see them.
00:03:27 And then there’s a second group
00:03:29 who may feel that it’s hypocritical on their part
00:03:32 to attend the Memorial because they’ve missed every other meeting during the year.
00:03:35 Well, they have to start somewhere, don’t they?
00:03:38 So we want to give them
00:03:40 loving reassurance and a warm invitation to come.
00:03:44 And don’t forget unbelieving husbands
00:03:46 who might respond better to an invitation from an outsider than from their wife.
00:03:53 Friends, don’t underestimate the value
00:03:56 of a brief visit or a phone call to an inactive person.
00:04:01 Some time ago, on the day of the Memorial,
00:04:03 the visiting speaker and the coordinator of the body of elders
00:04:07 paid a visit to a brother who was inactive.
00:04:10 Now, that brother hadn’t attended a meeting
00:04:13 for 15 years, and yet before that,
00:04:16 he had been very active in the truth.
00:04:18 In fact, he’d enjoyed many privileges in the organization.
00:04:22 What did the brothers do?
00:04:24 They simply listened as the brother relived
00:04:27 the experiences he’d enjoyed when he was active,
00:04:31 and at the end of the conversation,
00:04:34 they simply said:  “We’d love to see you at the Memorial.
00:04:37 Won’t you come?”
00:04:39 The brother came.
00:04:41 Now, most in the congregation  didn’t know who he was,
00:04:44 but they gave him a warm welcome.
00:04:47 And you know what?
00:04:49 That was all it took.
00:04:51 That brother never looked back.
00:04:53 He was faithful to Jehovah for the rest of his life.
00:04:57 But now what about some of you dear ones
00:05:00 who have been asked to work secularly tonight?
00:05:02 You may be new on the job,
00:05:04 and maybe your boss has the reputation for being a bit inflexible.
00:05:09 You might say, ‘He’d never give me the time off.’
00:05:13 What to do?
00:05:15 Why not approach Jehovah in earnest prayer?
00:05:19 Tell him how you feel.
00:05:21 Ask him to touch the heart of your boss,
00:05:24 and ask him to help you to present your request respectfully
00:05:28 and in an appealing way.
00:05:31 You might be surprised at the outcome.
00:05:35 Jehovah’s servants have always taken the Memorial seriously.
00:05:40 Our brothers and sisters even observed it in concentration camps
00:05:44 and labor camps, such as this one in Mordoviya.
00:05:49 Following that pattern,
00:05:51 in our day, our young brothers who were imprisoned in Korea
00:05:54 didn’t allow prison bars to prevent them from keeping the festival.
00:05:59 In parts of Africa, interested ones may have to travel long distances
00:06:04 to get to the village or the city where the Memorial is going to be observed.
00:06:09 In Tanzania, a Bible student moved
00:06:12 to a remote area where there was no congregation.
00:06:16 The nearest congregation was more than 60 miles (97 km) away.
00:06:20 Now, to those in Western lands, that may not seem like much,
00:06:24 but in the area where he lived,
00:06:26 that was going to require a grueling eight-hour bus trip.
00:06:31 Why?
00:06:32 Number one: The roads were bad.
00:06:35 Number two: The bus made a lot of stops.
00:06:39 But he was there.
00:06:41 And after the meeting,
00:06:43 the man pleaded with the brothers to visit him
00:06:46 at least once a month so he could continue his studies.
00:06:49 Well, that man had put forth an effort to attend the Memorial,
00:06:52 so the congregation had to reciprocate.
00:06:55 And a few weeks later, a special pioneer couple visited him.
00:06:59 To their surprise, they found that the student
00:07:02 was already studying with 17 other people in the village.
00:07:08 How important is it to attend the Memorial?
00:07:11 In Congo, a traveling overseer and his wife
00:07:15 showed great determination to observe it.
00:07:17 They had to travel on a very bad road
00:07:20 to a congregation where the Memorial was going to be observed,
00:07:23 and the road was so bad that the motorcycle they were riding on broke down.
00:07:28 There was a defective part and no replacement available.
00:07:33 So the traveling overseer and his wife were stuck.
00:07:37 They were going to have to observe the Memorial right there,
00:07:40 at an unfamiliar village.
00:07:43 But there was a problem —no congregation and no brothers.
00:07:48 Undeterred, the brother went to the village chief
00:07:52 and explained the importance of the occasion,
00:07:54 and the chief responded.
00:07:56 He allowed the brother to observe the Memorial on his property,
00:08:00 and he even commissioned some young men to clean the place up
00:08:03 and build a platform for the speaker.
00:08:05 So now the location was ready, but you have to have an audience.
00:08:10 Well, the couple had invitations, and these were distributed in the village.
00:08:15 And as a result,
80 villagers attended the Memorial.
00:08:21 Now, of course, what’s a Memorial without music, without songs?
00:08:25 These people were not Witnesses; they didn’t know our songs.
00:08:29 But the traveling overseer’s wife was a good singer,
00:08:33 and so she helped the audience to sing the two Memorial songs.
00:08:38 Speaking of Africa, in Liberia, a congregation of 130
00:08:43 decided that they were going to do everything in their power
00:08:46 to invite many, many people to the Memorial.
00:08:49 So in the days leading up to the Memorial,
00:08:51 eight publishers worked from nine o’clock in the morning
00:08:55 till six o’clock at night distributing invitations.
00:08:58 Now, the Memorial was held in an open field.
00:09:01 And do you know how many attended? a congregation of 130?
00:09:06 Three thousand four hundred and ten.
00:09:11 In many places in Africa, it’s common
00:09:14 for a congregation of a hundred or more
00:09:16 to have an attendance into the thousands.
00:09:19 Well, you might say, ‘All right, that’s Africa,
00:09:22 but in our congregation, we’re not going to have a thousand people.’
00:09:25 But you are going to work just as hard
00:09:28 as our African brothers do,
00:09:30 and Jehovah is going to bless you just the same as he has blessed them.
00:09:37 In addition to inviting interested ones,
00:09:39 there is another thing all of us can do to get ready for the Memorial.
00:09:43 At 1 Corinthians 5:8, Paul wrote in part:
00:09:48 ‘So, then, let us keep the festival
00:09:52 with sincerity and truth.’
00:09:55 Now, whether we’re of the anointed or of the great crowd,
00:09:59 all of us should examine ourselves now
00:10:02 to see if we can do more to be pleasing to Jehovah.
00:10:05 Are we holding a grudge against a brother or a sister?
00:10:09 Now would be a good time to let it go.
00:10:13 Are we allowing some bad habit
00:10:15 to hold us back from making spiritual progress?
00:10:18 Now would be an excellent time to take decisive action against it.
00:10:25 “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”
00:10:29 That’s a command Jehovah’s Witnesses take very seriously.
00:10:33 So our prayer is
00:10:35 that Jehovah will bless your zealous efforts
00:10:38 to invite others to join us.
00:10:41 Now, Bill, will you please read today’s comment
00:10:44 from Examining the Scriptures?
00:10:47 “‘The builders,’ the Jewish leaders, rejected the Messiah.
00:10:52 “Their rejection was far more than just turning their backs on Jesus
00:10:57 “or refusing to accept him as the Christ.
00:11:00 “Many Jews rejected him to the point of clamoring for his death.
00:11:05 “Yes, they contributed to Jesus’ being killed.
00:11:10 “If Jesus was rejected and killed,
00:11:13 “how could he become ‘the chief cornerstone’?
00:11:16 “That could come about only
00:11:19 “by his being resurrected to life again.
00:11:22 “The apostle Peter spoke of ‘Jesus Christ the Nazarene,
00:11:26 “‘whom you executed on a stake
00:11:29 “but whom God raised up from the dead.’
00:11:33 “This resurrected Son thus became the only one
00:11:36 “whose name was ‘given among men
00:11:39 by which we must get saved.’”
00:11:44 Now please follow along as we enjoy today’s recorded Bible reading.
00:11:54 “On the first day of the Unleavened Bread,
00:11:57 “the disciples came to Jesus, saying:
00:12:00 “‘Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?’
00:12:04 “He said: ‘Go into the city to So-and-so
00:12:08 “‘and say to him, “The Teacher says:
00:12:11 “‘“My appointed time is near;
00:12:13 “I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.”’
00:12:18 So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover.”
00:12:28 “The day of the Unleavened Bread now arrived,
00:12:31 “on which  the Passover sacrifice must be offered;
00:12:34 “so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying:
00:12:38 “‘Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.’
00:12:42 “They said to him: ‘Where do you want us to get it ready?’
00:12:46 “He said to them: ‘Look! When you enter into the city,
00:12:51 “‘a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you.
00:12:55 “‘Follow him into the house that he enters.
00:12:58 “‘And say to the landlord of the house,
00:13:00 “‘“The Teacher says to you: ‘Where is the guest room
00:13:04 “‘where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’”
00:13:08 “‘And that man will show you a large, furnished upper room.
00:13:12 “Get it ready there.’
00:13:14 “So they left and found it just as he had told them,
00:13:18 and they prepared for the Passover.”
00:13:25 “When evening came,
00:13:27 “he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples.
00:13:30 “While they were eating, he said:
00:13:33 “‘Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.’
00:13:38 “Being very much grieved at this,
00:13:42 “each and every one began to say to him:
00:13:45 “‘Lord, it is not I, is it?’
00:13:49 “In reply he said:
00:13:52 “‘The one who dips his hand with me into the bowl
00:13:55 “‘is the one who will betray me.
00:13:58 “‘True, the Son of man is going away,
00:14:01 “‘just as it is written about him,
00:14:04 “‘but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed!
00:14:08 “It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.’
00:14:13 “Judas, who was about to betray him, replied:
00:14:18 “‘It is not I, is it, Rabbi?’
00:14:22 “Jesus said to him: ‘You yourself said it.’
00:14:28 “As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf,
00:14:32 “and after saying a blessing, he broke it,
00:14:35 “and giving it to the disciples, he said:
00:14:38 “‘Take, eat. This means my body.’
00:14:43 “And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, saying:
00:14:48 “‘Drink out of it, all of you,
00:14:51 “‘for this means my “blood of the covenant,”
00:14:54 “‘which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.
00:14:59 “‘But I say to you: I will by no means drink again
00:15:03 “‘any of this product of the vine until that day
00:15:06 “when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.’
00:15:11 “Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
00:15:17 “Then Jesus said to them: ‘All of you will be stumbled
00:15:21 “‘in connection with me on this night, for it is written:
00:15:25 “‘“I will strike the shepherd,
00:15:27 “‘and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.”
00:15:30 “‘But after I have been raised up,
00:15:33 “I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’
00:15:36 “But Peter, in response, said to him:
00:15:40 “‘Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, I will never be stumbled!’
00:15:45 “Jesus said to him: ‘Truly I say to you,
00:15:50 “‘on this night, before a rooster crows,
00:15:54 “you will disown me three times.’
00:15:58 “Peter said to him: ‘Even if I should have to die with you,
00:16:03 “I will by no means disown you.’
00:16:06 “All the other disciples also said the same thing.
00:16:12 “Then Jesus came with them to the spot called Gethsemane,
00:16:16 “and he said to the disciples:
00:16:18 “‘Sit down here while I go over there and pray.’
00:16:23 “And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebʹe·dee,
00:16:26 “he began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled.
00:16:31 “Then he said to them:
00:16:33 “‘I am deeply grieved, even to death.
00:16:38 “Stay here and keep on the watch with me.’
00:16:42 “And going a little way forward, he fell facedown, praying:
00:16:47 “‘My Father, if it is possible,
00:16:51 “‘let this cup pass away from me.
00:16:54 “Yet, not as I will, but as you will.’
00:17:01 “He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping,
00:17:04 “and he said to Peter:
00:17:07 “‘Could you not so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me?
00:17:12 “‘Keep on the watch and pray continually,
00:17:16 “‘so that you may not enter into temptation.
00:17:20 “The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.’
00:17:26 “Again, a second time, he went off and prayed:
00:17:30 “‘My Father, if it is not possible
00:17:33 “‘for this to pass away unless I drink it,
00:17:37 “let your will take place.’
00:17:39 “And he came again and found them sleeping,
00:17:44 “for their eyes were heavy.
00:17:47 “So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for a third time,
00:17:52 “saying once more the same thing.
00:17:55 “Then he returned to the disciples and said to them:
00:17:58 “‘At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting!
00:18:03 “‘Look! The hour has drawn near for the Son of man
00:18:07 “‘to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
00:18:11 “‘Get up, let us go.
00:18:13 “Look! My betrayer has drawn near.’
00:18:18 “While he was still speaking, look! Judas, one of the Twelve, came
00:18:23 “and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs,
00:18:27 “sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
00:18:31 “Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying:
00:18:36 “‘Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one;
00:18:40 “take him into custody.’
00:18:42 “And going straight up to Jesus, he said:
00:18:46 “‘Greetings, Rabbi!’
00:18:48 “and gave him a tender kiss.
00:18:52 “But Jesus said to him:
00:18:54 “‘Fellow, for what purpose are you present?’
00:18:59 “Then they came forward and seized Jesus and took him into custody.
00:19:04 “But look! one of those with Jesus reached out his hand
00:19:08 “and drew his sword and struck the slave
00:19:10 “of the high priest, taking off his ear.
00:19:14 “Then Jesus said to him:
00:19:16 “‘Return your sword to its place,
00:19:19 “‘for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
00:19:24 “‘Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father
00:19:28 “‘to supply me at this moment more than 12 legions of angels?
00:19:33 “‘In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled
00:19:36 “that say it must take place this way?’
00:19:40 “In that hour Jesus said to the crowds:
00:19:43 “‘Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber?
00:19:48 “‘Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching,
00:19:52 “‘and yet you did not take me into custody.
00:19:55 “‘But all of this has taken place
00:19:58 “for the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled.’
00:20:02 Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.”
00:20:09 It’s a joy to be associated with you.
00:20:12 And on behalf of the Governing Body,
00:20:14 I’d like to wish all of you a successful day
00:20:17 in Jehovah’s service and a blessed Memorial observance tonight.
00:20:21 Be assured that we love you all very much.
00:20:26 Now, let’s all get busy and see what we can do
00:20:31 to invite as many as possible to the Memorial.

00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:03.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This Morning Worship program is originating

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:09.655 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from world headquarters at Warwick, New York.

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers and sisters,

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:13.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a real privilege and pleasure

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak to all of you on this special day

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we observe the Memorial

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today’s text will remind us

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the unjust treatment
that he suffered at the hands of sinners.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have Brother William Malenfant here;

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bill is a helper to the Teaching Committee.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bill, will you read the text for us, please?

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Friday, April the 19th

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.770 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the Memorial date after sundown.

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The text is taken from Psalm 118:22:

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The stone that the builders rejected

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has become the chief cornerstone.”

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Bill.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Jesus was rejected
by the leaders of the Jewish nation,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what got into him
was having Jehovah’s approval.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, I love the way
the apostle Peter put it

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to 1 Peter 2:4.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter said that Jesus
was ‘rejected by men

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but precious to God.’

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’re the type of person
who gets a little bit upset

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re rejected at the doors
(maybe someone slams a door in your face),

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not just think about this phrase

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘rejected by men but precious to God’?

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Memorize it:
‘rejected by men but precious to God.’

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then think about it; it’ll help.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking of the ministry,
I thought I’d focus the rest of my comments

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the important work we all have to do today

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to invite as many as possible to the Memorial.

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have time off from work today,

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt you’ll be sharing in the ministry.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Bethel family members

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all over the world are going to be doing today.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whether you have time off or not,

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are things you can do to make sure

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:10.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that as many as possible
are in attendance tonight.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have to go to work or to school,

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not talk to a workmate or a schoolmate

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who you think would be willing

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the Memorial?

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be happy at the outcome.

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget to get in touch

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your Bible students and return visits today.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t forget to get in touch

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your Bible students and return visits today,

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if you’ve already invited them
to the Memorial.

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:42.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your return visits
might have misplaced the invitation,

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps they’ve forgotten what day it is.

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, those are the return visits,

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what about our Bible students?

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we take it for granted

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that such and such a Bible student
is going to be there, and he doesn’t show up.

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:02.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, we learn that he allowed

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:06.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some trivial matter
to interfere with his attendance.

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A little extra encouragement won’t hurt.

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about those who
used to associate with us but who are inactive?

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems to me that they fall into two categories.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:20.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have some
who would never miss the Memorial;

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they appreciate what Christ
has done, and they’re there.

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:27.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we love them,
and we’re so glad to see them.

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there’s a second group

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may feel that it’s hypocritical on their part

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:35.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the Memorial because they’ve missed
every other meeting during the year.

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:38.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they have to start somewhere, don’t they?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want to give them

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving reassurance
and a warm invitation to come.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget unbelieving husbands

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:52.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who might respond better to an invitation
from an outsider than from their wife.

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends, don’t underestimate the value

00:03:56.423 --> 00:04:01.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a brief visit or a phone call
to an inactive person.

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago, on the day of the Memorial,

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:07.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the visiting speaker
and the coordinator of the body of elders

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:10.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paid a visit to a brother who was inactive.

00:04:10.354 --> 00:04:13.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that brother hadn’t attended a meeting

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 15 years, and yet before that,

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:18.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had been very active in the truth.

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:22.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he’d enjoyed
many privileges in the organization.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the brothers do?

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They simply listened as the brother relived

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the experiences
he’d enjoyed when he was active,

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the end of the conversation,

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they simply said:
 “We’d love to see you at the Memorial.

00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:39.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Won’t you come?”

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother came.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, most in the congregation 
didn’t know who he was,

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:47.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they gave him a warm welcome.

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know what?

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was all it took.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brother never looked back.

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:57.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was faithful to Jehovah for the rest of his life.

00:04:57.568 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now what about some of you dear ones

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been asked to work secularly tonight?

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:04.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be new on the job,

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:09.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe your boss
has the reputation for being a bit inflexible.

00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:13.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say, ‘He’d never give me the time off.’

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What to do?

00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:19.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not approach Jehovah in earnest prayer?

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:21.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell him how you feel.

00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask him to touch the heart of your boss,

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:28.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask him to help you
to present your request respectfully

00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:31.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in an appealing way.

00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be surprised at the outcome.

00:05:35.814 --> 00:05:40.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s servants
have always taken the Memorial seriously.

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:44.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
even observed it in concentration camps

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:49.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and labor camps,
such as this one in Mordoviya.

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:51.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following that pattern,

00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our day, our young brothers
who were imprisoned in Korea

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:59.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t allow prison bars
to prevent them from keeping the festival.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In parts of Africa, interested ones
may have to travel long distances

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:08.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to the village or the city
where the Memorial is going to be observed.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Tanzania, a Bible student moved

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:16.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a remote area
where there was no congregation.

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:20.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The nearest congregation
was more than 60 miles (97 km) away.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to those in Western lands,
that may not seem like much,

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:26.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the area where he lived,

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:31.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going to require
a grueling eight-hour bus trip.

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:32.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:35.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one: The roads were bad.

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:39.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two: The bus made a lot of stops.

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:41.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was there.

00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:43.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after the meeting,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the man pleaded with the brothers to visit him

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least once a month
so he could continue his studies.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that man had put forth an effort
to attend the Memorial,

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:55.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the congregation had to reciprocate.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a few weeks later,
a special pioneer couple visited him.

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To their surprise, they found that the student

00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:07.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was already studying
with 17 other people in the village.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important is it to attend the Memorial?

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:15.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Congo, a traveling overseer and his wife

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed great determination to observe it.

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to travel on a very bad road

00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:23.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a congregation
where the Memorial was going to be observed,

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:28.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the road was so bad that the motorcycle
they were riding on broke down.

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:33.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a defective part
and no replacement available.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the traveling overseer
and his wife were stuck.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were going to have to observe
the Memorial right there,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at an unfamiliar village.

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:48.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a problem
—no congregation and no brothers.

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:52.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Undeterred, the brother went to the village chief

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explained the importance of the occasion,

00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:56.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the chief responded.

00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:00.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allowed the brother
to observe the Memorial on his property,

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:03.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he even commissioned
some young men to clean the place up

00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:05.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and build a platform for the speaker.

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:10.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now the location was ready,
but you have to have an audience.

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:15.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the couple had invitations,
and these were distributed in the village.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result,
80 villagers attended the Memorial.

00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:25.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course,
what’s a Memorial without music, without songs?

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:29.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These people were not Witnesses;
they didn’t know our songs.

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:33.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the traveling overseer’s wife
was a good singer,

00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:37.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so she helped the audience
to sing the two Memorial songs.

00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:43.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of Africa, in Liberia,
a congregation of 130

00:08:43.418 --> 00:08:46.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided that they
were going to do everything in their power

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:49.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to invite many, many people to the Memorial.

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:51.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the days leading up to the Memorial,

00:08:51.718 --> 00:08:55.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eight publishers worked
from nine o’clock in the morning

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:58.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
till six o’clock at night distributing invitations.

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:01.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Memorial was held in an open field.

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:06.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you know how many attended?
a congregation of 130?

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:11.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three thousand four hundred and ten.

00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:14.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many places in Africa, it’s common

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:16.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a congregation of a hundred or more

00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:19.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have an attendance into the thousands.

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:22.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might say, ‘All right, that’s Africa,

00:09:22.207 --> 00:09:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in our congregation,
we’re not going to have a thousand people.’

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:28.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you are going to work just as hard

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:30.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our African brothers do,

00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:35.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah is going to bless you
just the same as he has blessed them.

00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:39.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to inviting interested ones,

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:43.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is another thing all of us can do
to get ready for the Memorial.

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:48.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 5:8, Paul wrote in part:

00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:52.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So, then, let us keep the festival

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:55.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with sincerity and truth.’

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:59.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, whether we’re
of the anointed or of the great crowd,

00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:02.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us should examine ourselves now

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:05.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if we can do more
to be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:09.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we holding a grudge
against a brother or a sister?

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now would be a good time to let it go.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we allowing some bad habit

00:10:15.552 --> 00:10:18.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold us back from making spiritual progress?

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now would be an excellent time
to take decisive action against it.

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:29.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:33.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a command
Jehovah’s Witnesses take very seriously.

00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:35.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our prayer is

00:10:35.614 --> 00:10:38.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will bless your zealous efforts

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to invite others to join us.

00:10:41.203 --> 00:10:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Bill, will you please read today’s comment

00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:46.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Examining the Scriptures?

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:52.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The builders,’ the Jewish leaders,
rejected the Messiah.

00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:57.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their rejection was far more than
just turning their backs on Jesus

00:10:57.302 --> 00:11:00.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or refusing to accept him as the Christ.

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:05.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

to the point of clamoring for his death.

“If Jesus was rejected and killed,

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:16.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how could he become ‘the chief cornerstone’?

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That could come about only

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:22.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by his being resurrected to life again.

00:11:22.244 --> 00:11:26.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The apostle Peter spoke
of ‘Jesus Christ the Nazarene,

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘whom you executed on a stake

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:33.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whom God raised up from the dead.’

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:36.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This resurrected Son thus became the only one

00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whose name
was ‘given among men

00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:41.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by which we must get saved.’”

“On the first day of the Unleavened Bread,

for you to eat the Passover?’

00:16:42.814 --> 00:16:47.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And going a little way forward,

“He returned to the disciples
and found them sleeping,

“‘Could you not so much as
keep on the watch for one hour with me?

is eager, but the flesh is weak.’

“So leaving them,
he again went off and prayed for a third time,

“saying once more the same thing.

to the disciples and said to them:

“While he was still speaking,
look! Judas, one of the Twelve, came

a large crowd with swords and clubs,

“‘Greetings, Rabbi!’

“But look!
one of those with Jesus reached out his hand

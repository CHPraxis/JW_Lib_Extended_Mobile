Estimates vary,

00:00:03.153 --> 00:00:05.889 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but some say that the basic chemical elements

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:08.024 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that make up the human body

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:11.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
can be valued at as little as five dollars.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And that’s understandable

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.432 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when we read the description

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of man’s creation at Genesis 2:7.

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to this scripture.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read it, notice the materials

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used when he created man.

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 2:7 says:

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah God went on

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to form the man out of dust from the ground

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to blow
into his nostrils the breath of life,

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the man became a living person.”

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah took basic elements from the ground

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and formed them into a complex structure.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he added the breath of life

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and raised the value of that dust

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a level
that can be described only as priceless.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From five dollars worth of dust,

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God created a walking, talking,

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:08.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intelligent human made in God’s own image.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since man is made
from the dust of the ground,

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s fitting that the prophets
Jeremiah and Isaiah

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used the example of a potter molding clay

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:23.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to illustrate
our relationship with our Creator.

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s so much
we can say about this illustration,

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:28.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’d like to focus on three lessons

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can learn
from the potter and the clay.

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is be content.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:38.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be content
with how Jehovah molds and uses us.

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:42.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, be patient and endure.

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:46.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, cultivate an obedient heart.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider the first lesson:

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be content
with how Jehovah molds and uses us.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pottery making
is a highly treasured art form in Japan.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:02.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And depending on where the clay came from
and the methods used,

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the results can be very unique.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pottery made in the town of Bizen,
in western Japan,

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is called <i>bizen-yaki, </i>or Bizen ware,

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is noted for its earth tones

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fact that it is not glazed. 

00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:22.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Mashiko-yaki,</i>
made in the town of Mashiko, north of Tokyo,

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:25.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is colorful, and it is glazed.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each piece of pottery

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:31.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these different regions
has unique characteristics.

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:35.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter what the color, consistency,

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or origin of the clay,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final result is still a piece of pottery.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say
the same thing about Jehovah’s people.

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each one of us is custom-made.

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that we come
from 240 lands around the world.

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our physical features, our customs,

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our languages,
and our personalities vary greatly.

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we all have one thing in common:

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:05.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are all molded by the same Potter.

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah uses his Word, his holy spirit,

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his organization
to mold us into a desirable vessel,

00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:18.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may notice that a lump of clay
on the Potter’s wheel next to us

00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is taking a different shape.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s becoming a useful jar.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘She’s starting
to look like a beautiful vase.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just a plain old bowl.’

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s no reason
for us to be envious

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to become competitive.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we should be happy

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:42.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has
such a variety of loyal worshippers,

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all using their God-given gifts

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring him praise.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to 1 Corinthians chapter 12;

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll read verses 14, 17, and 18.

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we find the illustration

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:59.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the human body being used

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show the great variety of gifts

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have in the Christian congregation.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no reason
for us to be competitive.

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 12:14, 17, 18 reads:

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For, indeed, the body is made up

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:18.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not of one member but of many.”

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 17:

00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the whole body were an eye,

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where would the sense of hearing be?

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If it were all hearing,
where would the sense of smell be?

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now God has arranged

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of the body members just as he pleased.”

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jehovah is the Potter;

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are the clay.

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he will use each one of us

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that utilizes our strong points

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to do his will.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the second lesson,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please open your Bibles
to James chapter 1,

00:04:56.112 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 4.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:00.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture talks about the need

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to be patient or to endure.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:4 says:

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:09.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let endurance complete its work,

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be
complete and sound in all respects,

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not lacking in anything.”

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:20.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why do we need endurance
in order to be molded?

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, pottery making
is a time-consuming process,

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why the potter uses the wheel

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:29.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the clay spinning around and around,

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
repeatedly going over the same places.

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:35.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gradually, he gives the clay its shape.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,
even before putting the clay on the wheel,

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the potter washes it to remove any debris,
such as pebbles and sticks.

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he may tramp on it with his feet

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:49.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it pasty and malleable.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, he kneads it with his hands,
like kneading bread dough.

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, he places it
on the potter’s wheel.

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way,
before Jehovah can start to mold us,

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:05.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
major preparations are needed.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we start to learn the truth,

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have a lot of debris
mixed in with the clay.

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:13.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The debris may be personality traits,

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some form of wrong conduct,

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:19.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or false religious beliefs and practices.

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we correct these matters,

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we dedicate our lives to Jehovah,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he puts us on the wheel
to continue the molding process.

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:32.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that point,
we all are terribly out of shape,

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah patiently molds us

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a desirable vessel.

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us have been
in the molding process for decades;

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others just started in recent years.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter how long we’ve been spinning

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:50.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Great Potter’s wheel, we must endure

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain soft and pliable.

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:56.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cultivating an obedient heart

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to do this,

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is our third lesson.

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:05.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Solomon became king of Israel,

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:08.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made one request of Jehovah.

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s recorded at 1 Kings 3:9,
where he prayed:

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:15.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So grant your servant an obedient heart

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:20.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to judge your people,
to discern between good and bad.”

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having “an obedient heart”
means allowing Jehovah’s Word

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold our desires,
our affections, our emotions,

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our feelings, our motives, our goals in life.

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, much pottery is hollow,

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:41.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that means the potter has to put
his hands and fingers inside the clay

00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give it its proper form.

00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way,

God’s Word has to get into our hearts

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build us up from within.

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:56.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Psalm 143:10.

00:07:56.526 --> 00:08:01.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words of David
reveal a humble, teachable spirit

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us
to cultivate an obedient heart.

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 143:10 says:

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:12.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Teach me to do your will,
for you are my God.

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your spirit is good;
may it lead me on level ground.”

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there is much we can learn

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:22.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the illustration
of the potter and the clay.

00:08:22.618 --> 00:08:25.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, it teaches us contentment

00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the way Jehovah
is molding us and our fellow workers.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:32.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also shows us the need for endurance

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the need to cultivate an obedient heart.

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we continue to submit

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the gentle, loving hands
of our Great Potter.

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:47.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do that, sometime in the future,

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:49.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s going to stop spinning that wheel.

00:08:49.378 --> 00:08:53.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to look down
at what used to be five dollars worth of clay

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say with a smile, ‘Perfect!’

00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:59.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, on hearing that,

00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:02.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how happy we will be that,
like Isaiah, we said:

00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:05.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah, . . . we are the clay,

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you are our Potter.”

00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:02.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This morning we’re talking

00:00:02.152 --> 00:00:06.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the clever strategy of Satan,

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:10.093 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
designed to lure people away from Jehovah God.

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:13.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And so we’re going to examine two approaches:

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.299 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One he used

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the youngest intelligent creature
in the universe,

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other he used

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the oldest intelligent creature
in the universe.

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:30.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take the youngest first.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, that was Eve.

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So taking advantage of her inexperience,

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his purpose was to trick this woman

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:41.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to seduce her.

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how would he do it?

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we know, he was behind a serpent.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t want to show her who he really was

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what his aim really was.

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:53.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His choice of words also reveal a lot.

00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:57.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our text is Genesis chapter 3.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go there if you would.

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to just read his question again,

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 3:1:

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did God really say

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you must not eat
from every tree of the garden?”

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was his motive in asking this question?

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as was stated by one of the commenters,

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was trying to do

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to seed a doubt in her mind,

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:32.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
implying that Jehovah God
was holding something back from her.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He was too restrictive on you.’

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s interesting concerning questions.

00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The be book, Benefit From Theocratic
Ministry School Education,

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on page 66 says:

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some questions are like icebergs.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:53.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The most substantial part
lies hidden beneath the surface.

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An underlying issue
is often more important than the question itself.”

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the case of Eve,

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the question was asked,

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she didn’t see
the underlying purpose of the question.

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her answer in verses 2 and 3 indicate this.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:18.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said: “We may eat
of the fruit of the trees of the garden.

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God has said about the fruit of the tree
that is in the middle of the garden:

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You must not eat from it, no,
you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’”

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her answer was truthful,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was an honest, innocent answer.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Satan had her exactly where he wanted her.

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:43.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he was banking

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:46.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on her self-interest,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would be more interested in herself

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—her own needs—

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:54.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the love she had

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the God that gave
her everything that she had.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:01.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read his words again in verses 4 and 5.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan said: 
“You certainly will not die.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For God knows
that in the very day you eat from it,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your eyes will be opened
and you will be like God,

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing good and bad.”

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:16.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tragically, his gamble worked.

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had not cultivated

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the kind of love
and appreciation for Jehovah God

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:25.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she should have.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we learn from this example?

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:31.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if a perfect human can succumb

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this kind of reasoning
—irrational reasoning, really—

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can happen to any one of us.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God created us as free moral agents.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the way he made Eve.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t want robots.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to be able to think things through,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make the right choices,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decide between right and wrong.

00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is counting on us
to make the wrong choices.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what can we do
to counter that attack from Satan?

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have to know what is in our hearts.

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go to Hebrews 12:15, 16,

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul
gives a warning to his fellow Christians

00:04:16.472 --> 00:04:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against becoming people
who do not appreciate sacred things.

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:23.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s sort of the context

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of verses 15 and 16.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Carefully watch that no one

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“fails to obtain the undeserved kindness of God,

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that no poisonous root springs up

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to cause trouble and many are defiled by it;

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and watch that among you
there is no one who is sexually immoral

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor anyone
who does not appreciate sacred things.”

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is a need,
as he said here in verse 15,

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to: “Carefully watch.”

00:04:55.645 --> 00:05:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Carefully watch that no poisonous root
will spring up and contaminate the congregation.’

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “poisonous root”
refers to a few that may be in a congregation

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may find fault
with the way things are done,

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even find fault

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:15.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the direction Jehovah has given on matters

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:20.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe the sacredness of marriage
or the need for moral cleanness.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t want to be those kind of people
—obviously.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But tell me,
what’s necessary before a root can appear?

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a seed has to be planted,

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it germinates,
and then it grows into a root.

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s at the seed level

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:42.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to give special attention.

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to learn to identify

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these improper seeds, as it were.

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can do that for us
because they can’t read our heart.

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The seed may even—

00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve never even voiced what the seed is,

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it could be
in our thinking and in our heart.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these internal weaknesses
have to be addressed

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for fear we find ourselves in a circumstance

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:11.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maneuvered by Satan

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accentuate that particular weakness.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, James 1:14, 15
really describes the process well.

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:26.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:14, 15, where he says:

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each one is tried
by being drawn out and enticed

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:34.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by his own desire [own desire].

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:39.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the desire [the seed],

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when it has become fertile [starts to grow],

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gives birth to sin; in turn sin,

00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:48.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it has been carried out, brings forth death.”

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, being “enticed by his own desire.”

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:53.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that sound familiar?

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a powerful force.

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one that happened to Eve,

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the self-interests
—they’re similar.

00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:04.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?

00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we said earlier,
identify the seed or seeds

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that may be the case.

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:15.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let them germinate;
don’t let them start to grow.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:17.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rid ourselves of that thinking.

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:19.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if a “poisonous root”

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:21.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may happen to be in us

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or starting to grow,
then we need to rip it out.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:26.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may need to have help to do it.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be impossible
to remove a “poisonous root” by yourself.

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:35.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s spend a few moments
on the approach Satan used

00:07:35.304 --> 00:07:39.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the oldest intelligent creature in the universe,

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:41.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of course, Christ Jesus.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this case, he didn’t try to hide himself.

00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized there was no need to do that.

00:07:46.916 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew exactly who he was.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He understood the motive.

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:55.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so he just went overtly right to Jesus.

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you know, in the account of Matthew 4,

00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:03.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, ‘Look, just fall down
and do an act of worship to me.’

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does this tell us about Satan?

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:12.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he has long been driven by jealousy

over the worship that goes to Jehovah God.

00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:19.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s going to go to any length possible

00:08:19.382 --> 00:08:23.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to violate our worship to Jehovah God.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to pervert our worship to Jehovah God.

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if he has enough boldness

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to approach Jesus Christ,

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we know he will approach any one of us.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it makes no difference
how spiritually strong we look on the outside;

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:47.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will try to break our integrity.

00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:50.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the Bible reveals that Satan

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:55.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a deadly strategist in seeking his aims.

00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happily, though, we don’t have to be like Eve,

00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:01.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we know
the designs of Satan the Devil.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May each of us cultivate
the kind of love Jesus had for Jehovah God,

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we too can stand firm in our integrity.

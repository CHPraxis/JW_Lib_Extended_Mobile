00:00:02 Philippians 2:3:
00:00:04 “With humility consider others superior to you.”
00:00:08 These words, penned by the apostle Paul,
00:00:11 really reflect a message that Jesus
00:00:13 tried again and again
00:00:15 to get across to his apostles.
00:00:18 In fact, let’s look at one account at Mark 10:42, 43
00:00:25 —Mark 10:42.
00:00:29 It says: “But Jesus called them to him and said to them:
00:00:33 “‘You know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them
00:00:37 “‘and their great ones wield authority over them.
00:00:40 “‘This must not be the way among you;
00:00:43 “‘but whoever wants to be great among you
00:00:46 must be your minister.’”
00:00:48 “With humility consider others superior to you.”
00:00:52 Now, why was Jesus so concerned
00:00:55 that his disciples learn this lesson of humility?
00:00:58 Because Jesus knew that a lack of humility
00:01:02 is contrary to Jehovah’s personality.
00:01:05 If we don’t have humility, Jehovah’s holy spirit cannot flow.
00:01:08 Psalm 138:6 says that Jehovah
00:01:11 only knows the haughty “from a distance.”
00:01:14 But Jesus also knew that lack of humility
00:01:17 disrupts the peace of God’s people.
00:01:20 And without peace, Jehovah’s spirit cannot flow either.
00:01:24 We may think of 1 Corinthians 14:33
00:01:27 that says that Jehovah “is a God . . . of peace.”
00:01:30 Now, it’s of interest as we look at the accounts
00:01:33 that Jesus recognized that when his disciples lost their peace
00:01:37 —when they were arguing, when they were bickering among themselves—
00:01:41 it was because they were not applying the principle in today’s text.
00:01:45 Let’s look at another account.
00:01:47 If you look back a page to Mark 9:33,
00:01:54 it says: “And they came into Capernaum.
00:01:57 “Now when he was inside the house, he put the question to them:
00:02:00 ‘What were you arguing about on the road?’”
00:02:03 “What were you arguing about?”
00:02:05 Well, if you look at verse 34, they were quiet
00:02:07 because they were arguing about who was greater.
00:02:10 Now, think about this: These were grown men.
00:02:14 Do you really think they were walking down the road saying,
00:02:16 ‘Well, I’m greater than you are’; ‘no, I’m greater’; ‘no, I’m the greatest there is’?
00:02:19 Maybe, but maybe not. These were grown, mature men.
00:02:23 But Jesus, in his wisdom of human nature and being able to read hearts,
00:02:28 knew what they were arguing about —the root of it.
00:02:31 The topic didn’t matter.
00:02:32 The real issue was that it was a lack of humility.
00:02:36 And notice what he says in verse 35.
00:02:39 It says: “So he sat down and called the Twelve and said to them:
00:02:43 “‘If anyone wants to be first,
00:02:45 he must be last of all and minister of all.’”
00:02:49 Have humility.
00:02:50 Consider others superior to you.
00:02:54 At Luke 9:46, 47,
00:02:57 when there was a dispute, that account says
00:02:59 that “Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts,”
00:03:02 counseled them on humility.
00:03:04 He saw right through the argument —right through the issue—
00:03:07 and isolated the real problem:  lack of humility.
00:03:10 Now, when you think about it,
00:03:12 isn’t it true that that’s usually what is
00:03:15 behind petty arguments, disputes, or disagreements we may have?
00:03:20 See, if Jesus was among us, would he say:
00:03:22 ‘Come over here. What were you arguing about in the office?
00:03:26 What were you arguing about in the room?’
00:03:28 See, whether it’s between marriage mates,
00:03:31 those of us working together here at Bethel,
00:03:33 bodies of elders, publishers in the congregation,
00:03:36 what’s the lesson for us?
00:03:38 Well, the lesson is that when there seems to be a lack of peace
00:03:43 or when there seems to be tension or arguing,
00:03:45 the first person we should look at is ourselves.
00:03:49 Am I really arguing over who is greater?
00:03:53 Now, an account that always comes to mind when I think about this
00:03:55 is that of Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian maidservant.
00:03:58 And if you turn back to Genesis chapter 16,
00:04:02 (and we’re familiar with this account)
00:04:04 Sarah, or Sarai at the time, was not able to become pregnant.
00:04:08 Hagar became pregnant,
00:04:10 and as soon as Hagar became pregnant, peace went out of the family.
00:04:13 There was tension; there was bickering; there was arguing.
00:04:15 Things escalated to the point  of Sarai humiliating Hagar
00:04:19 and chasing her away into the wilderness.
00:04:21 We may first read this and say: ‘Oh, poor Hagar, this young pregnant girl.
00:04:25 Sarai is just jealous. Sarai has got the problem.’
00:04:28 Was that the case?
00:04:30 Well, we don’t have all the facts of the matter,
00:04:32 but it is of interest to note what Jehovah,
00:04:34 through his angel, told Hagar when he met up with her in the wilderness.
00:04:37 Look at Genesis 16:9.
00:04:42 It says: “Jehovah’s angel then said to her:
00:04:45 “‘Return to your mistress
00:04:47 and humble yourself under her hand.’”
00:04:51 ‘Go back, and be humble; and everything will be OK.’
00:04:55 Now, did you notice  what may have been the obstacle to peace?
00:04:58 Back in verse 4— Chapter 16, verse 4 says
00:05:01 that Hagar “began to despise her mistress”
00:05:04 when she, Hagar,  found out that she was pregnant.
00:05:06 The Byington translation says
00:05:08 that Hagar began to ‘look down on her mistress.’
00:05:12 Hagar began to feel that she was superior.
00:05:14 And what happened?
00:05:15 Yes, Sarah chased her away.
00:05:17 Hagar reacted, and perhaps Sarah reacted.
00:05:20 Perhaps Sarah did not react well either.
00:05:22 But do you notice who Jehovah held responsible for the lack of peace in the family?
00:05:27 Hagar.
00:05:28 ‘You go back  and humble yourself under her hand.’
00:05:32 And see, that’s a good account that reminds us that sometimes
00:05:35 the real underlying challenge to peace may be me.
00:05:40 See, peace may have gone away because of how people are reacting to me.
00:05:43 Perhaps I’m telegraphing that I think my ways, my ideas,
00:05:47 my way of doing things are superior to others.
00:05:50 Now, why is it so important that we fight this imperfect tendency
00:05:54 that we all have toward pride,
00:05:56 toward lacking humility, and feelings of superiority?
00:06:00 Well, not only is it distasteful to Jehovah but,
00:06:04 as we’ve talked about, lack of humility
00:06:07 disrupts the peace of God’s people.
00:06:10 And without peace, Jehovah’s spirit cannot flow.
00:06:14 Without Jehovah’s spirit, we’re on our own.
00:06:17 And if we’re on our own, we’re going to fail.
00:06:20 There’s a powerful quote in the Kingdom Rules! book
00:06:23 on page 120 in paragraph 9.
00:06:25 In fact, we have it written on one of the whiteboards in our office
00:06:28 just to remind us of this point.
00:06:31 It says this: “Any structure of order
00:06:34 “that does not have peace as its foundation
00:06:37 “will sooner or later collapse.
00:06:40 In contrast, godly peace promotes the kind of order that lasts.”
00:06:45 Powerful point, isn’t it?
00:06:47 “Any structure of order that does not have peace as its foundation
00:06:51 will sooner or later collapse.”
00:06:55 And see, that applies in the congregation,
00:06:57 in a family, in our department at Bethel,
00:07:00 on a construction site, wherever we are.
00:07:03 And I know in our work,
00:07:05 no matter how challenging or how complicated things get,
00:07:08 no matter what we’re dealing with, the only time we really start to worry
00:07:13 is when we find that peace has gone away.
00:07:15 Maybe there’s tension between ones in the office;
00:07:17 maybe there’s tension between our department and another department.
00:07:20 That’s when we worry, and we start working quickly
00:07:22 to see what we can do to restore peace.
00:07:24 Because when peace is present—
00:07:26 No matter how challenging or how hard the topic is, it’s just work.
00:07:30 And that’s why we’re here: We love to work.
00:07:32 But when peace is disturbed, that’s when we’re in trouble.
00:07:36 Now, how important is it to Jehovah that we consider others superior to us?
00:07:41 How important is it to Jehovah that we maintain peace?
00:07:44 How does he feel about that?
00:07:46 Well, let’s look at a scripture at Psalm 35:27.
00:07:53 Psalm 35:27 says:
00:07:59 “But let those who take pleasure in my righteousness shout joyfully;
00:08:04 “may they constantly say: ‘May Jehovah be magnified,
00:08:08 who takes pleasure in the peace of his servant.’”
00:08:13 Jehovah takes pleasure in the peace of his servants.
00:08:17 He takes pleasure when he sees us working together
00:08:20 in unity and in peace,
00:08:23 and that takes humility.
00:08:25 So may we work hard to always apply the principle in today’s text.
00:08:31 Consider others superior to us.
00:08:34 May we work hard to maintain the peace
00:08:36 of all of us all around us,
00:08:38 and may Jehovah never have to say of us,
00:08:42 ‘What were you arguing about on the road?’

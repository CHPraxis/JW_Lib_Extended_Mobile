00:00:07 Daily, millions of ants
00:00:10 travel from their nest to their hunting grounds
00:00:13 with nearly no congestion.
00:00:16 How?
00:00:19 When army ants leave their nests,
00:00:21 they navigate around those returning with food,
00:00:24 instinctively adjusting to the returning ants’ limited maneuverability.
00:00:29 When leaf-cutter ants encounter slow-moving,
00:00:32 load-carrying members, they adapt
00:00:35 by reducing speed, forming clusters,
00:00:38 and moving as a collective group.
00:00:40 Researchers say that this actually
00:00:42 helps ants reach their destination quicker,
00:00:44 as they will have the right-of-way
00:00:46 and avoid head-on collisions
00:00:48 with ants coming out of the nest.
00:00:50 Additionally, ants can communicate
00:00:52 by touching antennae, enabling them to overcome
00:00:55 even more complex navigational problems.
00:00:58 In contrast,  billions of hours each year are wasted
00:01:02 when individuals find themselves locked in traffic.
00:01:07 Scientists hope to mimic the ant’s instinctive adaptability
00:01:10 by designing traffic systems
00:01:13 that optimize vehicle flow
00:01:15 through changing road conditions.
00:01:18 What do you think?
00:01:19 Did the ant’s ability to avoid congestion
00:01:22 come about by evolution?
00:01:24 Or was it designed?

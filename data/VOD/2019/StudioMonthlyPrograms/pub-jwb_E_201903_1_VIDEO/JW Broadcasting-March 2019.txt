00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:03 Here are some highlights from the program:
00:00:06 How should we act when our Christian neutrality is put to the test?
00:00:12 Do you know where  to draw the line between being
00:00:15 a respectful observer and an active participant?
00:00:19 Join this family as these questions come up.
00:00:22 We’re confronted by the neutrality issue in all aspects of life.
00:00:27 What Bible principle should guide our thinking?
00:00:32 This month’s music video focuses
00:00:34 on the unity among our brothers and sisters.
00:00:37 As the world becomes more divided,
00:00:39 we become more united!
00:00:43 This is the March 2019 program  of JW Broadcasting!
00:01:07 We begin by traveling to the country of Armenia,
00:01:11 which is located in the Caucasus
00:01:13 —a region situated at the border of Europe and Asia.
00:01:18 Despite facing persecution for many years,
00:01:20 our brothers and sisters in Armenia
00:01:23 have remained loyal to Jehovah.
00:01:25 The story of Armenia
00:01:29 is a story of faith
00:01:32 —the faith of courageous brothers and sisters
00:01:35 who endured mob violence,
00:01:38 protests, and threats
00:01:40 from those who do not know God;
00:01:45 the faith of young brothers who were imprisoned
00:01:48 because they refused to compromise their neutrality;
00:01:52 and the faith of lawyers
00:01:55 who defended them when they were arrested.
00:01:59 In the early part of this period,
00:02:01 the work operated out of an office in a local brother’s home.
00:02:07 Today, the story is much different.
00:02:11 On May 14, 2016,
00:02:13 our brothers in Armenia were delighted to dedicate a group
00:02:17 of new facilities to accommodate future growth
00:02:20 —a branch facility
00:02:24 (mainly located on six floors of a local building),
00:02:29 a new Assembly Hall,
00:02:35 and also a school facility.
00:02:39 The dedication week started off with a welcome night,
00:02:42 where many traveled long distances to attend,
00:02:46 and some had not seen each other for a long time.
00:02:50 Well, we’ve never been to Armenia before,
00:02:52 and meeting the brothers and sisters was such an experience.
00:02:55 They gave us a really warm welcome.
00:03:00 When I was 90,
00:03:02 I decided, “No more Armenia.”
00:03:04 And now I’m 96, and Jehovah said,
00:03:08 “You’re going to Armenia.”
00:03:10 What a blessing!
00:03:14 It was amazing to see so many brothers and sisters from different countries,
00:03:17 and we enjoyed a very, very nice time with them.
00:03:21 Thanks to Jehovah, we really enjoyed this.
00:03:26 But the spiritual gems that we all enjoyed the most
00:03:29 were during the dedication program held at the end of the week.
00:03:35 The program was filled with reports and interviews
00:03:38 that touched our hearts,
00:03:41 and Brother Splane of the Governing Body gave the dedication talk.
00:03:46 Is it your desire to dedicate
00:03:48 the branch facilities, the Assembly Hall,
00:03:52 and the school facility to Jehovah today?
00:04:01 We could never have imagined such a thing happening five years ago.
00:04:04 From the time that we arrived at the airport
00:04:07 and we saw the brothers boldly holding up
00:04:09 the jw.org sign with their badges,
00:04:12 we were just so overwhelmed —so moved.
00:04:16 And I could feel as if I’m in the Paradise today
00:04:19 because we have so many guests from different countries,
00:04:23 and I could see their happy faces.
00:04:25 For many years, to be in courts
00:04:28 —in legal battles for our brothers as conscientious objectors
00:04:32 or to go to the court
00:04:35 for fighting a case for just one Kingdom Hall—
00:04:39 and suddenly to have a branch
00:04:42 and Assembly Hall and school facilities right away,
00:04:44 that’s for me kind of unbelievable.
00:04:47 Today is a great day
00:04:50 for Jehovah’s people in Armenia.
00:04:58 Truly, Jehovah has seen
00:05:01 the faithful obedience of our brothers and sisters in Armenia.
00:05:05 We have witnessed Jehovah ‘open the floodgates of the heavens
00:05:08 ‘and actually empty out a blessing
00:05:11 until there is no more want.’
00:05:13 Our theme this month is
00:05:16 “Christian Neutrality
00:05:18 “—What It Means, What It Takes,
00:05:21 and Why We Choose It.”
00:05:23 What is your opinion?
00:05:25 Where do you stand?
00:05:27 Can one person make a difference in countering injustice?
00:05:32 When we hear people discussing political topics,
00:05:35 we might at first think their conversation is purely philosophical;
00:05:39 but when injustice threatens our loved ones,
00:05:42 it can seem personal.
00:05:45 We expect that people will be divided over political ideology.
00:05:49 Revelation chapters 8-13  foretold that in the last days,
00:05:53 government would be the burning issue among mankind
00:05:58 and that people would feel pressured to take sides.
00:06:02 The question each of us needs to ask himself is,
00:06:05 How do I respond when people debate solutions to serious injustices?
00:06:11 As Christians, we’re most interested
00:06:14 in the example of Christ.
00:06:17 If ever there was a person who could make a difference in countering injustice,
00:06:20 it was Jesus.
00:06:22 He felt deep compassion for people.
00:06:25 And with his abilities to feed the hungry,
00:06:28 heal the sick, raise the dead, and reach hearts with his winsome words,
00:06:33 Jesus could have exerted invincible influence in the realm of politics.
00:06:38 He certainly had the opportunity to do so.
00:06:41 Satan was pleased to offer him
00:06:43 “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth”
00:06:45 in an exchange for one act of worship.
00:06:48 But Jesus wouldn’t accept it.
00:06:50 Neither did he assert that Satan had no authority to make such an offer.
00:06:55 Later, Jesus’ own countrymen tried to make him king,
00:06:59 but he rejected that too.
00:07:01 Later still, someone asked him
00:07:03 whether it was lawful to pay taxes to the Roman government.
00:07:07 Again, Jesus didn’t take sides.
00:07:11 He refused to become a world ruler,
00:07:14 a national leader, or a political activist.
00:07:18 Did that mean that Jesus didn’t care? that he had no opinion?
00:07:22 To the contrary!
00:07:24 Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.
00:07:27 And by treating people fairly,
00:07:29 Jesus promoted justice at the most fundamental level.
00:07:33 Still, his principal focus
00:07:36 was on teaching people about the Kingdom of God,
00:07:39 which would eliminate injustice for all time.
00:07:42 So, what did Jesus indicate should be our position
00:07:46 regarding human governments?
00:07:49 We learn from Jesus’ response to the question about Roman taxation
00:07:53 as recorded at Mark 12:15-17:
00:07:59 “‘Bring me a denarius to look at.’
00:08:02 “They brought one, and he said to them:
00:08:05 “‘Whose image and inscription is this?’
00:08:08 “They said to him: ‘Caesar’s.’
00:08:10 “Jesus then said:
00:08:12 “‘Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,
00:08:16 but God’s things to God.’”
00:08:19 What are Caesar’s things?
00:08:22 At Romans 13:1-7,
00:08:26 the apostle Paul lists tax, tribute,
00:08:29 fear, and honor.
00:08:32 Notice, too, that Jesus said to “pay back Caesar’s things.”
00:08:37 What does that imply?
00:08:39 That Caesar,  the ruling authority of the day,
00:08:41 had issued valuable things —coins, for example.
00:08:45 Thus, Caesar had the right to ask for some of those coins back.
00:08:50 This enabled the State to continue rendering necessary services.
00:08:54 Jesus acknowledged that.
00:08:57 On the other hand,
00:08:59 our most valuable possessions are grants from God himself
00:09:03 —such gifts as our heart, our life, our mind, and our strength.
00:09:08 We can’t give those things back to Caesar
00:09:11 because Caesar didn’t grant them to us in the first place.
00:09:13 We rightly give those things back to God
00:09:17 in the form of our dedication and our love.
00:09:21 Regarding our love for God, Jesus said at Mark 12:30:
00:09:27 “You must love Jehovah your God
00:09:30 “with your whole heart and with your whole soul
00:09:34 “and with your whole mind
00:09:36 and with your whole strength.”
00:09:40 So the love we give back to God is total
00:09:44 —no bodily part, function,
00:09:46 capacity, or desire being left out.
00:09:49 Those who love God take the side of Jesus,
00:09:54 whom Jehovah has appointed as King.
00:09:58 But how would Jesus’ disciples defend his Kingdom when people opposed it?
00:10:03 We gain insight from events that occurred
00:10:06 on the last night of Jesus’ life on earth.
00:10:09 Recall from Matthew chapter 26
00:10:12 that when “a large crowd with swords and clubs” came to arrest Jesus,
00:10:16 Peter “drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.”
00:10:22 John reports that the slave’s name was Malchus.
00:10:26 Luke adds that Jesus touched the man’s ear and healed him.
00:10:30 Imagine that!
00:10:32 Jesus bore no ill will toward the men taking him into custody.
00:10:36 Further, according to Matthew 26:52,
00:10:40 Jesus told Peter:
00:10:42 “Return your sword to its place,
00:10:45 “for all those who take up the sword
00:10:47 will perish by the sword.”
00:10:51 Why did Jesus disapprove of Peter’s brave act?
00:10:55 For the same reason that he had avoided the political process all the way up to that point.
00:11:00 Jesus explained this when he appeared before Pontius Pilate later that night.
00:11:05 At John 18:36, we read:
00:11:10 “My Kingdom is no part of this world.”
00:11:15 Yes, because Jesus’ Kingdom is not of human origin,
00:11:19 it doesn’t need human defenses.
00:11:22 How can we be sure that this is what Jesus meant?
00:11:26 Look closely at the rest of John 18:36:
00:11:30 “If my Kingdom were part of this world,
00:11:34 “my attendants would have fought
00:11:36 “that I should not be handed over to the Jews.
00:11:38 “But as it is, my Kingdom
00:11:41 is not from this source.”
00:11:44 So as Christians,
00:11:46 what is our position where political matters are concerned?
00:11:51 We are neutral.
00:11:53 Sometimes people misunderstand this viewpoint.
00:11:57 Some have concluded that because we don’t promote one human government,
00:12:01 that we must be promoting another human government.
00:12:04 In the 1950’s, in what is now the Republic of Congo,
00:12:08 authorities falsely accused Jehovah’s Witnesses of being Communists.
00:12:12 But during the 1970’s,
00:12:14 when Congo adopted a Communist form of government,
00:12:17 the new authorities found fault with us for not being Communists!
00:12:22 Today, however, and for nearly three decades,
00:12:24 Jehovah’s Witnesses have enjoyed legal status in the Republic of Congo.
00:12:28 And whereas some have perceived
00:12:31 our Christian neutrality as sheer apathy,
00:12:34 others construe our position as a threat.
00:12:38 Let’s address both of these viewpoints.
00:12:41 First, there is a big difference
00:12:44 between Christian neutrality and apathy.
00:12:47 Apathy is defined
00:12:49 as “a lack of interest, enthusiasm, or concern.”
00:12:52 We certainly don’t lack interest in people,
00:12:55 nor are we insensitive to their feelings.
00:12:57 Like Jesus, we strive to alleviate people’s suffering
00:13:00 by helping them in practical ways
00:13:03 while teaching them about the only Kingdom
00:13:05 that can eliminate injustice.
00:13:08 By teaching people from God’s Word,
00:13:10 we endeavor to change hearts,
00:13:12 not political institutions.
00:13:15 We feel this approach is realistic
00:13:17 because mankind’s main problems are not political
00:13:21 but moral.
00:13:24 But why can it be said that Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a threat
00:13:27 but, rather, an asset?
00:13:30 We conscientiously obey the laws,
00:13:32 we support our communities through volunteer service
00:13:35 or compulsory civilian service where that exists,
00:13:39 and we pay our taxes.
00:13:41 It’s true, we don’t vote for political parties or candidates,
00:13:46 but neither do we disrupt elections
00:13:48 or interfere with those who choose to vote.
00:13:50 It’s true, we don’t lobby, campaign, or run for government office,
00:13:54 but neither do we criticize those in power,
00:13:57 undermine their policies, or demonstrate for political change.
00:14:01 It’s true, we won’t salute a flag,
00:14:04 but neither will we burn a flag, spit on a flag,
00:14:07 or disparage the nation that a flag represents
00:14:10 —even in lands where these are considered
00:14:13 protected expressions of freedom.
00:14:16 It’s true, we don’t sing national anthems,
00:14:19 but neither do we discourage others from singing,
00:14:21 nor do we make a public spectacle of not singing;
00:14:25 we simply don’t participate.
00:14:28 It’s true, we wouldn’t kill people in war,
00:14:31 but neither would we attack people at home.
00:14:34 So while we don’t promote any political position,
00:14:37 neither do we condemn any political position —even in our heart.
00:14:41 That is what neutrality means.
00:14:45 We don’t take sides.
00:14:48 But what if the demands of the State
00:14:51 conflict with the commands of Jesus?
00:14:55 There’s a Bible principle for that.
00:14:58 Are you thinking  of what it says at Acts 5:28, 29
00:15:02 —that “we must obey God as ruler rather than men”?
00:15:07 This is not disregard for the State,
00:15:10 but, rather, reverence for God.
00:15:13 If the State demands that we do what God forbids
00:15:16 or refrain from doing what God commands,
00:15:19 then we believe God would consider that an invalid request.
00:15:25 Now, one might say,
00:15:27 ‘I can imagine some situations where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.’
00:15:32 Jesus foretold as much at Matthew 24:9,
00:15:36 where he said: “You will be hated by all the nations
00:15:40 on account of my name.”
00:15:43 More specifically, at Revelation 2:10,
00:15:45 Jesus said that some of his disciples would be thrown into prison
00:15:50 —not all of us but some.
00:15:53 So we’re not disappointed if we don’t get thrown into prison,
00:15:57 but neither are we discouraged if we do.
00:16:00 Our minds turn to the thousands of brothers and sisters
00:16:03 who have been sentenced to prison over the years
00:16:05 for their Christian neutrality.
00:16:08 We are proud of them. We pray for them.
00:16:11 We know that Jehovah is pleased with them.
00:16:15 Their endurance under trial spells victory for all of us.
00:16:19 How so?
00:16:21 To the congregation in Ephesus, Paul wrote:
00:16:27 “I ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations in your behalf,
00:16:31 for these mean glory for you.”
00:16:36 Paul wrote these words while he himself was under house arrest in Rome.
00:16:41 In what sense did Paul’s tribulations
00:16:44 “mean glory” for the Ephesians?
00:16:47 In that his perseverance in ministering despite trials
00:16:50 showed the congregation that the privileges they enjoyed as Christians
00:16:54 were of the highest importance.
00:16:56 If Paul had just given up, what would that have implied?
00:17:01 That their faith, their ministry,
00:17:03 and their hope in God’s Kingdom were not so valuable after all.
00:17:07 Instead, Paul’s endurance exalted Christianity.
00:17:11 It demonstrated that remaining faithful is worth any sacrifice.
00:17:16 In like manner, the endurance of our dear brothers and sisters in prison
00:17:20 proves that their hope is alive
00:17:22 and that the Kingdom they represent is real.
00:17:26 They have an identity as envoys,
00:17:30 not of any human government,
00:17:32 but of the heavenly Kingdom
00:17:34 —a Kingdom that will reward them with everlasting life
00:17:38 in a world without war.
00:17:42 Whether we face imprisonment or not,
00:17:45 how prepared are we to remain neutral in our day-to-day life?
00:17:49 In this dramatization, a Christian family discovers
00:17:53 that they need to spend more time studying about the subject of neutrality.
00:17:59 Collette, I’m home.
00:18:01 In the kitchen, Curtis.
00:18:03 How was your day?
00:18:05 Oh, it was a long day, but it’s nice being home.
00:18:07 That smells amazing! I can’t wait.
00:18:09 Oh, well, it will be ready in a few minutes.
00:18:10 But I have a surprise;
00:18:12 my job gave us tickets to the game this weekend
00:18:16 —enough for all of us to go.
00:18:18 So it’s downtown at the . . .
00:18:19 That sounded like fun.
00:18:21 It was a sport we could enjoy watching.
00:18:23 Collette and I hadn’t been in years,
00:18:25 and I don’t think the kids had ever gone.
00:18:33 We were all looking forward to a family night out.
00:18:40 But, Dad, what exactly do we do during the national anthem?
00:18:46 Honestly, I wasn’t sure.
00:18:48 Ladies and gentlemen,
00:18:50 would you please stand for the singing
00:18:52 of our national anthem?
00:19:01 Dad, I have a question too.
00:19:05 Will they salute the flag at my new school?
00:19:07 That’s right.
00:19:09 The conference with her teachers was next week,
00:19:12 and we didn’t know what they’d do there.
00:19:13 OK, class. Now that everyone is here,
00:19:15 let’s all stand for the pledge of allegiance.
00:19:21 Elizabeth, is everything all right?
00:19:25 What do you think, Honey?
00:19:29 Well, tomorrow night is our Family Worship evening.
00:19:33 So why don’t we do a study project as a family
00:19:36 on Christian neutrality at public events?
00:19:39 That sounds like a good idea.
00:19:40 Yeah.
00:19:41 I think this will be great. We’ll all get a chance to do our research.
00:19:47 I asked Daniel to research Christian principles on neutrality.
00:19:52 Collette and Elizabeth would find examples
00:19:55 of ones who proved loyal under pressure.
00:20:00 And for me,
00:20:02 my job was to call Elizabeth’s new school
00:20:04 to find out if they saluted the flag or sang the anthem.
00:20:09 Hello.
00:20:10 Hi, Mr. Johnson? This is Curtis, Elizabeth’s dad.
00:20:15 We’d studied this topic when the kids were younger,
00:20:18 but we needed reminders for these new challenges.
00:20:21 The kids found some great information.
00:20:26 Several Bible principles applied.
00:20:28 But what Jesus said at Matthew 4:10
00:20:31 was an essential foundation:
00:20:34 “It is Jehovah your God you must worship,
00:20:37 and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”
00:20:42 If we participate in a nationalistic ceremony,
00:20:46 we’re sharing in worship
00:20:47 of something or someone other than Jehovah God.
00:20:51 But what would help us know what to do?
00:20:55 Elizabeth found some good examples to imitate.
00:20:59 The account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
00:21:01 was one of our favorites.
00:21:04 When King Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to worship the gold image,
00:21:07 they bravely stood while others bowed down.
00:21:11 They were determined to worship only Jehovah,
00:21:16 and He rescued them from the furnace.
00:21:19 And there are modern-day examples
00:21:21 of courage like the three Hebrews.
00:21:23 Some children have had to take a stand
00:21:26 when governments tried to force them
00:21:28 to take part in patriotic events during wartime,
00:21:31 when feelings of national pride ran strong.
00:21:35 And despite legal victories in some countries,
00:21:38 young ones today are still put to the test.
00:21:42 We learned there was no one answer on what to do.
00:21:46 Situations are different depending on where we live
00:21:50 or what a person does to show he’s participating.
00:21:53 But in every case,
00:21:55 Christians in some way make it evident
00:21:58 that they are respectful observers, not participants.
00:22:03 We felt good because we had decided
00:22:06 what we would do to be respectful but neutral
00:22:09 and show Jehovah that our family worships him alone.
00:22:15 Since the tests of our neutrality differ depending on where we live,
00:22:19 why not do what the family in the video did
00:22:22 —devote a Family Worship evening or personal study session to researching
00:22:27 how to avoid participating inadvertently
00:22:30 in any activity that would violate our Christian neutrality.
00:22:35 The subject of neutrality was highlighted in a Watchtower article that we studied
00:22:39 in the congregations in 2016.
00:22:43 In this first episode of a new video series
00:22:46 called Lessons From the Watchtower,
00:22:49 note how our brothers and sisters have applied
00:22:51 the admonition found in that very practical article.
00:23:08 As a professor of finance, I need to be well-informed.
00:23:10 As a Christian, I also need to be well-informed,
00:23:13 as do all Christians.
00:23:15 It’s difficult not to take sides in politics.
00:23:18 It’s very difficult because we are aware of the issues.
00:23:22 I always really liked soccer ever since I was little.
00:23:25 I lived in a poor area, and soccer was what we used to do for fun.
00:23:31 There was a journalist that I liked to keep up with.
00:23:34 He would point out both the good and the bad on all sides of politics.
00:23:38 But when he spoke up and pointed out only the bad side of a political party,
00:23:42 I did not like that.
00:23:46 I live in the downtown area of the city.
00:23:49 That is where the largest political demonstrations take place.
00:23:53 People from this area are really into politics.
00:23:55 They have definite opinions.
00:23:57 And even though I always knew that we must remain neutral,
00:24:00 I secretly approved of the demonstrations.
00:24:05 On the outside, I wasn’t jumping up and down or cheering,
00:24:09 but on the inside, I was saying: ‘Come on! Let’s win!’
00:24:13 It was all about the desire, the crowd,
00:24:16 and the pride of your team having the most victories or the most trophies.
00:24:21 I used to rationalize saying:
00:24:23 “I was created in Jehovah’s image, and Jehovah is a just God.”
00:24:26 What was speaking was my sense of justice.
00:24:29 I thought neutrality was shown through actions
00:24:31 and not through what I felt.
00:24:34 The April 2016 Watchtower
00:24:37 has interesting information regarding neutrality.
00:24:40 Being neutral means that you do not consider yourself better than others
00:24:44 because “in God’s sight, all people are equal.”
00:24:47 After studying the article, I realized that I needed to make changes;
00:24:52 I was not being neutral.
00:24:54 So I read the article again.
00:24:55 I prayed to Jehovah;
00:24:57 I said to him that I knew it was as if he were speaking to me.
00:25:00 The magazine really touched me deeply.
00:25:04 I remember reading the article at least three times that evening.
00:25:08 I was really surprised.
00:25:10 I realized how far off I was
00:25:13 from what God wanted me to be on the inside.
00:25:16 The second situation mentioned in the article
00:25:19 had to do with news reports and the media.
00:25:21 The article even suggested that we limit
00:25:23 our intake of news that we watch related to politics.
00:25:28 There was another phrase that really moved me.
00:25:30 It said: ‘Even if we don’t march with protesters,
00:25:33 might we be with them in spirit?’
00:25:35 Yes! I was with them. Yes!
00:25:37 There were several phrases in that article
00:25:40 that were written just for me.
00:25:44 When I cut back watching so many news reports
00:25:47 —and I had to—
00:25:49 this helped me to have self-control when I spoke to others at work.
00:25:54 When workmates mentioned something that was in the news,
00:25:57 I didn’t have anything to say since I hadn’t seen it.
00:25:59 I didn’t know about it.
00:26:01 A workmate would say: “Did you see that so-and-so said this
00:26:05 and that someone else made a statement?”
00:26:07 I would say: “No, I didn’t see it,”
00:26:09 and that was the end of the conversation.
00:26:11 The article mentions Romans 10:12
00:26:14 which says that Jehovah is “Lord over all” of us,
00:26:16 that ‘there is no difference between Jew and Greek.’
00:26:20 To Jehovah, it’s not important if my country
00:26:22 has five or six titles or if it won or lost the World Cup.
00:26:26 To Jehovah, all people are equal.
00:26:30 I took a piece of paper, just a simple piece of paper,
00:26:34 and I wrote on it the four key points that the article talks about
00:26:38 —four key points that will help us to remain neutral.
00:26:43 I keep it in my purse; that way I can always read it at work.
00:26:49 I like watching soccer; it’s fun.
00:26:52 I still watch it on TV.
00:26:54 I still play soccer with my friends at Bethel,
00:26:57 but I’ve made an effort to change.
00:27:00 Little by little, I’ve managed to put soccer in its proper place.
00:27:06 This helps me to keep pride and nationalism from getting the best of me.
00:27:11 I learned from this article not to express opinions about politics.
00:27:15 That has to come from deep inside.
00:27:18 If I’m convinced that God’s Kingdom is the best solution
00:27:21 and that there’s nothing that comes even close,
00:27:23 remaining neutral will come naturally.
00:27:26 But I can’t let my guard down.
00:27:29 I really enjoy studying articles from The Watchtower,
00:27:32 especially those dealing with practical matters.
00:27:34 They help me see the Bible as if it were a mirror that shows me where I can improve.
00:27:38 Following counsel
00:27:40 and making the changes suggested in the article
00:27:43 has helped me to speak with the conviction
00:27:45 that only the Kingdom can solve mankind’s problems.
00:28:03 Because our enemy Satan tries to break our integrity in many subtle ways,
00:28:08 it’s important to know ahead of time how we’ll act.
00:28:13 Actions are important, and yet they’re preceded by thoughts,
00:28:18 as one young brother discovered.
00:28:20 In this dramatization, note what Bible principle
00:28:24 helped him to stay neutral in his heart.
00:28:45 “They are no part of the world.” —John 17:16.
00:28:50 “We must remain neutral in order to be loyal subjects of God’s Kingdom.
00:28:53 “Otherwise, how could we have a clean conscience
00:28:55 “when we preach the good news
00:28:57 “that only God’s Kingdom can solve mankind’s problems?
00:28:59 “. . . As Satan’s system nears its end,
00:29:01 we can expect the issue of neutrality to become more prominent.”
00:29:07 OK, people, we’re ready to go.
00:29:09 Dawn, Jordan, can I get you to grab the blinds please?
00:29:25 In your work groups this week, you’ll outline the policies
00:29:28 you feel world governments should implement.
00:29:31 Remember, it’s young people like you,
00:29:35 each of you, who must take action to solve the problems that threaten our planet.
00:29:59 When war comes, they’ll look for you and me to do the fighting.
00:30:02 Will you speak up and tell them, ‘No, no, we won’t?’
00:30:20 But I’m more worried about the elections, especially for your generation.
00:30:24 I mean, who do you think is going to win?
00:30:27 Uhm, well, we believe that—
00:30:30 uhm . . .
00:30:32 That’s actually a very interesting question.
00:30:34 And as Jehovah’s Witnesses, we believe that it’s God’s Kingdom
00:30:38 that’s going to bring about all the solutions that we need for all of our problems.
00:30:41 For example, . . .
00:30:42 That’s £7.50, please.
00:30:44 Thank you.
00:30:47 Hello, how can I help you?
00:30:50 But you know, this new government policy
00:30:53 —I really think it’s going to work.
00:30:55 You’re crazy.
00:30:57 With their policies, we’ll be bankrupt within three years.
00:31:00 But if it works, though, it’s going to make people rich.
00:31:03 Those who are rich already.
00:31:04 No, I’m fed up. They say the same thing.
00:31:23 We’ve invited a panel of experts to explore these issues,
00:31:27 namely, can the opposition party win?
00:31:30 Will they keep their promises to lower-income people?
00:31:33 And what changes could we expect on required military service?
00:31:37 You’ll want to hear the answers.
00:31:39 Let’s begin by speaking to John McGarthy, the minister of education.
00:31:42 If put to the test,
00:31:44 I do want to take my stand for Jehovah.
00:31:48 But the outcome of all these things can affect me now
00:31:51 —my family, my goals.
00:31:55 How can I stay neutral, even in my heart?
00:32:02 John 17:14:
00:32:09 “I have given your word to them,  but the world has hated them,
00:32:13 “because they are no part of the world,
00:32:16 “just as I am no part of the world.
00:32:18 “I do not request that you take them out of the world,
00:32:22 “but that you watch over them because of the wicked one.
00:32:26 “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.
00:32:30 “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.
00:32:34 “Just as you sent me into the world,
00:32:37 “I also sent them into the world.
00:32:39 “And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf,
00:32:43 so that they also  may be sanctified by means of truth.”
00:32:48 No part of the world,
00:32:50 like Jesus, both in thought and action.
00:32:58 Sure, but in our lifetime?
00:33:00 Yes! And I have found something that has helped me to be sure of this.
00:33:03 Can I share it with you?
00:33:05 It’s here at Matthew 24:33.
00:33:08 Jesus said: “Likewise also you, when you see all these things,
00:33:12 know that he is near at the doors.”
00:33:27 Our being neutral today is urgent
00:33:29 because Jehovah’s day is coming quickly.
00:33:32 On that day, we must be absolutely certain
00:33:36 that we are on Jehovah’s side.
00:33:38 In this Bethel morning worship,
00:33:40 Brother Anthony Morris of the Governing Body
00:33:43 explains why we don’t need to worry about the events to come.
00:33:47 Now, The Watchtower
00:33:49 from where the comments are taken
00:33:51 had the theme
00:33:53 “Your Deliverance Is Getting Near.”
00:33:56 Now, this was a sobering and yet
00:34:00 a very encouraging  Watchtower study article,
00:34:03 and that theme  was taken from Luke chapter 21.
00:34:07 So if you’d like to find that —Luke 21—
00:34:11 and in the context prior to verse 28,
00:34:16 we know verse 26:  “People will become faint out of fear
00:34:20 “and expectation of the things
00:34:22 coming upon the inhabited earth.”
00:34:25 Then it mentions “the heavens . . . shaken,”
00:34:29 then, “see the Son of man.”
00:34:31 And here’s where  we find the theme, verse 28:
00:34:34 “But as these things start to occur,
00:34:38 “stand up straight and lift up your heads,
00:34:42 because your deliverance is getting near.”
00:34:47 Now, as we know,  this is fulfilled during the great tribulation.
00:34:53 That’s something to keep in mind,
00:34:55 that at that time  when these events take place,
00:35:00 they’ll be able to stand up
00:35:03 and look forward to their deliverance.
00:35:06 Now, for a moment, just reflect back
00:35:09 on the Hezekiah video
00:35:12 that we enjoyed
00:35:14 during the convention season last year.
00:35:17 It was amazing!
00:35:19 And what a beautiful job  the brothers did in Audio/Video
00:35:22 depicting one angel
00:35:26 that destroyed 185,000 men.
00:35:30 It was spectacular!
00:35:32 However, find Revelation chapter 17
00:35:38 —Revelation chapter 17—
00:35:41 and this is what
00:35:44 is foretold for the near future.
00:35:48 The context here at Revelation 17,
00:35:51 where verse 12 mentions “the ten horns,”
00:35:53 and then down into verse 13
00:35:56 —after this “one hour with the wild beast” (the United Nations)—
00:36:01 they give their “authority to the wild beast.”
00:36:03 Humans in general  would find that hard to believe
00:36:07 when they look  at what’s going on in the world today.
00:36:10 But here’s what they’re going to do,
00:36:13 verse 14:
00:36:15 “These will battle with the Lamb,
00:36:19 “but because he is Lord of lords  and King of kings,
00:36:23 “the Lamb will conquer them.
00:36:26 “Also, those with him
00:36:29 who are called and chosen  and faithful will do so.”
00:36:34 Now,
00:36:36 as good as our brothers are in Audio/Video,
00:36:39 I personally doubt that anyone
00:36:42 could do a videography  and capture this event.
00:36:47 You’re talking about Christ Jesus,
00:36:50 the 144,000
00:36:52 anointed immortal spirit creatures,
00:36:56 and then Jesus has the holy angels
00:36:59 that are under his direction as King.
00:37:02 This is going to be spectacular!
00:37:04 Now, all things are possible with God,
00:37:06 but I think they’d have to have Him  to be able to show a video
00:37:11 to capture what’s coming in the future.
00:37:15 Just spectacular!
00:37:17 Now, just keep in mind  (and The Watchtower made this clear),
00:37:20 we don’t know the sure  and exact sequence of events
00:37:24 —the time order— some of it (as The Watchtower says)
00:37:27 will likely overlap.
00:37:30 However, what we do know
00:37:32 —Jehovah has been kind about this—
00:37:35 is what’s going to take place
00:37:38 to start the great tribulation.
00:37:41 Now, we find here in verse 15,
00:37:44 and we’ll read  through verse 17 of Revelation 17:
00:37:48 “He said to me: ‘The waters that you saw,
00:37:51 “‘where the prostitute is sitting,
00:37:53 “‘mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.
00:37:57 “‘And the ten horns  that you saw and the wild beast,
00:37:59 “‘these will hate the prostitute
00:38:02 “‘and will make her devastated and naked,
00:38:05 “‘and they will eat up her flesh
00:38:07 and completely burn her with fire.’”
00:38:11 Now, here’s the fact
00:38:13 and verification for why this will happen,
00:38:17 verse 17: “For God put it into their hearts
00:38:20 “to carry out his thought,
00:38:23 “yes, to carry out their one thought
00:38:25 “by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,
00:38:28 until the words of God will have been accomplished.”
00:38:31 So it’s as good as done.
00:38:34 This is what’s going to happen
00:38:36 regardless of how people view us
00:38:39 when we preach this good news.
00:38:42 Because this is good news —the destruction
00:38:44 of the world empire of false religion,
00:38:47 the beginning of the great tribulation.
00:38:49 This is spectacular news for God’s people,
00:38:52 and until it takes place, they won’t believe it.
00:38:57 But it will happen because  Jehovah says it’s going to happen.
00:39:00 So that’ll be a time for us  to prove our love for Jehovah God.
00:39:05 We’ll be the only group protected by him.
00:39:09 Now, this was profound, too,
00:39:11 this article in The Watchtower made this—
00:39:14 I thought it was  a profound statement when you think
00:39:17 about the organization we’re a part of.
00:39:20 It said in paragraph 9:
00:39:23 “This will not be the time to preach
00:39:26 the ‘good news of the Kingdom.’”
00:39:28 My, we’re a preaching organization.
00:39:32 So there’s a time  we’ll not preach the good news?
00:39:35 Yes.
00:39:37 Remember one of our favorite verses?
00:39:40 It’s etched on the minds  and hearts of God’s people:
00:39:43 “And this good news  of the Kingdom will be preached
00:39:46 in all the inhabited earth  for a witness to all the nations.”
00:39:49 Well, don’t forget the last part:
00:39:52 “And then the end will come.”
00:39:55 So during the great tribulation —no good news.
00:40:00 However, we do know there’ll be preaching.
00:40:04 And you think we’re unpopular now?
00:40:08 Oh, my!
00:40:10 Notice Revelation chapter 16,
00:40:14 and in the context  Armageddon is being addressed,
00:40:18 and notice verse 21:
00:40:22 “Then great hailstones,  each about the weight of a talent,
00:40:26 “fell from heaven on the people,
00:40:28 “and the people blasphemed God
00:40:31 “because of the plague of [the] hail,
00:40:33 for the plague was unusually great.”
00:40:37 Yes.
00:40:38 So the message and the preaching
00:40:41 are going to be like “hailstones.”
00:40:44 I don’t know if you’ve  ever been in a hailstorm,
00:40:46 but this is a huge hailstorm
00:40:51 being depicted here.
00:40:53 It’s likely, possibly, a hard-hitting message
00:40:57 —maybe a declaration  announcing that Satan’s world
00:41:00 is about to come to a complete end.
00:41:04 So let’s just stay tuned.
00:41:08 And don’t feel bad—I know.
00:41:10 I was out in the ministry
00:41:12 in one territory recently,
00:41:17 and it’s good to suffer reproach.
00:41:19 We all need that, like Jesus did.
00:41:21 The door-to-door ministry  is good for us.
00:41:24 But see, if you think  we’re suffering reproach now—
00:41:28 Well, get ready!
00:41:29 It’s just training for this future declaration
00:41:33 that we’ll have the privilege to share in.
00:41:35 Now, keep in mind
00:41:37 that there is this event that The Watchtower
00:41:40 did mention in Matthew chapter 24.
00:41:43 And if you’ll find that,
00:41:45 it’s nice to have this clear.
00:41:49 Matthew chapter 24,
00:41:52 and we’re going to read verse 31:
00:41:58 “And he will send out his angels
00:42:01 “with a great trumpet sound,
00:42:03 “and they will gather  his chosen ones together
00:42:06 “from the four winds,
00:42:08 from one extremity of the heavens  to their other extremity.”
00:42:13 So, what The Watchtower stated there was
00:42:16 that it’s not the initial gathering
00:42:18 of the anointed nor the final sealing;
00:42:20 this is when the remnant —the remaining ones—
00:42:23 receive their heavenly reward  during the great tribulation.
00:42:27 And this event takes place at some point
00:42:30 after the beginning of the attack by Gog.
00:42:34 Now, at that time,
00:42:36 that’s when Matthew 13:43 is fulfilled:
00:42:39 “The righteous ones  will shine as brightly as the sun
00:42:43 in the Kingdom of their Father.”
00:42:46 So as we mentioned —sobering, yes, but encouraging.
00:42:51 Oh, yes, so encouraging.
00:42:53 So, brothers, let’s be confident;
00:42:56 let’s trust in Jehovah.
00:42:58 There’s no need to be afraid.
00:43:01 Let’s keep up our spiritual routine
00:43:04 and prove ourselves ready,
00:43:06 because the great tribulation is near.
00:43:11 When Jehovah’s day comes,
00:43:13 our brotherhood will be safe because it’s united.
00:43:17 Our worldwide unity is but one of the blessings
00:43:20 that result from our Christian neutrality.
00:43:24 In this month’s music video, notice the connection
00:43:27 between the love we enjoy as God’s people
00:43:30 and our being “no part of this world.”
00:43:34 The song is entitled “We Are One.”
00:43:48 There’s trouble in the world, disunity. No matter where we live, no harmony.
00:44:04 There are people suffering, fighting for change.
00:44:09 But among God’s people, we trust in his name.
00:44:16 So we must stick close to his Word And remain no part of this world
00:44:25 With love in ev’ry little thing we do.
00:44:31 Show love as we spread the good news, And feel the love of the brotherhood.
00:44:41 Though we stand out as diff’rent, With Jehovah, we are one.
00:44:57 No matter where we go from sea to sea, With God’s people, we find true family.
00:45:08 Yes, there are anxieties, but hope is real— A paradise to come.
00:45:15 True peace is near.
00:45:19 So we keep trusting in his Word And remain no part of this world
00:45:28 With love in ev’ry little thing we do. Show love as we spread the good news,
00:45:39 And feel the love of the brotherhood.
00:45:45 Though we stand out as diff’rent, With Jehovah, we are one.
00:45:50 We are one.
00:46:00 So let’s stay faithful and endure And remain no part of this world
00:46:10 With love in ev’ry little thing we do. Show love as we spread the good news,
00:46:21 And feel the love of the brotherhood. Though we stand out as diff’rent,
00:46:30 With Jehovah, We love in ev’ry little thing we do.
00:46:38 Show love as we spread the good news, And feel the love of the brotherhood.
00:46:48 Though we stand out as diff’rent, With Jehovah, we are one.
00:47:18 The song was initially written in the Lingala language,
00:47:21 an African language spoken mainly
00:47:23 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo.
00:47:27 If you’d like to hear the song in the Lingala language,
00:47:30 you can now find it on Video on Demand under the heading “Music.”
00:47:34 While you’re at it, why not listen
00:47:37 to other original songs in different languages?
00:47:40 After you have navigated to the “Music” section,
00:47:43 change the language of the website
00:47:45 in the top right corner to a language of your choice.
00:47:51 Have you noticed the many examples of Christian neutrality
00:47:54 we’ve seen during this program?
00:47:57 First, we visited Armenia and learned
00:47:59 how they’ve remained neutral despite persecution.
00:48:03 After the talk, we learned the importance
00:48:06 of remaining neutral at public events.
00:48:09 Next, we met a number of brothers and sisters
00:48:12 who shared their experiences in applying
00:48:14 the Watchtower study article about neutrality.
00:48:18 Brother Morris reminded us of Jehovah’s protection
00:48:21 when Jehovah judges this world.
00:48:23 And our music video encouraged us
00:48:26 to enjoy the blessings of unity
00:48:28 that result from our Christian neutrality.
00:48:33 And speaking of the music video:
00:48:35 Did you notice how our friends watched the broadcast,
00:48:38 and when the postcard came up at the end of the program, they waved back?
00:48:44 Have you ever felt like doing that?
00:48:46 If so, here’s another opportunity.
00:48:49 Let’s visit our brothers  and sisters in South Korea.
00:48:54 Kingdom proclaimers arrived in Korea in 1912.
00:48:58 Today, the Republic of Korea
00:49:00 has some 1,300 congregations
00:49:03 with over 100,000 publishers.
00:49:07 Although the peninsula was under colonial rule for some time
00:49:10 and has been involved in other military conflicts,
00:49:13 Jehovah’s Witnesses there  have maintained their Christian neutrality
00:49:17 by not taking sides.
00:49:20 Over the last seven decades,
00:49:22 more than 19,000 brothers have been imprisoned for their faith.
00:49:27 In 2018, a favorable court decision
00:49:30 was handed down in behalf of these faithful brothers.
00:49:34 In the future, we look forward
00:49:36 to even further relief from fair-minded officials in this country.
00:49:41 This is the Ganseong Congregation.
00:49:45 Their territory has a population of approximately 23,000
00:49:48 and is partially located
00:49:51 in the demilitarized zone near the North Korean border.
00:49:55 It’s not uncommon for the almost 50 publishers
00:49:58 to conduct over 60 Bible studies each month.
00:50:01 In fact,
00:50:02 some 30 publishers —or 60 percent of the congregation—
00:50:07 serve as regular pioneers.
00:50:10 Because of its location, many of the residents
00:50:13 of the villages in this area are isolated from the rest of the country.
00:50:17 Our brothers and sisters
00:50:19 often meet people who work for the military.
00:50:22 Because of the congregation’s proximity to the border,
00:50:25 busloads of tourists come on a regular basis
00:50:29 to see the North Korean border.
00:50:32 To reach such visitors with the good news, our brothers have organized
00:50:35 public witnessing stands in a number of locations.
00:50:39 We love our brothers and sisters in the Ganseong Congregation very much.
00:50:44 And they send their love to all of us around the world.
00:50:48 This is JW Broadcasting
00:50:52 from the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

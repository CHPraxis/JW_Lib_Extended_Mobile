00:00:20 I suppose whatever we give to Jehovah
00:00:22 is little in comparison with what he gives to us.
00:00:25 And like Malachi 3:10 says, you know,
00:00:28 we just have to ‘bring in the tenth part.’
00:00:29 That’s really all that Jehovah is asking,
00:00:31 but he pours out a blessing.
00:00:33 And part of those blessings from Malachi 3:10,
00:00:37 I consider to be the friendships that we’ve gained.
00:00:40 For me, my favorite thing is the people.
00:00:42 It’s always just getting to work
00:00:45 with your brothers every day.
00:00:47 The personalities shine through, even with language differences.
00:00:51 You just make friends, and you just get this taste
00:00:54 of what the new world is going to be like.
00:00:56 Side by side with our brothers,
00:00:59 we’ve made parent figures and brother and sister figures,
00:01:02 and everybody just becomes part of such a solid family.
00:01:07 Working along with the local brothers and sisters
00:01:11 made it clear to me
00:01:12 that we really are in the organization
00:01:15 that Jehovah is directing today.
00:01:20 What I have seen is how Jehovah’s spirit
00:01:23 operates in his organization.
00:01:26 There were many international servants here
00:01:29 from various countries,
00:01:31 with different personalities,
00:01:33 along with our local brothers with their distinct customs.
00:01:37 But when it was time to work, we were as one.
00:01:42 There wasn’t a big guy, a little guy,
00:01:45 someone more intelligent, or less intelligent.
00:01:48 We all formed one united team.
00:01:52 The language definitely was an issue for me.
00:01:56 At first I thought,
00:01:58 ‘Will I really be able to work with the brothers?’
00:02:01 Since I didn’t understand the language,
00:02:04 how could I explain the work that had to be done?
00:02:10 Really, if you go in there with a good attitude
00:02:13 and you’re just having a good time working with your brothers,
00:02:15 you’re not going to have too much of a problem.
00:02:17 Smiles —they cross borders.
00:02:27 The Chiclayo dedication program
00:02:29 was held April 9, 2016,
00:02:32 and the Trujillo Assembly Hall
00:02:34 was dedicated shortly thereafter,
00:02:36 on July 31.
00:02:43 All present marveled with appreciation
00:02:46 at seeing the facilities,
00:02:49 their own new Assembly Hall.
00:02:55 Before, we had to work a lot,
00:02:57 maybe up to 15 days beforehand
00:02:59 to prepare a completely inappropriate site.
00:03:02 Not anymore.
00:03:04 Now the brothers only need to maintain it
00:03:06 and simply arrive in order to enjoy their assembly.
00:03:10 I’m sure that this new Assembly Hall
00:03:12 will strengthen the spirituality
00:03:14 of our dear brothers and sisters.
00:03:18 If I can say something about the video monitors:
00:03:21 They’ve revolutionized Jehovah’s method of teaching.
00:03:26 We get so much more out of the talks now
00:03:28 because we can see
00:03:29 the gestures of the brothers.
00:03:31 It really touches the heart.
00:03:33 It’s so amazing!
00:03:36 I remember more than 25 years ago,
00:03:39 I prayed to Jehovah and said,
00:03:41 “Jehovah, please, permit me at some point to see
00:03:45 an Assembly Hall here.”
00:03:47 And now Jehovah let me
00:03:49 be part of the buying process,
00:03:51 of getting the documentation,
00:03:53 and of being part of the construction.
00:03:55 And I remember, and I say,
00:03:58 “Jehovah answered my prayer.”
00:04:02 Well, it affected me
00:04:06 seeing the construction progress
00:04:09 because when we first arrived
00:04:11 at our project in Chiclayo,
00:04:13 you know what the brothers had
00:04:15 and what they were using as an Assembly Hall.
00:04:18 And then to see the finished project
00:04:20 that we see now,
00:04:22 I’m so happy for the brothers and sisters.
00:04:25 It’s so beautiful, clean, neat, and tidy.
00:04:28 It’s like, in reality, for where it is,
00:04:31 it’s a little jewel within that whole city
00:04:33 to me when I see the completed project.
00:04:37 And I know that brothers do just love to be able to care for that place,
00:04:42 to be able to worship Jehovah there, and to be with their brothers and sisters.
00:04:46 There’s nothing that will ever compare
00:04:49 with this wonderful experience we’ve been able to have.
00:04:53 It’s been great!

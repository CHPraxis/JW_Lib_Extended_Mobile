Hello.

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is River.

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Eden.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to see Uncle Tony and Auntie Anna.

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:19.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re helping to build the new Bethel
in Britain at the Chelmsford construction site.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have been given
special permission to show us around.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can see how a Bethel is built!

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, River and Eden.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready to get going?

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye!

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, let’s go!

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are all these buildings for?

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:56.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these two buildings up there on the hill
—they’re the production buildings.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one right in front of us—that’s the office building.

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then these ones down the hill
—they’re all the residences for the Bethelites.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes years of work
before you can even start building a Bethel.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do you want to know what the first step is?

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, come with me.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello!

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the office where the designers work.

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:22.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, my name is Dan.
What are your names?

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is River.

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my name is Eden.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, it’s really nice to meet you both.

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is the design office.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers tell us what they want;
we work out how to build it.

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:32.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why do you build these models?

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark, Stacey?

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a second?

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:38.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe they can explain
what’s happening in this model.

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you make a model like this,

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you really get an idea
of what the landscape will look like,

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how things will look in the setting, and how—

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s clever.

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:48.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really clever, isn’t it?

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, to build buildings this big,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need big machines.

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kids, this is Cori.

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cori—River and Eden.

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
River and Eden, nice to meet you.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:17.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much can the truck carry?

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:21.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can carry 25 tons.

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!
That’s like three elephants.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:26.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it hard to drive?

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it can be

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I’m in a very tight spot.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you recommend driving the massive truck?

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:36.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most definitely!

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is the most important department
on the whole project.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:46.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to come and see the kitchen?

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:47.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, let’s go.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, that’s really big!

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s quite heavy to stir.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ahh!
Ah! It’s so cold!

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s chocolate-flavored ice cream!

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:01.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ahh!
Nice!

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . three dishwashers.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:03.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So before we go, guys,
I’ve got one more person I’d like you to meet.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
River and Eden, this is Brother Luccioni.

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are you, Eden?

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nice to meet you.
I hear you had a tour today.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it was really good.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that’s great.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:40.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I understand you have some questions for me.

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s go someplace
where we can talk about them, OK?

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go this way.

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:50.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you had some questions.
What’s your first one?

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it like working with your friends?

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:54.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that is the best thing.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every day you look forward

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:59.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to coming in because you’re going
to get to be with your friends.

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah help you with your job?

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Jehovah helps us so much with our job.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, for me personally,
he helps me keep calm,

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I think about all the work
that we have in supporting the Governing Body.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have so much work to do.

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing how Jehovah

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:18.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes a group of volunteers

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(brothers and sisters
who are doing this just because they want to)

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:23.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who come and work together

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing how they
accomplish this is the most incredible thing.

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my favorite part of every project.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:30.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many prayers do you think you’ve said?

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:35.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t even count how many—many prayers.

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s only
with Jehovah’s help that we get it done.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not because of us.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:42.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you had some really good questions.

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:43.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:45.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you are welcome.

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much for coming to visit.

00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope you enjoyed learning
how a Bethel is built.

00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now it’s time to go home.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:04:59.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

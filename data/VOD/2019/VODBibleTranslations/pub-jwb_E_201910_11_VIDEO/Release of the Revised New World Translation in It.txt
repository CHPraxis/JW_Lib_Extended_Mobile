00:00:04 A special event took place on December 16, 2017,
00:00:09 that was a milestone in the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy.
00:00:14 Around 8,000 Witnesses
00:00:16 attended at a sports arena in Rome.
00:00:18 Brothers were also tied in from all the Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls
00:00:23 throughout Italy and Italian-speaking Switzerland.
00:00:27 The first part of the program
00:00:30 allowed the audience to relive the history
00:00:32 of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Italy.
00:00:39 In the 1950’s and 1960’s,
00:00:42 it was difficult to obtain a copy of the Bible.
00:00:45 People could only purchase them
00:00:46 from the few religious bookstores existing then.
00:00:52 During those years,
00:00:54 many who were interested in God’s Word flooded into the congregations.
00:00:58 In order to provide them with Bibles,
00:01:01 large quantities of various editions
00:01:04 were bought and then distributed at cost.
00:01:07 However, those editions were not always available.
00:01:10 So when, in January 1967, it was announced
00:01:14 that the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures
00:01:17 in Italian would be printed,
00:01:19 there was great excitement among the brothers,
00:01:21 who could finally all use the same translation of God’s Word.
00:01:25 There have been constant improvements made
00:01:29 to the New World Translation through the years,
00:01:31 and it has been made available in various formats and editions.
00:01:39 On December 16, 2017,
00:01:42 Brother Samuel Herd, a member of the Governing Body,
00:01:46 presented the new revised edition of the New World Translation in Italian.
00:01:51 By now you may be thinking,
00:01:52 ‘What about the New World Translation
00:01:55 in our language?’
00:02:00 ‘Will it ever be revised like the New World Translation in English?’
00:02:08 What do you think is in this package?
00:02:51 I was so moved
00:02:53 that it brought me to tears.
00:02:56 I was near some elderly ones
00:02:58 when the Bible was released.
00:03:00 Just thinking about their
00:03:01 endurance through the years
00:03:03 and now to be holding a new revised edition of the Bible
00:03:06 —it really touched me to see their joy when they received it.
00:03:09 It was really moving and very touching
00:03:12 to see the brothers open their Bibles
00:03:14 and leaf through them.
00:03:16 They had been waiting for years.
00:03:19 I felt like a little child.
00:03:22 I was so excited
00:03:24 —like when you know your dad is going to give you a present.
00:03:27 You know it’s coming, but you don’t know when.
00:03:29 And when it arrives, you just jump for joy.
00:03:32 My name is Mattia, and this Bible is my present from Jehovah.
00:03:40 I can’t wait to read the Bible all over again from the beginning.
00:03:57 It will definitely make daily Bible reading more enjoyable.
00:04:06 I really felt Jehovah’s tender care for me.
00:04:09 I was so happy.
00:04:11 All 284,258
00:04:15 attending the event in Rome
00:04:18 or tied in from other locations received a copy
00:04:21 of the much-awaited gift —an expression of the deep love of Jehovah,
00:04:26 the Author of the Holy Bible.

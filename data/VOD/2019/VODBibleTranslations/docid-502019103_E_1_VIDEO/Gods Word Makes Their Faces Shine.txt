00:00:02 January 21, 2017, became a special day
00:00:06 for deaf people in Japan.
00:00:10 Jehovah’s Witnesses released the book of Matthew
00:00:13 in Japanese Sign Language.
00:00:17 What, though, was behind these smiles?
00:00:23 When I used to read the Japanese Bible,
00:00:25 I really didn’t understand it,
00:00:27 so I forced myself to read—not much of a joy.
00:00:31 Right, it was hard to understand and explain to people.
00:00:36 The Bible, written in a language we do not know, will not move our heart.
00:00:42 Having no sign-language Bible
00:00:44 was a huge disadvantage when it came to cultivating a longing for God.
00:00:49 When making shepherding calls, reasoning on a scripture
00:00:53 with a deaf person was difficult if that scripture
00:00:57 wasn’t translated into sign language.
00:00:59 There is a Bible in American Sign Language,
00:01:04 so I was envious and wanted to see the Bible
00:01:08 in Japanese Sign Language so much.
00:01:11 At last, approval was given for Bible translation
00:01:15 into Japanese Sign Language.
00:01:18 I noticed that the translation team
00:01:21 offered a prayer before they started each day’s work.
00:01:23 Also, when faced with difficult translation problems,
00:01:27 they relied on Jehovah’s holy spirit through prayers
00:01:31 so that they could exercise good judgment.
00:01:33 It was impressive.
00:01:35 There are various processes needed for God’s Word
00:01:38 to jump off the page and reach the heart of deaf people.
00:01:42 They considered carefully  how to express scriptures
00:01:46 so that deaf people would understand.
00:01:48 Let’s take an example: “the lilies of the field” at Matthew 6:28.
00:01:54 I wasn’t able to understand Matthew chapter 6 until now.
00:01:59 I always thought, ‘“Birds of heaven” and “lilies of the field,”
00:02:03 What do they have to do with “seeking first the Kingdom”?’
00:02:06 The translators individually read and research
00:02:09 the source text to fully understand what they’ll translate.
00:02:14 Then the team meets to discuss the text
00:02:17 and explore ideas for translating certain concepts.
00:02:20 After the translation is complete,
00:02:23 the assigned brother signs the translation to prepare the prompt video.
00:02:28 Then studio recording takes place,
00:02:31 referencing the prompt video.
00:02:33 The recorded movie is carefully edited
00:02:37 and prepared for delivery.
00:02:41 In this case,
00:02:43 the signer pretends to be a flower
00:02:45 and weaves his own petals
00:02:49 and sews them on his face.
00:02:53 Then he asks,
00:02:55 “Flowers don’t do that, do they?”
00:02:58 God’s Word coming off the pages
00:03:00 has reached the heart of deaf people.
00:03:06 I understood for the first time that Jehovah is kindly teaching us,
00:03:11 ‘If you seek the Kingdom first, I’ll give you everything you need.
00:03:15 Don’t worry.’
00:03:20 I was watching it on the train on my way to work.
00:03:23 I thought, ‘Wow, this is so good!’
00:03:29 I was absorbed in the video, and I missed my train station.
00:03:33 So I changed trains, but again,
00:03:37 I was watching the video and missed my station again!
00:03:41 The book of Matthew is that interesting.
00:03:47 Humans have beneficial feelings
00:03:50 because we are created in God’s image.
00:03:55 But because of Satan’s system of things, these feelings are driven away.
00:04:01 However, when you show God’s Word to people or read it yourself,
00:04:05 innate beneficial feelings well up in our hearts.
00:04:11 I strongly feel that God’s Word has the power to do that.
00:04:15 Just like a child grows up listening to what their father says,
00:04:19 I can be closer to my Father, Jehovah, by watching him
00:04:23 speak to me in my native tongue, sign language.
00:04:26 Comments from deaf brothers show
00:04:29 that the sign-language Bible talks to their heart directly.
00:04:33 I imagine that Jehovah loves our brothers,
00:04:36 and his face is shining.
00:04:39 And the faces of our brothers are also shining.
00:04:46 Now by means of having God’s living Word
00:04:49 in the language of their heart,
00:04:51 our deaf brothers and sisters
00:04:53 are seeing Jehovah’s face shining.

And thank you for tuning in for this update.

I wish we could help.

00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! I have an idea.

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:52.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it, Sweetie?

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:04.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I give this to our brothers

Of course you can.

We’ll put it in the contribution box on Sunday.

My piggy bank was empty.

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:14.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I can’t help.

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:18.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things you can do to help.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, you can save some money for next time.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, you can think
about them and pray for them.

You know, Jesus felt the same way
when he was here on earth.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what he said
when he helped the leper?

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to!”

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did what he could to help others,

00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:43.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like you.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:47.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

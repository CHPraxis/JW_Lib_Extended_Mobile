Nice comments today—both of you!

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Mom, will we . . .

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . go to the park?

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, I think so.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, OK!

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just have to wait a bit for Dad
and then see what he says.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here comes Dad!

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it looks like somebody needs a ride.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope this doesn’t spoil your plans.

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful afternoon!

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, we’re going to take Wilfred home
and help him with a few things. OK?

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll get the tools.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, you know,

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
today you can make something
Jesus made all the time.

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make something?
What?

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sacrifice.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus worked hard.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes he had plans to rest.

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when people needed his help,

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made a sacrifice, . . .

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus!
Help us!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . giving up what he wanted to do . . .

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . to help someone else.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:52.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right!

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did that make him feel?

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy—even if he
didn’t get to go to the park.

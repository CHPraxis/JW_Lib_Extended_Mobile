Whoa! Awesome!

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so shiny!

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You two are really excited about it.

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:20.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a lot of fun things you can do

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:34.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and important things too!

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, before we let you use it,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to establish a few rules.

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aw! Rules?

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, kids,
because too much of a good thing

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can become a bad thing.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you mean?

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wise man once said:

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is an appointed time for everything.”

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you are always looking down at your device,

00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:07.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can lose track of time

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:15.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or miss beautiful things happening around you.

00:01:21.604 --> 00:01:23.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mother and I

00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:25.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to set time limits for you,

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:29.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll always be under our supervision.

00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:34.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five more minutes, Caleb.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:36.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Mom.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, time is a gift from Jehovah.

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:41.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should use it wisely.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that right, Honey?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right!

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, smile.

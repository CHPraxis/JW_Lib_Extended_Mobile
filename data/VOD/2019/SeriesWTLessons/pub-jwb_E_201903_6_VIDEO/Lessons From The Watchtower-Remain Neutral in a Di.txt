00:00:14 As a professor of finance, I need to be well-informed.
00:00:16 As a Christian, I also need to be well-informed,
00:00:19 as do all Christians.
00:00:21 It’s difficult not to take sides in politics.
00:00:24 It’s very difficult because we are aware of the issues.
00:00:29 I always really liked soccer ever since I was little.
00:00:32 I lived in a poor area, and soccer was what we used to do for fun.
00:00:37 There was a journalist that I liked to keep up with.
00:00:40 He would point out both the good and the bad on all sides of politics.
00:00:44 But when he spoke up and pointed out only the bad side of a political party,
00:00:49 I did not like that.
00:00:52 I live in the downtown area of the city.
00:00:55 That is where the largest political demonstrations take place.
00:00:59 People from this area are really into politics.
00:01:01 They have definite opinions.
00:01:03 And even though I always knew that we must remain neutral,
00:01:07 I secretly approved of the demonstrations.
00:01:12 On the outside, I wasn’t jumping up and down or cheering,
00:01:15 but on the inside, I was saying: ‘Come on! Let’s win!’
00:01:20 It was all about the desire, the crowd,
00:01:23 and the pride of your team having the most victories or the most trophies.
00:01:27 I used to rationalize saying:
00:01:29 “I was created in Jehovah’s image, and Jehovah is a just God.”
00:01:33 What was speaking was my sense of justice.
00:01:35 I thought neutrality was shown through actions
00:01:38 and not through what I felt.
00:01:40 The April 2016 Watchtower
00:01:43 has interesting information regarding neutrality.
00:01:46 Being neutral means that you do not consider yourself better than others
00:01:51 because “in God’s sight, all people are equal.”
00:01:54 After studying the article, I realized that I needed to make changes;
00:01:58 I was not being neutral.
00:02:00 So I read the article again.
00:02:02 I prayed to Jehovah;
00:02:03 I said to him that I knew it was as if he were speaking to me.
00:02:07 The magazine really touched me deeply.
00:02:11 I remember reading the article at least three times that evening.
00:02:15 I was really surprised.
00:02:17 I realized how far off I was
00:02:20 from what God wanted me to be on the inside.
00:02:23 The second situation mentioned in the article
00:02:25 had to do with news reports and the media.
00:02:28 The article even suggested that we limit
00:02:30 our intake of news that we watch related to politics.
00:02:34 There was another phrase that really moved me.
00:02:36 It said: ‘Even if we don’t march with protesters,
00:02:39 might we be with them in spirit?’
00:02:41 Yes! I was with them. Yes!
00:02:44 There were several phrases in that article
00:02:46 that were written just for me.
00:02:50 When I cut back watching so many news reports
00:02:54 —and I had to—
00:02:55 this helped me to have self-control when I spoke to others at work.
00:03:00 When workmates mentioned something that was in the news,
00:03:03 I didn’t have anything to say since I hadn’t seen it.
00:03:06 I didn’t know about it.
00:03:08 A workmate would say: “Did you see that so-and-so said this
00:03:11 and that someone else made a statement?”
00:03:13 I would say: “No, I didn’t see it,”
00:03:16 and that was the end of the conversation.
00:03:18 The article mentions Romans 10:12
00:03:20 which says that Jehovah is “Lord over all” of us,
00:03:23 that ‘there is no difference between Jew and Greek.’
00:03:26 To Jehovah, it’s not important if my country
00:03:29 has five or six titles or if it won or lost the World Cup.
00:03:33 To Jehovah, all people are equal.
00:03:36 I took a piece of paper, just a simple piece of paper,
00:03:40 and I wrote on it the four key points that the article talks about
00:03:44 —four key points that will help us to remain neutral.
00:03:49 I keep it in my purse; that way I can always read it at work.
00:03:55 I like watching soccer; it’s fun.
00:03:58 I still watch it on TV.
00:04:00 I still play soccer with my friends at Bethel,
00:04:03 but I’ve made an effort to change.
00:04:06 Little by little, I’ve managed to put soccer in its proper place.
00:04:12 This helps me to keep pride and nationalism from getting the best of me.
00:04:17 I learned from this article not to express opinions about politics.
00:04:21 That has to come from deep inside.
00:04:24 If I’m convinced that God’s Kingdom is the best solution
00:04:27 and that there’s nothing that comes even close,
00:04:30 remaining neutral will come naturally.
00:04:32 But I can’t let my guard down.
00:04:35 I really enjoy studying articles from The Watchtower,
00:04:38 especially those dealing with practical matters.
00:04:40 They help me see the Bible as if it were a mirror that shows me where I can improve.
00:04:44 Following counsel
00:04:47 and making the changes suggested in the article
00:04:50 has helped me to speak with the conviction
00:04:52 that only the Kingdom can solve mankind’s problems.

00:00:13 The challenge of serving in a foreign country can sometimes be that
00:00:16 because you’ve made that move and you’ve learned a foreign language,
00:00:19 you can feel like you’ve done enough.
00:00:21 I was brought up by a Witness mother,
00:00:24 so I studied the Bible since I was small.
00:00:27 So I thought I had Bible knowledge to some extent.
00:00:31 My wife and I have enjoyed
00:00:34 the traveling work for 18 years.
00:00:36 As we get older, trials that we never experienced
00:00:39 when we were young have come up one after another.
00:00:42 After I got married and had children,
00:00:45 I had a hard time explaining
00:00:48 the backgrounds of some Bible characters or Biblical history
00:00:53 when I studied the Bible with my children.
00:00:57 Then I realized
00:00:59 that I did not have enough Bible knowledge.
00:01:02 And another challenge can be
00:01:05 that you’re dealing with a foreign culture in the territory,
00:01:08 but you also have many different cultures in the congregation.
00:01:12 When I struggle to fulfill various responsibilities
00:01:15 in a balanced way
00:01:18 —things such as caring for aged parents and our own health issues—
00:01:22 it can be a source of stress
00:01:24 and cause tension between my wife and me.
00:01:27 The study article “Move Forward as a Spiritual Person!”
00:01:31 in February 2018 was a big help.
00:01:34 The expressions:
00:01:36 “Once we have identified areas for improvement, we need to take positive steps”
00:01:40 and that “it is a life-and-death matter”
00:01:44 really touched my heart.
00:01:46 I realized that I needed to scrutinize my life seriously
00:01:50 and make improvements for my own future and that of my family.
00:01:54 The article had a quote from Brother Barr that said:
00:01:57 “Many fail because they are not diligent enough to grow mighty.”
00:02:01 This made me think,
00:02:02 ‘Am I mighty enough to overcome any challenges
00:02:06 ‘that might come up, difficulties with brothers and sisters,
00:02:09 in a way that pleases Jehovah?’
00:02:11 To move ahead as a spiritual person,
00:02:13 I realized that I needed to get Jehovah’s thinking on matters
00:02:16 and really look at Bible principles.
00:02:19 And that means letting go of my pride;
00:02:21 and when it comes back, letting go of it again
00:02:24 and really making Jehovah’s thoughts my own thoughts.
00:02:27 I have a bad tendency to try to do everything
00:02:31 by myself and to not delegate things to others.
00:02:37 I asked myself, ‘What decision will please Jehovah?’
00:02:42 “Make sure of the more important things.”
00:02:46 I felt the need to train
00:02:48 younger brothers in the congregation
00:02:50 so that I could delegate responsibilities to them.
00:02:54 The article encouraged us to look to Bible principles.
00:02:57 And two that really helped me
00:02:59 were Proverbs 15:28 and Philippians 2:4
00:03:03 because it helped me to think
00:03:07 about what is in the person’s best interests
00:03:09 before I respond to them.
00:03:12 I took time when reading Bible accounts
00:03:15 to meditate on how I would feel
00:03:17 if I were one of those Bible characters.
00:03:24 I can now explain things better at my children’s study.
00:03:30 I’m very happy to see my children
00:03:34 truly enjoying Christian activities.
00:03:36 My son started doing “play meetings” for fun.
00:03:40 My daughter loves the ministry.
00:03:43 She talks to people willingly,
00:03:45 not because we as parents are telling her to do so.
00:03:48 Compared to how it was when I was a child,
00:03:51 things are totally different now,
00:03:53 and that really makes me happy.
00:03:57 By applying this principle,
00:03:59 I can lighten my load
00:04:02 and reduce my stress level.
00:04:05 In turn, that helps me to maintain joy,
00:04:09 to strengthen our relationship as a couple,
00:04:12 and I feel I’ve become
00:04:14 more approachable to those in the congregation.
00:04:19 Having the “mind of Christ” has helped me in my assignment
00:04:23 because it’s helped me to form really close friendships
00:04:25 with the brothers and sisters in my congregation, and that’s brought me
00:04:28 a lot of joy in my service.
00:04:30 And also, when I don’t know what to do (which often happens),
00:04:35 I have Jehovah’s principles to guide me,
00:04:39 and that makes me feel safe and secure.

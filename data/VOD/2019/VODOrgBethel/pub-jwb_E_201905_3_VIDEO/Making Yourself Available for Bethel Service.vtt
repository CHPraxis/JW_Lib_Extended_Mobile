00:00:01.685 --> 00:00:03.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
How heartwarming it’s been

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:07.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see millions take their stand
for true worship!

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:11.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thousands more are joining us every week.

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:14.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering work,

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this makes us very happy.

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who will work to provide the Bibles,

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:24.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible literature,
and the audio and video publications

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sustain us spiritually
and help us to accomplish

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:30.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Kingdom preaching and teaching work?

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:34.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethel is a unique place.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:39.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s where mature Christians
render sacred service to Jehovah

00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:42.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
in close association with Christ’s brothers.

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
They minister to the needs
of our worldwide brotherhood

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and support the preaching work.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bethel family is a group

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:55.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
of dedicated, baptized servants of Jehovah

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
who live and work together closely.

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:01.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they experience in a special way

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Psalm 133:1 says:

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:09.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! How good and how pleasant it is

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:15.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very pleased to see that many

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
have expanded their service to Jehovah

00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:20.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
by making themselves available

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:23.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the special privilege of Bethel service.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you considered this as a goal?

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:31.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making yourself available for Bethel service

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like knocking on a door that leads
to many other privileges of service.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, to serve at Bethel requires

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
a self-sacrificing spirit

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:44.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a willingness to serve
wherever there is a need,

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:47.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with the attitude displayed
by the prophet Isaiah

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 6:8:

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying:

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:02.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said: ‘Here I am! Send me!’”

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:07.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Isaiah learned about an opportunity
to do more in Jehovah’s service,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
he responded eagerly,
even though he did not know exactly

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he was going to be assigned to do.

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:17.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was enough for him to know
that Jehovah was extending an invitation

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve in a special way,

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:22.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same spirit is shown
by Bethel family members worldwide.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
What especially motivates so many
to serve at Bethel?

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for Jehovah moves us

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put Kingdom interests
ahead of self-interest.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated in the <i>Proclaimers </i> book, page 295:

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is not work in which they gain

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“personal prominence or material possessions.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their desire is to honor Jehovah,
and they are satisfied

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:55.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the provisions made for them
in the way of food, lodging,

00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a modest [allowance]
for personal expenses.”

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:03.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are there any rewards
that come from serving in this unique way?

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:07.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who have offered themselves willingly
for Bethel service

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
have truly been blessed.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.309 line:10% position:50% align:center
The love and unity we feel here

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.144 line:10% position:50% align:center
is incomparable.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not like in a company out in the world

00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
because here you can work
with your friends every day.

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:25.722 line:10% position:50% align:center
Like-minded people have the same goals

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:26.956 line:10% position:50% align:center
and support each other.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is what you can feel here.

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:31.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’re assigned a task

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:33.496 line:10% position:50% align:center
that you’ve never performed before,

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:36.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there are many experienced
brothers and sisters who can help

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
—professionally as well as personally.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:42.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
Whether it is the consideration

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:44.374 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the daily text or the <i>Watchtower </i> Study

00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:45.775 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the Bethel family,

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:49.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
listening to the practical, valuable comments
of our brothers and sisters

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:51.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really refreshing.

00:03:51.347 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
You really feel that they love Jehovah,

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their comments help you to feel the same.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.088 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here in Bethel, you have

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:01.724 line:10% position:50% align:center
the best Employer that there is—Jehovah.

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:05.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
No other employer is as grateful
and considerate as he is,

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
so out of love for Jehovah,
you’re simply happy to give him your best.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.334 line:10% position:50% align:center
Whenever I think

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.503 line:10% position:50% align:center
about what is being done at Bethel

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.338 line:10% position:50% align:center
—publications are being produced

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.139 line:10% position:50% align:center
and shipped,

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos for our conventions are being made,

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:23.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and translation is being done
into so many different languages—

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:24.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
I keep getting goose bumps.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.617 line:10% position:50% align:center
No matter what I can do here,

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:29.285 line:10% position:50% align:center
knowing that by doing it

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:31.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
I am supporting Christ’s brothers

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes me feel very, very good.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does a young person
qualify for Bethel service?

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:43.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents raised me
to have a spiritual focus.

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:47.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
So during the school holidays and growing up,

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
our life revolved around the ministry

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:52.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
—doing spiritual activities.

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:53.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it really helped us

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.312 line:10% position:50% align:center
keep focused spiritually as a family

00:04:56.312 --> 00:04:58.581 line:10% position:50% align:center
and helped me stay focused

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:01.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the goals that I wanted to achieve.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:04.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really enjoy reading,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one day my Dad just said to me,
“Why don’t you read the Bible?”

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know it sounds obvious,
but at that point, I had never read it

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Genesis to Revelation.

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:15.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I finished reading the Bible,

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:18.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really changed my thinking,

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:22.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it really proved the truth to me.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this helped me to keep a spiritual focus,

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it really was the first step

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
in reaching out and achieving
the spiritual goals that I wanted to achieve.

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the congregation, I was able to help out

00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:41.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
with doing the magazines
and the sound and the platform.

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:44.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these privileges really helped me

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:46.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a good work ethic

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:51.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to give in many ways,
so that I could give more to Jehovah.

00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the elders used
to work with me a lot in the ministry.

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:58.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I felt that ‘I can’t do this’

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ‘This is too much’
or ‘It’s too overwhelming’

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:02.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ‘I’ll never be able to reach this goal,’

00:06:02.745 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
an elder showed me a scripture in the Bible

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah was encouraging Joshua
to be courageous.

00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:13.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really impacted me,

00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:16.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I was able to be courageous, too,

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to reach my goal of Bethel.

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:24.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I visited Bethel,
I saw that they were normal people,

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:28.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had so many good qualities

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I wanted to imitate

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
—very hospitable, very warm, very inviting.

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped me to want to reach my goal,
so that I could be like them.

00:06:41.017 --> 00:06:44.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
To serve at Bethel,
there are qualifications that need to be met.

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.257 line:10% position:50% align:center
You should have a deep love for Jehovah

00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:49.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the organization,

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:51.494 line:10% position:50% align:center
which is demonstrated by living

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.896 line:10% position:50% align:center
in harmony with Bible standards.

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:56.165 line:10% position:50% align:center
You must have a fine reputation

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:57.900 line:10% position:50% align:center
as a spiritual person.

00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:00.069 line:10% position:50% align:center
You should have respect

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.205 line:10% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s moral standards,

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:05.608 line:10% position:50% align:center
avoiding uncleanness and sexual immorality.

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:07.376 line:10% position:50% align:center
You should have a clean conscience

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:08.711 line:10% position:50% align:center
before Jehovah

00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:10.346 line:10% position:50% align:center
and be at peace with yourself

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:12.415 line:10% position:50% align:center
and with Jehovah’s organization.

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:14.984 line:10% position:50% align:center
Your dress and grooming

00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:16.452 line:10% position:50% align:center
should be exemplary,

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:18.354 line:10% position:50% align:center
befitting a Christian minister

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.590 line:10% position:50% align:center
even during leisure time.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.826 line:10% position:50% align:center
Styles that are faddish or extreme

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:25.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
or that identify us

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.830 line:10% position:50% align:center
with undesirable elements of the world

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.799 line:10% position:50% align:center
are not acceptable at Bethel.

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:34.337 line:10% position:50% align:center
The applicant would not read, listen to,

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:36.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
or view any type of material

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:39.008 line:10% position:50% align:center
that is inappropriate for a Christian.

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:40.743 line:10% position:50% align:center
Such unwholesome material

00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:43.112 line:10% position:50% align:center
certainly would include pornography,

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:44.680 line:10% position:50% align:center
debasing music,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.682 line:10% position:50% align:center
or any kind of entertainment

00:07:46.682 --> 00:07:49.018 line:10% position:50% align:center
that features sexual immorality,

00:07:49.018 --> 00:07:51.420 line:10% position:50% align:center
spiritism, or violence.

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:54.123 line:10% position:50% align:center
Bethel applicants should be

00:07:54.123 --> 00:07:57.493 line:10% position:50% align:center
from 19 to 35 years of age.

00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
Occasionally, there is an opening

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:02.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
for someone over 35 years of age

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:04.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
who may have specialized skills

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.635 line:10% position:50% align:center
that are needed at Bethel,

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:07.670 line:10% position:50% align:center
such as those with certain technical

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.472 line:10% position:50% align:center
or medical experience,

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:11.340 line:10% position:50% align:center
translation skills,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.043 line:10% position:50% align:center
or building trades such as plumbing,

00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:17.213 line:10% position:50% align:center
electrical, heavy equipment mechanics,

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:18.881 line:10% position:50% align:center
or carpentry.

00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:21.417 line:10% position:50% align:center
Those with such capabilities and training

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.952 line:10% position:50% align:center
are welcome to apply.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
In view of the unique demands

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:28.457 line:10% position:50% align:center
of a full-time assignment at Bethel,

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:30.026 line:10% position:50% align:center
you should be mentally

00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:31.961 line:10% position:50% align:center
and emotionally sound,

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:33.429 line:10% position:50% align:center
physically strong,

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.431 line:10% position:50% align:center
and able to work long hours.

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
You should be able to read, write, and speak

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:42.305 line:10% position:50% align:center
the primary language of the branch territory.

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:44.540 line:10% position:50% align:center
This will enable you to communicate well

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.442 line:10% position:50% align:center
with others serving at Bethel,

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.177 line:10% position:50% align:center
to receive needed training,

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:51.447 line:10% position:50% align:center
and to work safely in the Bethel environment.

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:54.383 line:10% position:50% align:center
Bethel applicants agree to serve

00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:56.152 line:10% position:50% align:center
for a minimum of one year,

00:08:56.152 --> 00:08:58.788 line:10% position:50% align:center
during which time you will receive training

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.957 line:10% position:50% align:center
for continued Bethel service.

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:05.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
With regard to secular skills,
we do not encourage individuals

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain university education or training

00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:14.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the thought that this will improve
their chances of being called into Bethel.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best way to prepare for Bethel service

00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:21.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to first serve
in the full-time pioneer ministry.

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:24.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest need is for single brothers.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, all who meet the qualifications,
including sisters,

00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
are encouraged to apply
for temporary volunteer service.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serving as a temporary volunteer at Bethel

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:39.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
may open the way to other opportunities
to expand your service to Jehovah.

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:43.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are interested
in applying for Bethel service,

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:47.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should make your desire known
to your Congregation Service Committee,

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will provide you access
to the online applications

00:09:50.806 --> 00:09:54.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of my.jw.org.

00:09:54.577 --> 00:09:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:57.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
which application should you complete,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
since there are two types
of applications available?

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:04.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
First give careful and prayerful consideration

00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:06.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
to your circumstances.

00:10:06.289 --> 00:10:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thereafter, decide whether you will complete

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:12.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Application for Volunteer Program</i>
(A-19),

00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:14.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is available for those interested

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
in serving on a temporary basis

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
for as brief as one week or as long

00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:20.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
as several consecutive months.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you may decide to complete

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>the Application to Become a Member</i>
<i>of the Worldwide Order</i>

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>of Special Full-Time Servants</i>
<i>of Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:31.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
(A-8).

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
This application is for those interested

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:35.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
in serving on a long-term basis

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
for one full year or longer.

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:40.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the Branch Committee determines

00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is a need for your services,

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will decide where you can best be used,

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:51.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether at Bethel or perhaps
on a theocratic construction assignment.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Submitting your application may open
a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah

00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his organization in a variety of ways.

00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:04.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, not all of us who have

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:07.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
such a self-sacrificing spirit

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
have the circumstances in life
to serve at Bethel.

00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can encourage others who do.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:19.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, follow the example
of God-fearing parents

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Hannah and Elkanah,

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
who willingly made their son available

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:28.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
for expanded theocratic privileges.

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:33.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to place the goal of Bethel service
before your young ones,

00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:36.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stimulate their interest
in the full-time ministry

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:41.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
by your example
and your positive expressions.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
If possible,

00:11:43.085 --> 00:11:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
bring them on a tour of world headquarters
in New York, U.S.A.,

00:11:47.323 --> 00:11:51.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
or make arrangements
to bring them on a tour of the Bethel

00:11:51.327 --> 00:11:55.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the branch territory in which you live.

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:59.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such visits can help young ones
to witness firsthand

00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:03.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work that’s being done at Bethel
to promote Kingdom interests.

00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:07.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, help young ones in your congregation

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have the potential
to expand their service to Jehovah

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the qualifications.

00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:16.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continues to look for those

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
willing to respond to his invitation

00:12:19.221 --> 00:12:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expand their service to him.

00:12:22.358 --> 00:12:24.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
As in Isaiah’s day, He asks:

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:31.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you answer as did the prophet:

00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:35.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Here I am! Send me!”

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage you to progress
to spiritual maturity

00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:41.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve Jehovah whole-souled.

00:12:41.243 --> 00:12:44.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
In due time, you may qualify
to serve at Bethel

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in another form
of exciting theocratic service

00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:52.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
that permits you to use the health
and strength that Jehovah has granted you

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:56.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an expanded way, all to his praise.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please be assured that we love you
for the willing spirit you show

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:07.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you continue to reach out
in Jehovah’s service.

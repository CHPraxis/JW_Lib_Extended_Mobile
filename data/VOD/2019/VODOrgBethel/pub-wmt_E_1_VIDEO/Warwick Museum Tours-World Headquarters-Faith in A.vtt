Welcome to the World Headquarters

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses at Warwick, New York.

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah’s people,

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are multicultural and multilingual.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the artwork here emphasizes, our focus

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on our commission to ‘preach the good news

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to people of all nations.’

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are we doing today as an organization?

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did we get here?

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s our main tool for this great work?

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to come tour our museums

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out.

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three museums here at Warwick,

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:11.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all funded by voluntary donations.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of them is alive with stories.

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:16.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upstairs on the second floor

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the museum Faith in Action.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we’ll see the very latest

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what’s being done by Jehovah’s organization.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also on the second floor is the museum

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A People for Jehovah’s Name.

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes us on an exciting journey back in time.

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And downstairs

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the Bible Museum.

00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:43.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we’ll get to see up close

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spiritual treasure chest.

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you tour the museums,
you’ll notice that they

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were designed to be, not passive, but interactive

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can put yourself in the experience.

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that preview,

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s take the tour.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the launching point
to the Faith in Action Museum.

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note that important, descriptive word: “action.”

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What activities, or actions,

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being organized and directed

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:22.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Governing Body today?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This display acquaints you right away

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the work of the Governing Body committees.

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each committee has specific responsibilities,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as you take the tour,

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the committees work together

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish their goals.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Faith in Action Museum

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is divided into four galleries:

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:45.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Show Love,”

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meet Together,”

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take In Spiritual Food,”

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Make Disciples.”

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you walk through the galleries,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how each of them
is connected by a JW-blue ribbon.

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you get lost,

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just follow the blue ribbon.

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the “Show Love” Gallery.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps God’s people
to ‘have love among themselves,’

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus commanded at John 13:35.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do the brothers at headquarters respond

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to needs that arise when a disaster strikes?

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When things like natural disasters,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
terrorist attacks, or civil unrest occur,

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Coordinators’ Committee directs relief efforts.

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:39.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They, in turn, communicate
with the Branch Committee

00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that oversees the affected area.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually, within 48 hours,

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:47.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a report of what’s occurred

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:49.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what’s being done to help our brothers

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is compiled and sent to headquarters.

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:55.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That report may be
the basis for informing the brotherhood

00:03:55.964 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through an article on jw.org®.

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:03.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another way that love
is shown to Jehovah’s people

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:06.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—schools.

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such schools as the School for Congregation Elders

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:13.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These have been very effective in training brothers

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:18.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shepherd the congregations lovingly.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Teaching Committee
is responsible for the curriculum,

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:28.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while the Service Committee
arranges for the selection of the students.

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:32.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the “Meet Together” Gallery.

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how
the Governing Body is helping God’s people

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet together “to incite

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:42.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love and fine works,” as directed

00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:45.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 10:24, 25.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is the headquarters staff
at Warwick filling that need?

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we keep growing,

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s an ongoing need

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:57.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build new Kingdom Halls
and to renovate existing ones.

00:04:58.402 --> 00:05:00.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Publishing Committee of the Governing Body

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:03.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directs where Kingdom Halls will be built

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:06.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes funds available to the branches.

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:09.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Publishing Committee

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:11.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
works closely with the branch office,

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:14.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its Local Design/Construction Department

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
carries out the work.

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:18.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where do these hardworking

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:20.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters come from?

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Personnel Committee

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appoints all construction servants

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:26.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for assignments in their home country

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in a foreign land.

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you worked on a theocratic building project?

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take our survey, and let us know.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some Kingdom Halls are located in areas

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there is little or no electricity,

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that doesn’t stop us from meeting together.

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:47.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Publishing Committee

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:50.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has arranged for a custom-built, portable sound system

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:53.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be used in these areas.

00:05:53.332 --> 00:05:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unity player has a battery

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be recharged by its solar panel

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with a built-in hand crank.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful provision

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps our brothers and sisters benefit more

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from their congregation meetings.

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the “Take In Spiritual Food” Gallery.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you guess what design we used?

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right, a dining table.

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:23.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfills the Scriptural commission

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:25.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 12:42

00:06:25.697 --> 00:06:28.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed God’s people spiritually.

00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:31.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish this,

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:33.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of Bibles, books,

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:35.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other publications

00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:39.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to be prepared, translated, and printed.

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:41.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,

00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:45.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a regular flow of material is released online.

00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:47.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translators around the world

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep in close contact with Translation Services

00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:52.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a headquarters department

00:06:52.683 --> 00:06:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s supervised by the Writing Committee.

00:06:55.644 --> 00:06:58.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a favorite publication?

00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:02.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much more is involved than just the writing.

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:05.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The section “From Start to Finish”

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:07.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outlines 11 steps

00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are taken to produce the final product.

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:14.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about our online spiritual food?

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each month, we look forward

00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a new JW Broadcasting® program.

00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:23.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the Teaching Committee approves a video idea,

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:27.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services researches the subject

00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:30.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepares a script for final approval.

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:33.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approved scripts and storyboards

00:07:33.515 --> 00:07:37.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are assigned
to video production teams around the world.

00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:41.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives our videos an international flavor.

00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:47.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve come
to our final gallery, “Make Disciples.”

00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how
the Governing Body is helping us

00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill the Scriptural commission

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:19

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:57.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples of people

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:00.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all [the] nations, baptizing them.”

The command to preach can be daunting,

00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:06.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in certain lands.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:09.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how are we meeting that challenge?

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Service Committee oversees

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:14.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work worldwide.

00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:18.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They help all to have a share according to their ability

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some as congregation publishers,

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:24.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others as full-time evangelizers.

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, special preaching campaigns

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:31.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and public witnessing
have resulted in many new Bible studies.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, though,

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our religious freedom

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:37.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is opposed by secular authorities.

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:42.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Coordinators’ Committee supervises

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:44.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the World Headquarters Legal Department.

00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:48.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many courts have handed down favorable decisions.

00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we must continue

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:54.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend our right to preach the good news.

00:08:56.098 --> 00:09:00.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our online tools are also
a huge help in making disciples.

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This counter shows the average rate

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at which people worldwide

00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:09.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are logging on to jw.org.®

00:09:09.027 --> 00:09:13.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day, some 250 Bible studies

00:09:13.615 --> 00:09:15.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are requested online.

00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:19.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Schools also help us to make disciples.

00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:22.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the Pioneer Service School,

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:26.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Gilead School.

00:09:27.796 --> 00:09:30.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you attended one of these schools?

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:32.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us know.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we come to the end of our tour,

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:38.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we hope you enjoyed some highlights

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this Faith in Action Museum.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’ve seen here reminds us

00:09:44.187 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that now and always

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:50.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people are a people of faith

00:09:50.694 --> 00:09:53.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—faith in action!

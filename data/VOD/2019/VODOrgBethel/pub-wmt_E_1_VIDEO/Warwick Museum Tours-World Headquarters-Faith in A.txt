00:00:29 Welcome to the World Headquarters
00:00:31 of Jehovah’s Witnesses at Warwick, New York.
00:00:35 As Jehovah’s people,
00:00:37 we are multicultural and multilingual.
00:00:40 And as the artwork here emphasizes, our focus
00:00:44 is on our commission to ‘preach the good news
00:00:47 to people of all nations.’
00:00:50 So, what are we doing today as an organization?
00:00:53 How did we get here?
00:00:55 And what’s our main tool for this great work?
00:00:59 We invite you to come tour our museums
00:01:02 to find out.
00:01:04 We have three museums here at Warwick,
00:01:07 all funded by voluntary donations.
00:01:11 Each of them is alive with stories.
00:01:14 Upstairs on the second floor
00:01:16 is the museum Faith in Action.
00:01:20 There we’ll see the very latest
00:01:22 on what’s being done by Jehovah’s organization.
00:01:26 Also on the second floor is the museum
00:01:29 A People for Jehovah’s Name.
00:01:32 It takes us on an exciting journey back in time.
00:01:36 And downstairs
00:01:38 we have the Bible Museum.
00:01:40 There we’ll get to see up close
00:01:43 a spiritual treasure chest.
00:01:46 When you tour the museums, you’ll notice that they
00:01:49 were designed to be, not passive, but interactive
00:01:54 so that you can put yourself in the experience.
00:01:57 So with that preview,
00:01:59 let’s take the tour.
00:02:06 This is the launching point to the Faith in Action Museum.
00:02:10 Note that important, descriptive word: “action.”
00:02:16 What activities, or actions,
00:02:18 are being organized and directed
00:02:20 by the Governing Body today?
00:02:22 This display acquaints you right away
00:02:25 with the work of the Governing Body committees.
00:02:27 Each committee has specific responsibilities,
00:02:31 but as you take the tour,
00:02:34 notice how the committees work together
00:02:37 to accomplish their goals.
00:02:39 The Faith in Action Museum
00:02:42 is divided into four galleries:
00:02:44 “Show Love,”
00:02:45 “Meet Together,”
00:02:48 “Take In Spiritual Food,”
00:02:51 and “Make Disciples.”
00:02:53 As you walk through the galleries,
00:02:54 notice how each of them is connected by a JW-blue ribbon.
00:02:59 So if you get lost,
00:03:01 just follow the blue ribbon.
00:03:05 This is the “Show Love” Gallery.
00:03:07 Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body
00:03:10 helps God’s people to ‘have love among themselves,’
00:03:13 as Jesus commanded at John 13:35.
00:03:17 For example,
00:03:19 how do the brothers at headquarters respond
00:03:22 to needs that arise when a disaster strikes?
00:03:25 When things like natural disasters,
00:03:28 terrorist attacks, or civil unrest occur,
00:03:32 the Coordinators’ Committee directs relief efforts.
00:03:36 They, in turn, communicate with the Branch Committee
00:03:39 that oversees the affected area.
00:03:41 Usually, within 48 hours,
00:03:44 a report of what’s occurred
00:03:47 and what’s being done to help our brothers
00:03:49 is compiled and sent to headquarters.
00:03:52 That report may be the basis for informing the brotherhood
00:03:55 through an article on jw.org®.
00:04:00 There’s another way that love is shown to Jehovah’s people
00:04:04 —schools.
00:04:06 Such schools as the School for Congregation Elders
00:04:09 and the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.
00:04:13 These have been very effective in training brothers
00:04:16 to shepherd the congregations lovingly.
00:04:21 The Teaching Committee is responsible for the curriculum,
00:04:24 while the Service Committee arranges for the selection of the students.
00:04:28 This is the “Meet Together” Gallery.
00:04:32 Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body is helping God’s people
00:04:36 to meet together “to incite
00:04:39 to love and fine works,” as directed
00:04:42 at Hebrews 10:24, 25.
00:04:45 How is the headquarters staff at Warwick filling that need?
00:04:49 Because we keep growing,
00:04:52 there’s an ongoing need
00:04:54 to build new Kingdom Halls and to renovate existing ones.
00:04:58 The Publishing Committee of the Governing Body
00:05:00 directs where Kingdom Halls will be built
00:05:03 and makes funds available to the branches.
00:05:06 The Publishing Committee
00:05:09 works closely with the branch office,
00:05:11 and its Local Design/Construction Department
00:05:14 carries out the work.
00:05:16 But where do these hardworking
00:05:18 brothers and sisters come from?
00:05:20 The Personnel Committee
00:05:22 appoints all construction servants
00:05:24 for assignments in their home country
00:05:26 or in a foreign land.
00:05:28 Have you worked on a theocratic building project?
00:05:32 Take our survey, and let us know.
00:05:36 Some Kingdom Halls are located in areas
00:05:38 where there is little or no electricity,
00:05:41 but that doesn’t stop us from meeting together.
00:05:44 The Publishing Committee
00:05:47 has arranged for a custom-built, portable sound system
00:05:50 to be used in these areas.
00:05:53 The unity player has a battery
00:05:55 that can be recharged by its solar panel
00:05:58 or with a built-in hand crank.
00:06:01 It’s a wonderful provision
00:06:04 that helps our brothers and sisters benefit more
00:06:06 from their congregation meetings.
00:06:09 This is the “Take In Spiritual Food” Gallery.
00:06:12 Can you guess what design we used?
00:06:15 That’s right, a dining table.
00:06:18 Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body
00:06:21 fulfills the Scriptural commission
00:06:23 at Luke 12:42
00:06:25 to feed God’s people spiritually.
00:06:28 To accomplish this,
00:06:31 millions of Bibles, books,
00:06:33 and other publications
00:06:35 need to be prepared, translated, and printed.
00:06:39 In addition,
00:06:41 a regular flow of material is released online.
00:06:45 Translators around the world
00:06:47 keep in close contact with Translation Services
00:06:50 —a headquarters department
00:06:52 that’s supervised by the Writing Committee.
00:06:55 Do you have a favorite publication?
00:06:58 Much more is involved than just the writing.
00:07:02 The section “From Start to Finish”
00:07:05 outlines 11 steps
00:07:07 that are taken to produce the final product.
00:07:10 What about our online spiritual food?
00:07:14 Each month, we look forward
00:07:16 to a new JW Broadcasting® program.
00:07:20 Once the Teaching Committee approves a video idea,
00:07:23 Audio/Video Services researches the subject
00:07:27 and prepares a script for final approval.
00:07:30 Approved scripts and storyboards
00:07:33 are assigned to video production teams around the world.
00:07:37 This gives our videos an international flavor.
00:07:42 Well, we’ve come to our final gallery, “Make Disciples.”
00:07:47 Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body is helping us
00:07:50 to fulfill the Scriptural commission
00:07:53 at Matthew 28:19
00:07:55 to “make disciples of people
00:07:57 of all [the] nations, baptizing them.”
00:08:01 The command to preach can be daunting,
00:08:04 especially in certain lands.
00:08:06 So how are we meeting that challenge?
00:08:09 The Service Committee oversees
00:08:12 the preaching work worldwide.
00:08:14 They help all to have a share according to their ability
00:08:18 —some as congregation publishers,
00:08:20 others as full-time evangelizers.
00:08:24 Additionally, special preaching campaigns
00:08:27 and public witnessing have resulted in many new Bible studies.
00:08:31 At times, though,
00:08:33 our religious freedom
00:08:35 is opposed by secular authorities.
00:08:37 So the Coordinators’ Committee supervises
00:08:42 the World Headquarters Legal Department.
00:08:44 Many courts have handed down favorable decisions.
00:08:48 Still, we must continue
00:08:51 to defend our right to preach the good news.
00:08:56 Our online tools are also a huge help in making disciples.
00:09:00 This counter shows the average rate
00:09:04 at which people worldwide
00:09:06 are logging on to jw.org.®
00:09:09 Each day, some 250 Bible studies
00:09:13 are requested online.
00:09:15 Schools also help us to make disciples.
00:09:19 We have the Pioneer Service School,
00:09:22 the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:09:24 and Gilead School.
00:09:27 Have you attended one of these schools?
00:09:30 Let us know.
00:09:33 Well, as we come to the end of our tour,
00:09:36 we hope you enjoyed some highlights
00:09:38 from this Faith in Action Museum.
00:09:41 What we’ve seen here reminds us
00:09:44 that now and always
00:09:46 Jehovah’s people are a people of faith
00:09:50 —faith in action!

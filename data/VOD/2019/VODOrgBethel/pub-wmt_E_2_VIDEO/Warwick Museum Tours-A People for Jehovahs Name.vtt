Do you enjoy a good story?

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you’re in for a special treat.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A People for Jehovah’s Name”

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters in Warwick
is more than a history museum.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:23.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the modern-day story of a people
seeking to know the true God

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to do his will.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this isn’t just any story

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s our story.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s take
a thrilling journey back in time.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story unfolds on the narrative wall

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in several galleries along the way.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin in the 1870’s,

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a small group
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania,

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided to reexamine the Bible.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As C. T. Russell reasoned:

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the creeds of Christendom

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
claim to be founded on the Bible;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these are conflicting.

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible that the Bible
has been misrepresented?

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more they learned,
the more they wanted to share.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1879,

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began publishing Zion’s Watch Tower.

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Readers were soon taking a stand
for the truths that they were learning.

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I want to tell you is this,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am free!

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth has made me free!

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To-day I was excluded
from the Baptist church . . .

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I am all alone in the ‘flesh,’
but not in the ‘spirit.’

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became known as the Bible Students,

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they soon realized that people
everywhere should hear the good news.

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:47.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how could this small group
preach the Bible’s message earthwide?

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Transcontinental and international tours

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped them to see how they could expand

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:56.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their preaching work even further.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:58.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just one tour

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:01.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning in December 1911,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
C. T. Russell and his associates

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:06.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveled completely around the world.

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:11.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s imagine what it was like
to live in those exciting times.

00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this gallery,
you can experience what life was like

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a pilgrim,
or what we today call a circuit overseer.

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a pilgrim’s formal jacket
that he’d wear when giving a public talk.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students offered the Studies
in the Scriptures series in the ministry.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they carried lists to locate

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visit Watch Tower subscribers.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1914,

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they presented
the exciting “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its purpose was to build faith in the Bible

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as God’s inspired Word.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an innovative combination

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of moving pictures,

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sound recordings,

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and beautiful, hand-colored glass slides.

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of people reenacted Bible scenes,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some with live animals!

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this enormous work worth all the effort?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL,
I want to thank you;

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:17.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oh, . . . so much, for the privilege

00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of seeing the PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION!

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:22.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never thought to live to see

00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the everlasting Gospel preached
to those who dwell on the earth . . . !

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet so it is.

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Words cannot tell you how my heart rejoices!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Your sister, F. E. Riley.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of 1914,
over nine million had viewed it.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with such success,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible Students didn’t realize
what tests lay ahead.

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:55.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Gentile Times have ended;

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their kings have had their day!

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know not what awaits us.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
World War I broke out in 1914.

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:10.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1916,

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:14.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the death of C. T. Russell
left the Bible Students in shock.

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a unique time of testing.

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:20.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside the organization,

00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:23.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some struggled over who should take the lead.

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outside,

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
governments tried to force them
to take sides in the war.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1918,

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:35.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
J. F. Rutherford
and seven of his close associates

00:04:35.587 --> 00:04:37.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were imprisoned.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:41.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this the end for the Bible Students?

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would they prove to be

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a people for Jehovah’s name?

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:49.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy that came
with the release of our brothers

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Atlanta Federal Prison on Tuesday,

00:04:52.312 --> 00:04:57.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
March 25, 1919, knew no bounds.

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their further devotion to Jehovah
was shown in the fact

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they immediately set to work to herald

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forth to the people of God everywhere

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the knowledge of Jehovah’s deliverance.

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:10.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Thomas Sullivan.

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students
moved forward with renewed zeal.

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:18.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the opposition didn’t end there.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:24.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this gallery,
you will see how our brothers and sisters

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:26.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have stood firm for their faith.

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:31.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Russia, a father imprisoned for ten years

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraged his young daughters

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with hand-drawn postcards.

00:05:35.814 --> 00:05:38.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Greece,

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:40.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a son used the same blanket in prison

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his father used
when imprisoned before him.

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an encouraging reminder
of his father’s integrity.

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:50.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Korea,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Witnesses were locked in tiny cells

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:56.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for up to 30 days at a time.

00:05:56.668 --> 00:06:01.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you stand in the lighted outline,
you get a sense of what it was like.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these brothers and sisters
looked beyond the prison bars

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:09.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their firm hope for the future.

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:13.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As light from God’s Word increased,

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible Students humbly let go

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cherished but unscriptural traditions.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:24.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Songs used in worship were examined
in the light of what the Bible taught.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people for Jehovah’s name
were becoming even more evident.

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:30.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1931,

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:34.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were thrilled to take on their new name

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:40.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1935,

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford identified
the great multitude of other sheep,

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:46.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who served alongside the anointed.

00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:50.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the climax of his talk, he asked:

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will all those who have the hope
of living forever on the earth please stand?

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:57.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this new understanding,

00:06:57.813 --> 00:07:02.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they saw the true scope
of Jesus’ commission to make disciples.

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:05.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New and innovative methods were needed.

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:12.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third gallery shows the preaching
methods used in the 1930’s and 1940’s.

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:17.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Radio was a powerful way
to spread the Kingdom message

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:19.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to large audiences.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:23.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also used large phonographs,

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:26.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called portable transcription machines,

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:28.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with loudspeakers mounted on sound cars.

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:33.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers played recorded talks
wherever people gathered.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lighter phonographs
were also designed and produced so publishers

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:43.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could take the recorded message
directly to people at home.

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:47.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These methods 
helped bring unity to the message,

00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the time had come to train each one

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s people
to be an effective Witness.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Schools were started.

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:58.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Course in Theocratic Ministry

00:07:58.498 --> 00:08:01.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trained publishers in the congregation.

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible School of Gilead

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:06.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began training missionaries
for global expansion.

00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:13.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had entered
into a new era of divine education.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we were about to receive an amazing tool.

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:20.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1950,

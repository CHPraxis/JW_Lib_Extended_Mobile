00:00:03 I work as a street cleaner;
00:00:06 either that or I do some other kind of work, like decorating
00:00:10 or system administration.
00:00:15 On April 20, they came to search
00:00:18 the home of my wife and me.
00:00:22 I was interrogated.
00:00:23 And after a month, a court ruled
00:00:25 to put me in pretrial detention.
00:00:35 When they lead me out of the courtroom in handcuffs . . .
00:00:42 . . . and put me into the vehicle,
00:00:44 Yelena (my wife) was at the exit.
00:00:48 From her words, I could sense
00:00:51 that she felt as though she was losing me.
00:01:03 They took me to the detention center in the city of Ivanovo.
00:01:08 They moved me from cell to cell.
00:01:11 And then they put me into what is known as the pressure cell.
00:01:17 They told me I had to admit my guilt
00:01:21 and tell them about my fellow worshippers
00:01:23 —give them names, addresses, what they do, etcetera.
00:01:31 For me, that would mean losing my loyalty to God.
00:01:35 And the second thing was that it involved my loyalty to my fellow worshippers.
00:01:40 In essence, it was about showing love.
00:01:43 I said that for me, loyalty to Jehovah is above everything else,
00:01:48 so whatever happens, I will remain loyal to God.
00:01:52 I told them openly, directly.
00:01:58 They pressured me physically and emotionally for several months.
00:02:09 They brought me a Bible from the detention center’s library.
00:02:15 Thanks to fervent prayers, I felt how Jehovah gave me
00:02:19 internal peace and calm.
00:02:21 It proves that Jehovah doesn’t just exist,
00:02:24 but he thinks about us; he cares for us.
00:02:29 Jehovah supported me through a letter from my dear wife.
00:02:33 In it was the thought that trusting in Jehovah
00:02:38 means seeing things the way he sees them.
00:02:43 The prisoners who put pressure on me
00:02:46 also expressed interest in spiritual things
00:02:49 and started asking questions relating to my beliefs.
00:02:55 Someone told me that if I am really a believer,
00:02:59 I should have objects to prove it, such as a cross, which all believers wear.
00:03:04 I told him that I could show him the Bible’s viewpoint.
00:03:08 From what I read, he made his own conclusions.
00:03:13 And after some time, this prisoner came up to me and showed me
00:03:16 that he wasn’t wearing a cross anymore.
00:03:20 When you are in prison,
00:03:22 the ministry isn’t just about opportunities
00:03:25 to tell people about the truth from the Bible.
00:03:29 It is more about Jehovah using it
00:03:31 to help you keep a positive outlook and maintain joy.
00:03:37 The more we concentrate on what we had before,
00:03:41 the more we suffer.
00:03:44 The quicker we accept the new circumstances,
00:03:46 the quicker our joy returns to us
00:03:50 along with the opportunity to make good use
00:03:53 of the new circumstances.
00:03:57 The appeal instance court ruled to release me.
00:04:01 It was, of course, quite an unexpected decision.
00:04:05 At the exit, my dear wife
00:04:08 and other fellow worshippers (brothers and sisters)
00:04:12 not just from my hometown but from other cities too met me.
00:04:19 Yelena and I thought it would be good to collect some essentials,
00:04:24 so we bought some things and went to the detention center.
00:04:28 And afterward, one of the prisoners
00:04:32 wrote me a letter of thanks:
00:04:34 “I heard how everyone came to meet you.
00:04:37 “I tried to imagine how cool it is
00:04:40 “to be loved, valued, and missed.
00:04:42 “For some, there’s not enough of that in life.
00:04:46 Take care of yourself, Dima!”
00:04:49 The letters from my wife were such a big support for me at that time.
00:04:54 To be honest, I saw her letters
00:04:57 as if it were Jehovah using her to speak to me.
00:05:03 “Nobody loves us as strongly as God.
00:05:06 “You can’t right now feel my love to the full extent
00:05:10 “or the love of your family and friends.
00:05:12 “But the main thing is that you are in God’s hands,
00:05:17 “and that is what’s more important.
00:05:19 “He loves you in a special way right now
00:05:22 “and very gently looks after you and cares for your feelings.
00:05:26 “By trusting in God,
00:05:28 “we can get a feeling of security, stability, and calmness.
00:05:33 “Our connection with God must be unbreakable.
00:05:37 “If our strength is in God,
00:05:39 “then we will overcome everything.
00:05:41 “Our suffering is just temporary,
00:05:44 and God will richly reward all who are loyal to him.”

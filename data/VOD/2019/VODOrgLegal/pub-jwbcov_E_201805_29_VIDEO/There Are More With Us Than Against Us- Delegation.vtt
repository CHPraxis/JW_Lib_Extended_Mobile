Well, I have the privilege of being part

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a delegation of brothers from 18 countries

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been assigned
by the Governing Body to attend

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court hearing
in Moscow on July 17.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principal objective is to just show
unity and support for our brothers.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to Russia
in order to be of encouragement

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the local Russian brothers and sisters there.

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will encourage them to continue

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘obey Jehovah as ruler rather than men.’

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our intent is to try and visit
many of the embassies

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speak to a variety of different high officials

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what’s happening right now

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:46.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brothers in Russia.

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, when you think of it,

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is almost a way of saying
that our international brotherhood

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:56.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is all coming to the defense,

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to the aid, of our brothers in Russia.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And actually, when you
think about it or when you meditate on it,

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really is a very, very beautiful thing.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has everything under control.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:13.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whatever the outcome may be,

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is no doubt that Jehovah

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue to strengthen our brothers.

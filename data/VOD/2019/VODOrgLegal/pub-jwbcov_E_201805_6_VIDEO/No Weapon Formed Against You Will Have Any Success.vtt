Jacob was 77 years old.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was unmarried
and hated by his twin brother, Esau.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the direction of his parents,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob fled to the land of Abraham’s relatives.

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he stopped to rest for the night,

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave Jacob
full assurance of divine support.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a dream, 
Jacob saw a ladder, or stairway,

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leading from earth to heaven.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angels were busily ascending
and descending the stairway.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah spoke to Jacob, saying:

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you,

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will safeguard you wherever you go.”

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah proved to be with Jacob,

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so He has been
with His people throughout history.

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From ancient times to our day,

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:14.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this world has tried to disturb
the peace that God’s people enjoy.

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:20.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cares for his people.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Guided by Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the support of the angels,

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are able to stand 
by our brothers and sisters under attack.

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
we feel as though we are standing

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:50.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one person against Satan’s attacks.

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:54.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is truly on our side!

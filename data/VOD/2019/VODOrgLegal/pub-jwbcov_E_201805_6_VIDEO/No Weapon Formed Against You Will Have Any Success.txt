00:00:01 Jacob was 77 years old.
00:00:05 He was unmarried and hated by his twin brother, Esau.
00:00:10 At the direction of his parents,
00:00:12 Jacob fled to the land of Abraham’s relatives.
00:00:17 When he stopped to rest for the night,
00:00:19 Jehovah gave Jacob full assurance of divine support.
00:00:25 In a dream,  Jacob saw a ladder, or stairway,
00:00:29 leading from earth to heaven.
00:00:31 Angels were busily ascending and descending the stairway.
00:00:36 Then Jehovah spoke to Jacob, saying:
00:00:38 “I am with you,
00:00:40 and I will safeguard you wherever you go.”
00:00:44 Just as Jehovah proved to be with Jacob,
00:00:48 so He has been with His people throughout history.
00:01:07 From ancient times to our day,
00:01:10 this world has tried to disturb the peace that God’s people enjoy.
00:02:15 Jehovah cares for his people.
00:02:31 Guided by Jehovah’s holy spirit
00:02:33 and with the support of the angels,
00:02:36 we are able to stand  by our brothers and sisters under attack.
00:02:42 As a result, we feel as though we are standing
00:02:46 as one person against Satan’s attacks.
00:02:50 Jehovah is truly on our side!

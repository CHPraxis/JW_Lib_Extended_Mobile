00:00:11 What fills you with enthusiasm?
00:00:14 Do you enjoy talking about tasty food?
00:00:17 Or do you speak with enthusiasm about the playful antics
00:00:20 of your little niece or nephew?
00:00:23 Reasons for enthusiasm vary from person to person.
00:00:27 But why might a speaker who loves Jehovah
00:00:31 and who believes what he’s saying lack enthusiasm when speaking?
00:00:37 It’s not enough just to prepare what to say.
00:00:41 We must get our heart involved,
00:00:43 think about our listeners,
00:00:45 and breathe life into our delivery.
00:00:49 This is important both in the congregation and in the ministry.
00:00:54 As you watch the following example, consider the question,
00:00:59 ‘Does this sister need more enthusiasm for her subject or less?’
00:01:05 The coming Paradise will be wonderful.
00:01:07 Notice just one of the prophecies in the Bible
00:01:09 regarding the abundant blessings God has promised.
00:01:12 It’s here at Isaiah 65:21, 22:
00:01:16 “They will build houses and live in them,
00:01:18 “and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.
00:01:20 “They will not build for someone else to inhabit,
00:01:22 nor will they plant for others to eat.”
00:01:24 So how did she do?
00:01:26 When we speak about the blessings of the new earth under God’s Kingdom,
00:01:31 we should brim with enthusiasm.
00:01:34 Enthusiasm is contagious.
00:01:37 Let’s watch another example.
00:01:41 The coming Paradise will be wonderful!
00:01:44 Notice just one of the prophecies in the Bible
00:01:47 regarding the abundant blessings God has promised.
00:01:50 It’s here at Isaiah 65:21, 22:
00:01:55 “They will build houses and live in them,
00:01:59 “and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.
00:02:02 “They will not build for someone else to inhabit,
00:02:05 “nor will they plant for others to eat.
00:02:08 “For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,
00:02:12 and the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”
00:02:18 Well done!
00:02:20 Our sister spoke from the heart and breathed life into her material.
00:02:26 It was evident in her tone of voice and facial expression.
00:02:30 Of course, we need to be balanced.
00:02:34 We could tire our listeners if we
00:02:36 project a high level of enthusiasm throughout our presentation.
00:02:42 To illustrate this, watch this brother giving a talk at the Kingdom Hall.
00:02:48 What prophetic events can we expect in the near future?
00:02:52 First, there will be a pronouncement of “peace and security.”
00:02:55 Then, the great tribulation will begin when the nations turn on Babylon the Great,
00:03:00 the world empire of false religion.
00:03:03 However, in harmony with the words of Matthew 24:22,
00:03:07 the attack will be cut short “on account of the chosen ones.”
00:03:11 What will happen next?
00:03:13 Gog of Magog, a coalition of nations, will attack God’s people.
00:03:17 Also, . . .
00:03:20 What do you think?
00:03:22 The speaker was clearly enthusiastic
00:03:25 —a bit too enthusiastic about the devastating events to come.
00:03:31 Also, our listeners will be distracted
00:03:34 if we use the same gesture repeatedly.
00:03:39 So we should try to make our gestures meaningful
00:03:42 and show enthusiasm primarily
00:03:45 when teaching main points
00:03:47 and when motivating our listeners to action.
00:03:50 Let’s give our brother another chance.
00:03:54 What prophetic events can we expect in the near future?
00:03:58 First, there will be a pronouncement of “peace and security.”
00:04:03 Then, the great tribulation will begin when the nations turn on Babylon the Great,
00:04:08 the world empire of false religion.
00:04:11 However, in harmony with the words of Matthew 24:22,
00:04:16 the attack will be cut short “on account of the chosen ones.”
00:04:19 What will happen next?
00:04:21 Gog of Magog, a coalition of nations, will attack God’s people.
00:04:26 But Jehovah will rescue his servants during Armageddon,
00:04:31 “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.”
00:04:34 So, what must we do now?
00:04:39 Romans 12:11 commands us to “be aglow with the spirit.”
00:04:45 By putting enthusiasm into our delivery,
00:04:48 we’ll stimulate and motivate our listeners to action.

What fills you with enthusiasm?

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you enjoy talking about tasty food?

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do you speak with enthusiasm
about the playful antics

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your little niece or nephew?

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reasons for enthusiasm
vary from person to person.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why might a speaker who loves Jehovah

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who believes what he’s saying
lack enthusiasm when speaking?

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not enough just to prepare what to say.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must get our heart involved,

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about our listeners,

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and breathe life into our delivery.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is important both in the congregation
and in the ministry.

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:59.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following example,
consider the question,

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:04.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Does this sister need
more enthusiasm for her subject or less?’

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The coming Paradise will be wonderful.

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice just one
of the prophecies in the Bible

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the abundant blessings
God has promised.

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here at Isaiah 65:21, 22:

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will build houses and live in them,

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will they plant for others to eat.”

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did she do?

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we speak about the blessings
of the new earth under God’s Kingdom,

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should brim with enthusiasm.

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enthusiasm is contagious.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch another example.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The coming Paradise will be wonderful!

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice just one
of the prophecies in the Bible

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the abundant blessings
God has promised.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here at Isaiah 65:21, 22:

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will build houses and live in them,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:08.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well done!

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister spoke from the heart
and breathed life into her material.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was evident
in her tone of voice and facial expression.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we need to be balanced.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could tire our listeners if we

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
project a high level of enthusiasm
throughout our presentation.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate this, watch this brother
giving a talk at the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:52.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What prophetic events
can we expect in the near future?

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there will be a pronouncement
of “peace and security.”

00:02:55.988 --> 00:03:00.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, the great tribulation will begin
when the nations turn on Babylon the Great,

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:03.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world empire of false religion.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:07.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in harmony
with the words of Matthew 24:22,

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the attack will be cut short
“on account of the chosen ones.”

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will happen next?

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog of Magog, a coalition of nations,
will attack God’s people.

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, . . .

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:22.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speaker was clearly enthusiastic

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a bit too enthusiastic
about the devastating events to come.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, our listeners will be distracted

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:38.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we use the same gesture repeatedly.

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we should try to make
our gestures meaningful

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show enthusiasm primarily

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when teaching main points

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when motivating our listeners to action.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give our brother another chance.

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What prophetic events
can we expect in the near future?

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there will be a pronouncement
of “peace and security.”

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:08.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, the great tribulation will begin
when the nations turn on Babylon the Great,

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:11.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world empire of false religion.

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in harmony
with the words of Matthew 24:22,

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the attack will be cut short
“on account of the chosen ones.”

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:21.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will happen next?

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog of Magog, a coalition of nations,
will attack God’s people.

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:31.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah will rescue
his servants during Armageddon,

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:34.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the war of the great day
of God the Almighty.”

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:37.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what must we do now?

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:44.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:11 commands us
to “be aglow with the spirit.”

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:48.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By putting enthusiasm into our delivery,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll stimulate and motivate
our listeners to action.

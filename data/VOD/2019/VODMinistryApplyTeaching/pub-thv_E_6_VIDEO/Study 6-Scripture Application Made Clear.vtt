Our audience
needs to see the connection

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:16.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the scriptures
that we read and the point we’re making.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:20.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can accomplish this
when we introduce a scripture

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that draws attention
to the main point

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then emphasize key words
as we read the text.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not always enough

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the audience to grasp
the application of the scripture.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, after reading the text,

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important to offer an explanation,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if the scripture is familiar to the audience.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:45.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can make the application clear by

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isolating key words,

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by explaining how those words

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relate to our reason for reading the text,

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by not complicating
the application with irrelevant details.

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate, see if you can discern

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the following speaker succeeds

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where he fails
in making scripture application clear.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many churches baptize people

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sprinkling water on them.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this how baptisms should be done?

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read how Jesus was baptized

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:22.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Mark 1:9, 10.

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for the answer to this question:

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was baptized,
was he sprinkled with water?

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the course of those days,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee
and was baptized in the Jordan by John.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:42.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And immediately
 on coming up out of the water,

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw the heavens being parted

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, like a dove,
the spirit coming down upon him.”

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another popular practice
in Christendom is infant baptism.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:00.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speaker just moved on to the next point.

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a good introduction,
and he read with proper emphasis,

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he took no time to make the application.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:11.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t give the audience time to reflect

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the meaning of what they just read.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give him another chance.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And immediately
on coming up out of the water,

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw the heavens being parted

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, like a dove,
the spirit coming down upon him.”

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that verse 10 says that Jesus

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came “up out of the water.”

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that he had been

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely immersed in the river.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:45.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus was not merely
sprinkled with water, was he?

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Christians
try to follow Jesus’ steps closely,

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t it be reasonable
that Christian baptism

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would entail complete immersion
and not mere sprinkling?

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another popular practice
in Christendom is infant baptism.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that the speaker did not comment

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on unrelated details of the verses he read.

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he didn’t elaborate
on the end of verse 10

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it didn’t contribute to the main point.

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether you’re teaching
from the platform or in the ministry,

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help your listeners to see clearly
the connection between the scripture you read

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the point you’re making.

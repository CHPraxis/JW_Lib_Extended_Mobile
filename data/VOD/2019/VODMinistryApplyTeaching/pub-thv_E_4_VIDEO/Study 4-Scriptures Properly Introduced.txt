00:00:11 Why give attention to the way you introduce a scripture?
00:00:15 Because the promises of God,
00:00:17 which we find in his written Word, have tremendous power.
00:00:22 Hebrews 4:12 says:
00:00:24 “The word of God is alive and exerts power
00:00:28 “and is sharper than any two-edged sword
00:00:31 “and pierces even to the dividing  of soul and spirit,
00:00:36 “and of joints from the marrow,
00:00:38 and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.”
00:00:42 Yes, God’s Word has the power to reach a person’s heart,
00:00:47 so we should always use it as the basis for our teaching.
00:00:51 But first, we should ensure that our listeners
00:00:54 are properly focused on those inspired words.
00:00:57 How might you do that?
00:01:00 Indicate what the text will reveal,
00:01:03 cite the Bible as God’s Word,
00:01:06 and say something that will make the listeners want to read the verse.
00:01:10 In the following demonstration,
00:01:12 see if the speaker accomplishes any of those goals.
00:01:17 Please turn to Psalm 55:22.
00:01:20 Even though we have read this many times before,
00:01:23 let’s read it again:
00:01:26 “Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.
00:01:30 Never will he allow the righteous one to fall.”
00:01:35 Although a Kingdom Hall audience
00:01:37 will likely turn to a scripture because you invite them to,
00:01:41 this audience didn’t know why the scripture was being read,
00:01:44 nor did the speaker give them any reason to be especially interested in what it says.
00:01:50 How might the speaker properly introduce a Bible verse?
00:01:54 There are a few ways to do this.
00:01:57 First, he could ask a question that the scripture will answer.
00:02:00 Let’s watch an example of that.
00:02:03 When a problem is so severe
00:02:06 that it seems you can think of nothing else,
00:02:09 what can you do?
00:02:11 The answer is found at Psalm 55:22.
00:02:17 Or the speaker could pose a problem that the scripture will help to solve.
00:02:23 Imagine that your marriage mate or a fellow believer
00:02:27 has said or done something hurtful to you.
00:02:31 The Bible tells us how not to respond
00:02:34 at Romans 12:17, 18.
00:02:37 Notice what it says.
00:02:40 Another good way to introduce Bible accounts is
00:02:43 by stating a principle that the account will illustrate.
00:02:48 We can avoid many problems by following divine instructions.
00:02:53 Please turn to 2 Samuel 6:2-7
00:02:57 and notice what happened when David
00:03:00 didn’t follow the proper procedure
00:03:03 for transporting the ark of the covenant.
00:03:06 What else must we do to introduce scriptures properly,
00:03:11 especially when our audience includes unbelievers?
00:03:14 Cite God’s Word as the authority.
00:03:18 Watch the following demonstration,
00:03:21 and see if you can discern how the publisher might improve
00:03:24 in drawing attention to the scripture.
00:03:28 Will crime and wickedness always exist?
00:03:32 David gives us the answer here at Psalm 37:10, 11.
00:03:38 The publisher aroused interest in what she was about to read
00:03:42 by raising a question,
00:03:44 and she correctly identified David as the writer.
00:03:48 Although it’s not wrong to mention the name of the Bible writer,
00:03:52 in this case the householder might have wondered, ‘Who is David?’
00:03:57 And even if she knew who David was,
00:04:00 she might have viewed his words as an ancient human opinion.
00:04:04 Let’s see how the sister could introduce this scripture
00:04:07 in a way that inspires more confidence in its reliability.
00:04:12 Will crime and wickedness always exist?
00:04:15 God’s Word gives us the answer
00:04:18 here at Psalm 37:10, 11.
00:04:22 So before reading a scripture,
00:04:25 do more than simply tell your audience
00:04:28 where it can be found and invite them to follow along.
00:04:31 Indicate the key point it will make,
00:04:34 and say something to make your listeners want to read it.
00:04:38 Especially when speaking to unbelievers,
00:04:41 introduce the scripture in a way that indicates its authority.
00:04:46 By doing these things, you can prepare the minds of your listeners
00:04:50 for the important words that you’ll read.

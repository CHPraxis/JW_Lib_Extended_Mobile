00:00:10 Speaking in a conversational manner
00:00:12 means talking in a natural, sincere way
00:00:16 that conveys how you feel.
00:00:18 While this might sound simple,
00:00:21 it can be a challenge when you’re nervous.
00:00:24 These four steps can help:
00:00:28 pray,
00:00:29 prepare carefully,
00:00:32 speak from the heart,
00:00:35 and look at your listeners.
00:00:37 This is important when we give talks
00:00:40 and when we share in the ministry;
00:00:42 let’s see why as we watch
00:00:45 these examples of public witnessing.
00:00:52 Take whatever you want. There’s no charge.
00:00:55 Oh, that’s OK. Maybe another time.
00:01:00 Could the brother’s manner have been more conversational?
00:01:04 Well, he could have tried to make eye contact.
00:01:08 What about his posture, gestures, and facial expressions?
00:01:15 Let’s watch a better example.
00:01:18 Good morning.
00:01:19 Good morning.
00:01:20 You’re welcome to take whatever you like.
00:01:22 Thank you.
00:01:26 Do you think we’ll ever see an end to suffering?
00:01:29 I’m not really sure.
00:01:31 If you have just a moment, I’d like to show you what the Bible has to say.
00:01:34 OK.
00:01:36 A friendly manner opened the way to a conversation.
00:01:41 It can also help when we’re giving a talk.
00:01:43 We should try to speak in our own words.
00:01:48 Let’s observe these examples.
00:01:51 When Jesus was nailed to the stake in 33 C.E.,
00:01:55 it hardly looked possible that he could have a kingdom at all.
00:02:00 But in his preaching of the Kingdom of God,
00:02:02 he had not been a proclaimer of erroneous news.
00:02:06 On the third day after his death, the Founder of the Kingdom made sure
00:02:10 that the disciples of Jesus would not be offering up prayer
00:02:14 for a government that was not possible.
00:02:17 Jehovah resurrected the One who was to represent Him
00:02:20 in the prayed-for Kingdom and clothed him with immortality.
00:02:26 Did you understand the words of the speaker?
00:02:29 Most likely.
00:02:31 Was it spiritual food?
00:02:33 Yes.
00:02:35 Was he using conversational manner?
00:02:39 Not really.
00:02:41 Could he have had more eye contact with his audience?
00:02:45 Yes.
00:02:47 Let’s watch the speaker present the information in his own words.
00:02:54 Jesus preached about God’s Kingdom
00:02:57 and taught his followers to pray for it.
00:03:00 But when he died in 33 C.E.,
00:03:04 they may have wondered if the Kingdom really would come.
00:03:10 Any doubts they had were erased three days later
00:03:14 when Jehovah resurrected his Son,
00:03:16 the future King of his Kingdom.
00:03:20 A natural, sincere delivery is more appealing.
00:03:25 It holds people’s attention, puts them at ease,
00:03:29 and makes them more receptive to what you have to say.

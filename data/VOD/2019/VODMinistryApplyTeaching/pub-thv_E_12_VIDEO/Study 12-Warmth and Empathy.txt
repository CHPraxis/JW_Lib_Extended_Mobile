00:00:10 The apostle Paul wrote to Christians in Thessalonica:
00:00:14 “We became gentle in your midst,
00:00:17 “as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.
00:00:22 “So having tender affection for you,
00:00:25 “we were determined to impart to you,
00:00:27 “not only the good news of God but also our very selves,
00:00:31 because you became so beloved to us.”
00:00:35 Paul cared,
00:00:37 and his fellow believers could sense that by the way he spoke to them.
00:00:41 This made his teaching more effective.
00:00:44 Likewise, if our audience feels that we genuinely care for them
00:00:49 —that we’re not there simply to deliver information or fulfill an assignment—
00:00:54 they’ll be more likely to listen and respond.
00:00:58 So how can we show genuine warmth and empathy?
00:01:03 We need to think about our listeners.
00:01:06 For example, before going in the ministry,
00:01:09 reflect on specific problems that people in the territory are concerned about.
00:01:14 What are their beliefs?
00:01:16 Try to imagine how they feel.
00:01:19 When preparing a talk,
00:01:21 remind yourself of what your brothers and sisters may be facing
00:01:24 and how you can encourage them.
00:01:28 Then use expressions that refresh,
00:01:31 comfort, and invigorate your listeners.
00:01:35 Be careful not to speak disparagingly of people or their beliefs.
00:01:40 When conversing with older people or those in authority,
00:01:44 use words that show respect.
00:01:47 Let’s watch a brother giving a public talk.
00:01:51 Do his words show empathy for his audience?
00:01:55 The evolution theory is very popular today.
00:01:59 But it’s hard to understand how intelligent people
00:02:02 could believe such an illogical theory.
00:02:05 Many believe it simply because so-called educated people do,
00:02:10 including many scientists.
00:02:12 So how can we help them to examine matters for themselves
00:02:16 and see how ridiculous evolution is?
00:02:20 If someone in the audience believed in evolution,
00:02:23 how would he feel?
00:02:25 Let’s watch the speaker try again
00:02:28 but this time with more empathy.
00:02:32 The evolution theory is very popular today.
00:02:35 But why do many people believe it?
00:02:38 Perhaps they were taught evolution in school
00:02:42 and were offered no other plausible explanation.
00:02:45 How can we help people  to examine the facts for themselves?
00:02:51 This time, the speaker didn’t insult people because of their viewpoint.
00:02:55 At the same time, he aroused interest in additional facts
00:02:59 that are worthy of consideration.
00:03:02 What else can indicate warmth and empathy?
00:03:06 Tone—not just what you say
00:03:10 but how you say it.
00:03:13 A warm tone of voice
00:03:15 along with appropriate gestures and facial expressions
00:03:18 shows sincere interest.
00:03:21 Let’s watch a publisher in the house-to-house ministry.
00:03:25 Does she show interest by the way she speaks?
00:03:30 I’m sorry. I can’t talk to you today.
00:03:32 I just lost my mother, and I’m meeting with the funeral director this afternoon.
00:03:37 I’m sorry. It’s so painful when a loved one dies.
00:03:40 When I lost my mother a few years ago,
00:03:43 I found some Bible verses to be very comforting.
00:03:49 Although there was nothing wrong with what our sister said,
00:03:52 her delivery lacked warmth and empathy.
00:03:56 Let’s give her a second chance.
00:04:00 I’m sorry. It’s so painful when a loved one dies.
00:04:04 When I lost my mother a few years ago,
00:04:07 I found some Bible verses to be very comforting.
00:04:11 Some of them are in this tract.
00:04:14 But maybe we can discuss them briefly another time.
00:04:19 Our sister said exactly the same thing,
00:04:22 but this time she spoke with emotion,
00:04:26 and so her words were more effective.
00:04:29 When we speak with genuine emotion,
00:04:32 we show our listeners that we care.
00:04:35 But be careful not to force or exaggerate emotions.
00:04:39 If you’re reading a scripture,
00:04:41 try to express the feelings indicated in the passage,
00:04:45 but don’t draw undue attention to yourself.
00:04:49 So by thinking about your listeners,
00:04:52 choosing your words carefully, and showing your interest,
00:04:56 you’ll refresh, comfort, and invigorate your listeners.

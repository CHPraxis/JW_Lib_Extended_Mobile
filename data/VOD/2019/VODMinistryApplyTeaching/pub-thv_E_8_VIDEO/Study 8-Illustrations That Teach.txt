00:00:10 Illustrations are powerful teaching tools.
00:00:14 They help to explain complex ideas.
00:00:17 They also stimulate thinking and can break down prejudice.
00:00:22 Illustrations stir emotions and appeal to the heart.
00:00:27 They’re also memory aids.
00:00:30 It’s no wonder, then, that Jesus made good use of them.
00:00:36 Here are three things that will make your illustrations effective:
00:00:41 Select simple illustrations,
00:00:44 choose them with your listeners in mind,
00:00:48 and use them to teach the points that are truly important.
00:00:52 Listen to the following illustration, and see if it’s effective.
00:00:58 “Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire,
00:01:02 but the one who does the will of God remains forever.”
00:01:07 If the world is passing away
00:01:09 and life in this system of things is temporary,
00:01:13 shouldn’t that affect how we use our time and energy?
00:01:16 For example, imagine you’re going on a seven-day, European cruise.
00:01:21 The ports of call are Lisbon, Gibraltar,
00:01:25 Barcelona, Monte Carlo, Florence, and Rome.
00:01:30 Because the ship will have many activities, you’ve chosen an inside cabin.
00:01:35 Although the room is nicely decorated,
00:01:38 it’s not exactly your taste.
00:01:41 For example, you don’t like the brightly colored carpet and walls
00:01:45 that are common on many cruise ships.
00:01:47 Also, the bedspread and curtains are not what you would’ve chosen.
00:01:52 You have a refrigerator in the room, but it’s small.
00:01:56 Would you spend time redecorating the room
00:01:59 —maybe put down a new carpet,
00:02:01 paint the room a different color,
00:02:03 hang new curtains, or purchase a larger refrigerator?
00:02:08 Of course not!
00:02:10 Your stay is only temporary.
00:02:13 Similarly,  our stay in this system of things is only temporary.
00:02:18 Does it make sense that we would spend time and energy
00:02:22 to make our life as comfortable as possible?
00:02:26 Although this illustration made a good point,
00:02:29 was it as effective as it could have been?
00:02:32 Was it simple?
00:02:34 Well, was it necessary for the audience to know the reason for the trip,
00:02:39 how long the cruise was, or the cities where the ship was stopping?
00:02:43 No.
00:02:44 These details actually complicated the illustration.
00:02:48 Here’s something else:
00:02:50 Did the speaker have his listeners in mind?
00:02:54 Probably few in his audience have taken a cruise,
00:02:58 so it would be hard for them to identify with the situation.
00:03:02 Therefore, the point of the illustration could be lost,
00:03:05 or their minds might be diverted to the speaker
00:03:09 rather than his message.
00:03:11 How might the speaker have illustrated the same point more effectively?
00:03:16 Let’s watch him try again.
00:03:20 “Furthermore,  the world is passing away and so is its desire,
00:03:25 but the one who does the will of God remains forever.”
00:03:30 If the world is passing away
00:03:32 and our life in this system of things is temporary,
00:03:35 shouldn’t that affect how we use our time and energy?
00:03:40 For example, imagine that you’re visiting relatives
00:03:43 in another village for a few days.
00:03:45 They kindly give you a room.
00:03:47 However, the bed is not as comfortable as yours.
00:03:53 The walls could use a few more pictures, and there’s no window.
00:03:57 Would you purchase a larger bed for your stay
00:04:00 and some pictures for the walls?
00:04:03 Or would you take time to install a window?
00:04:05 Of course not!
00:04:07 You’re only staying a few days.
00:04:10 We might relocate the chairs and tables and a few simple things
00:04:15 to make our surroundings more comfortable during our temporary stay,
00:04:19 but we would not go to great effort or expense
00:04:22 to redecorate the entire room.
00:04:25 In like manner,
00:04:27 we keep matters simple during our temporary residency in this old system,
00:04:32 giving our main focus to Kingdom interests.
00:04:37 Jesus’ illustrations were simple.
00:04:40 For example:
00:04:42 “The Kingdom of the heavens is like leaven that a woman took
00:04:46 “and mixed with three large measures of flour
00:04:49 until the whole mass was fermented.”
00:04:52 It’s just one sentence about baking bread,
00:04:55 a situation familiar to his audience.
00:04:59 This simplicity made Jesus’ illustrations appeal to the heart.
00:05:05 Jesus also used illustrations
00:05:07 to teach main points, not minor details.
00:05:11 So use illustrations selectively.
00:05:14 If you were to use an illustration to teach a minor detail,
00:05:18 your audience may remember the illustration
00:05:21 but not the point of instruction.
00:05:23 How can you find appropriate illustrations?
00:05:26 Be observant.
00:05:28 Look at the world around you,
00:05:31 study our Christian publications,
00:05:33 and listen to skilled teachers.
00:05:36 Some experienced teachers save illustrations in a file to use later.
00:05:41 If you want to teach like Jesus,
00:05:44 enhance your teaching with simple illustrations that appeal to your listeners
00:05:49 and that teach main points.

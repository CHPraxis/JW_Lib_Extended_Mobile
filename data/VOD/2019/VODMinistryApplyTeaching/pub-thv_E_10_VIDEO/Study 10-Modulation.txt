00:00:10 The human voice is a marvelous instrument,
00:00:14 capable of great variety.
00:00:17 When we vary our volume, pitch, and pace
00:00:21 so as to convey ideas clearly and stir emotion,
00:00:25 we’re using modulation.
00:00:28 Why is modulation important when speaking?
00:00:32 For the same reason it’s important when playing a musical instrument.
00:00:37 How would music sound without modulation?
00:00:53 It’s not very appealing, is it?
00:00:55 Now let’s vary the volume.
00:01:09 Let’s also add changes in pace.
00:01:24 Finally, let’s add variations in pitch.
00:01:40 When the musician varied the volume,
00:01:43 pace, and pitch,
00:01:45 the result was something pleasurable to listen to.
00:01:49 To illustrate the importance of doing this when we speak,
00:01:54 let’s listen as a speaker presents fine information
00:01:58 but with little modulation.
00:02:02 After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness,
00:02:05 the Israelites are on the verge of a momentous change.
00:02:08 They’re about to take possession of the Promised Land.
00:02:11 Tents will be replaced by houses.
00:02:14 Manna will be replaced by meat and vegetables.
00:02:17 At last, they will be able to worship Jehovah
00:02:20 as a free and spiritually clean people.
00:02:22 Still, challenges awaited them.
00:02:25 What would Moses say shortly before his death
00:02:27 to encourage and prepare them?
00:02:29 Let’s find out by reading Deuteronomy 31:7, 8.
00:02:35 We stopped the speaker before he read the scripture
00:02:39 and finished making the point
00:02:41 because he was difficult to listen to.
00:02:45 Let’s watch him try again, but this time,
00:02:49 he varies his volume,
00:02:51 pitch, and pace.
00:02:55 After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness,
00:02:59 the Israelites are on the verge of a momentous change.
00:03:03 They’re about to take possession of the Promised Land.
00:03:07 Tents will be replaced by houses.
00:03:09 Manna will be replaced by meat and vegetables.
00:03:13 At last, they’ll be able to worship Jehovah
00:03:16 as a free and spiritually clean people.
00:03:20 Still, challenges awaited them.
00:03:23 But what would Moses say shortly before his death
00:03:27 to encourage and prepare them?
00:03:31 Let’s find out by reading Deuteronomy 31:7, 8:
00:03:39 “Moses then called Joshua and said to him
00:03:42 “before the eyes of all Israel:
00:03:44 “‘Be courageous and strong,
00:03:47 “‘for you are the one who will bring this people
00:03:50 “‘into the land that Jehovah swore
00:03:53 “‘to their forefathers to give to them,
00:03:55 “‘and you will give it to them as an inheritance.
00:03:58 “‘Jehovah is the one marching before you,
00:04:02 “‘and he will continue with you.
00:04:04 “‘He will neither desert you nor abandon you.
00:04:07 Do not be afraid or be terrified.’”
00:04:12 It was much better, wasn’t it?
00:04:15 Did you notice how the speaker built anticipation
00:04:18 for the scripture by lowering his volume as he asked:
00:04:22 “What would Moses say shortly before his death
00:04:26 to encourage and prepare them?”
00:04:29 Then he increased his volume
00:04:32 when reading Moses’ exhortation.
00:04:35 If we strive to read and speak with modulation,
00:04:40 we’ll convey the ideas more clearly
00:04:43 and stir the emotion of our listeners.

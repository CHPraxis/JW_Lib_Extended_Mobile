To convey Bible truth correctly,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must read from the Bible

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:18.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our Christian publications accurately.

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do this, we must prepare well,

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pronounce each word correctly,

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speak clearly.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:31.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our brother reads Matthew 24:43, 44,

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:34.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to identify
some common mistakes made in reading.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that question,
notice what the Bible says at Matthew 24:43, 44:

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But know one more thing: If the housekeeper
had known when the thief was comin,’

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he woulda kept awake and not allowed
his house to be broken in two.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On this account,
you two prove yourselves ready,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Son of God is comin’
at an hour that you do not think it to be.”

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that the householder

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might have been distracted by the reading?

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely.

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Making any of these errors could convey

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lack of respect for the material

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or change the meaning of the verse.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a better example.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that question,
notice what the Bible says at Matthew 24:43, 44:

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But know one thing:

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:23.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the householder
had known in what watch the thief was coming,

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he would have kept awake

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and not allowed his house to be broken into.

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:32.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On this account, you too
prove yourselves ready,

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Son of man is coming
at an hour that you do not think to be it.”

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much better!

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To become effective at reading aloud,

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should work to develop good habits
in our personal reading.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strive to understand the meaning

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to observe all punctuation marks.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, at Matthew 8:3,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not say to the leper:

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to be made clean,”

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather: “I want to! Be made clean.”

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Running through the exclamation point

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely changes the meaning.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other verses,
we have to emphasize the right words

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to convey the intended meaning.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:20.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, how would you read 1 John 2:1?

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My little children, I am writing you these things

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may not commit a sin.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And yet, if anyone does commit a sin,

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have a helper with the Father,
Jesus Christ, a righteous one.”

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the brother stressed the word “father,”

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave the impression
that Jesus Christ is the Father,

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:45.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was clearly not the writer’s intent.

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:48.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give our brother another chance.

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:51.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My little children, I am writing you these things

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may not commit a sin.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:57.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And yet, if anyone does commit a sin,

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have a helper with the Father,

00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus Christ, a righteous one.”

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the speaker made it clear

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the helper is Jesus Christ.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should also be careful
not to place undue emphasis on function words,

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as prepositions and conjunctions.

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
at 1 Timothy 4:16, instead of reading

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will save both yourself
and those who listen to you,”

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:32.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not emphasize the verb
to convey the full meaning of the text?

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will save both yourself
and those who listen to you.”

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, there is more to accurate reading

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than simply pronouncing words correctly,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet even that can be a challenge at times.

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:50.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where can you find help
to pronounce a word or name correctly

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even Bible names?

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can look them up in a dictionary,

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listen to an audio recording of the publication,

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ask a good reader for help.

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accurate reading adds to the dignity
of the message we preach.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:10.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It allows our listener to focus on the message

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:13.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than be sidetracked by any mistakes.

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:18.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most important, it honors Jehovah God.

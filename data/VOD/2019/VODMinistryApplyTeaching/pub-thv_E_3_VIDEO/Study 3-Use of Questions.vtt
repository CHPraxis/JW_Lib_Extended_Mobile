Why are questions so effective?

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they encourage our audience

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think actively
instead of listening passively.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can ask rhetorical questions
to maintain interest,

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can pose a series
of questions to reason on a subject

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lead our listeners
to a logical conclusion,

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:36.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can ask intriguing questions
to introduce key ideas

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or use review questions
to conclude our presentation.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why use rhetorical questions?

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:47.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s watch
what happens when we don’t.

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 6:23 says:

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:56.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the wages sin pays is death,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the gift God gives

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is everlasting life
by Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gift of the ransom came from Jehovah.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned,

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah stated a solution

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would offer hope to all of their offspring.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He purposed that one

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his spirit creatures come to the earth,

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:29.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
live as a perfect human,

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:33.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ultimately offer his life as a ransom.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it’s often easier
to explain a Bible text,

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
questions make our teaching

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:42.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more interesting and effective.

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watch as the speaker
teaches the same point

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using rhetorical questions.

00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:52.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 6:23 says:

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the wages sin pays is death,

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the gift God gives

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is everlasting life
by Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jesus is the one
who suffered and died for us,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why does the verse speak of the ransom

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:15.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the gift God gives”?

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not “the gift [Jesus] gives”?

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what we know

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the book of Genesis.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned,

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah stated a solution

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would offer hope to all of their offspring.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He purposed that one

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his spirit creatures come to the earth,

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
live as a perfect human,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ultimately offer his life as a ransom.

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is another way too in which

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ransom was a gift from God.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought
of what God must have felt

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus was put to death?

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than simply stating the truth,

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the speaker stimulated interest

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by posing a question
that prompted his audience to think.

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also use questions
in the ministry

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:13.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help people we meet
reason on a subject.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in on a return visit.

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that I heard a loud voice

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the throne say: ‘Look!

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The tent of God is with mankind,

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and he will reside with them,
and they will be his people.

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And God himself will be with them.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:36.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And he will wipe out
every tear from their eyes,

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and death will be no more,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:43.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘neither will mourning
nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:46.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former things have passed away.’”

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to this prophecy,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can we look forward to?

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we’re angels in heaven,

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:57.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we won’t have any more pain or death.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good that the question prompted

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a response from the householder.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, how can the publisher

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:07.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use questions
to lead the householder

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the correct understanding
of these verses?

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, God is going to end pain and death.

00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where will this take place?

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse says that pain
and death “will be no more.”

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where do pain and death exist today?

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In heaven or on earth?

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than simply correcting
the wrong thought,

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publisher used questions
to help the householder reason

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Scriptures
and come to the right conclusion.

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:46.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good teaching involves
more than just relating information.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we use tactful questions
to maintain interest,

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reason with our listeners,

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:55.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to emphasize important points,

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:59.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we imitate
the Grand Instructor, Jehovah God,

00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Great Teacher, Jesus Christ.

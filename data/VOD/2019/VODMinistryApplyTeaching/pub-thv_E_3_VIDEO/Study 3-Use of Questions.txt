00:00:10 Why are questions so effective?
00:00:13 Because they encourage our audience
00:00:16 to think actively instead of listening passively.
00:00:20 We can ask rhetorical questions to maintain interest,
00:00:24 we can pose a series of questions to reason on a subject
00:00:28 and lead our listeners to a logical conclusion,
00:00:32 and we can ask intriguing questions to introduce key ideas
00:00:36 or use review questions to conclude our presentation.
00:00:41 Why use rhetorical questions?
00:00:43 Well, let’s watch what happens when we don’t.
00:00:47 Romans 6:23 says:
00:00:52 “For the wages sin pays is death,
00:00:56 “but the gift God gives
00:00:58 is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”
00:01:05 The gift of the ransom came from Jehovah.
00:01:09 Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned,
00:01:12 Jehovah stated a solution
00:01:16 that would offer hope to all of their offspring.
00:01:20 He purposed that one
00:01:22 of his spirit creatures come to the earth,
00:01:26 live as a perfect human,
00:01:29 and ultimately offer his life as a ransom.
00:01:34 Although it’s often easier to explain a Bible text,
00:01:38 questions make our teaching
00:01:40 more interesting and effective.
00:01:43 Watch as the speaker teaches the same point
00:01:46 using rhetorical questions.
00:01:50 Romans 6:23 says:
00:01:54 “For the wages sin pays is death,
00:01:57 “but the gift God gives
00:01:59 is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”
00:02:05 If Jesus is the one who suffered and died for us,
00:02:09 why does the verse speak of the ransom
00:02:12 as “the gift God gives”?
00:02:15 Why not “the gift [Jesus] gives”?
00:02:18 Consider what we know
00:02:20 from the book of Genesis.
00:02:23 Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned,
00:02:25 Jehovah stated a solution
00:02:28 that would offer hope to all of their offspring.
00:02:32 He purposed that one
00:02:34 of his spirit creatures come to the earth,
00:02:37 live as a perfect human,
00:02:39 and ultimately offer his life as a ransom.
00:02:44 There is another way too in which
00:02:47 the ransom was a gift from God.
00:02:50 Have you ever thought of what God must have felt
00:02:53 when Jesus was put to death?
00:02:57 Rather than simply stating the truth,
00:03:00 the speaker stimulated interest
00:03:02 by posing a question that prompted his audience to think.
00:03:07 We can also use questions in the ministry
00:03:10 to help people we meet reason on a subject.
00:03:13 Let’s look in on a return visit.
00:03:18 “With that I heard a loud voice
00:03:20 “from the throne say: ‘Look!
00:03:22 “‘The tent of God is with mankind,
00:03:25 “‘and he will reside with them, and they will be his people.
00:03:29 “‘And God himself will be with them.
00:03:32 “‘And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes,
00:03:36 “‘and death will be no more,
00:03:38 “‘neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
00:03:43 The former things have passed away.’”
00:03:47 So according to this prophecy,
00:03:49 what can we look forward to?
00:03:52 Well, when we’re angels in heaven,
00:03:54 we won’t have any more pain or death.
00:03:58 It’s good that the question prompted
00:04:00 a response from the householder.
00:04:02 However, how can the publisher
00:04:05 use questions to lead the householder
00:04:07 to the correct understanding of these verses?
00:04:10 Let’s watch.
00:04:13 Yes, God is going to end pain and death.
00:04:17 But where will this take place?
00:04:19 The verse says that pain and death “will be no more.”
00:04:24 Where do pain and death exist today?
00:04:26 In heaven or on earth?
00:04:30 Rather than simply correcting the wrong thought,
00:04:33 the publisher used questions to help the householder reason
00:04:37 on the Scriptures and come to the right conclusion.
00:04:41 Good teaching involves more than just relating information.
00:04:46 As we use tactful questions to maintain interest,
00:04:50 to reason with our listeners,
00:04:52 and to emphasize important points,
00:04:55 we imitate the Grand Instructor, Jehovah God,
00:04:59 and the Great Teacher, Jesus Christ.

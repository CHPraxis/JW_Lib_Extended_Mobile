00:01.772 --> 00:04.609
Jehovah highly esteems the courage 


00:04.608 --> 00:07.026
of his loyal worshippers. 


00:07.027 --> 00:09.864
True courage, however, is shown by action, 


00:09.863 --> 00:12.533
as is the case with other good qualities. 


00:12.533 --> 00:17.036
For instance, “faith without works is dead.” 


00:17.037 --> 00:21.250
Likewise, love must be expressed, 
not merely in words but, 


00:21.250 --> 00:25.795
what does the Bible say, 
“in deed and truth.” 


00:25.795 --> 00:28.423
So it is with courage. 


00:28.423 --> 00:32.426
It takes trust in Jehovah 
to face distressing situations, 


00:32.427 --> 00:36.849
but our trust must also 
be accompanied by action. 


00:36.848 --> 00:40.560
Inaction, indecision, or sluggishness 


00:40.560 --> 00:44.105
may indicate a lack of courage. 


00:44.105 --> 00:46.358
Courage should impel us 


00:46.358 --> 00:49.361
to speak and act with boldness. 


00:49.362 --> 00:54.157
Jehovah, in turn, will bless our courage 
and help us to succeed. 


00:54.157 --> 00:58.454
This fact is well-illustrated 
by the Bible account of David. 


00:58.453 --> 01:00.788
When it came to doing Jehovah’s will, 


01:00.788 --> 01:03.708
David was a man of courage and of action. 


01:03.708 --> 01:07.461
Even after stumbling 
and suffering many calamities, 


01:07.462 --> 01:12.000
David remained loyal to Jehovah 
down to the end of his life. 


01:13.468 --> 01:15.470
Shortly before his death, 


01:15.470 --> 01:18.140
David formally entrusted his son Solomon 


01:18.140 --> 01:20.767
with the construction of Jehovah’s temple. 


01:20.767 --> 01:25.189
Imagine how Solomon must have felt 
when David handed him 


01:25.188 --> 01:29.526
architectural plans inspired 
by Jehovah himself! 


01:29.527 --> 01:33.947
Evidently, Solomon felt 
overwhelmed by the task. 


01:33.947 --> 01:37.785
But his father, David, 
strengthened him with words 


01:37.785 --> 01:41.497
that can strengthen us today 
when we face challenges. 


01:41.497 --> 01:43.499
We invite all of you, 


01:43.498 --> 01:45.916
including you children and young folks, 


01:45.917 --> 01:48.295
to open your Bible and read along 


01:48.295 --> 01:50.297
as we listen to the account recorded 


01:50.297 --> 01:55.344
at 1 Chronicles 28:1-20. 


01:55.343 --> 01:57.345
I’ll give you a moment. 


01:57.345 --> 02:01.558
That’s 1 Chronicles chapter 28, 


02:01.558 --> 02:04.000
beginning with verse 1. 


07:42.940 --> 07:45.777
Imagine Solomon’s task! 


07:45.777 --> 07:49.907
Not only had he been commissioned 
to build a unique house of true worship 


07:49.907 --> 07:54.704
but this temple was also 
to be ‘“exceedingly magnificent,” 


07:54.703 --> 07:57.998
with fame and beauty “known in all lands.”’


07:57.998 --> 08:02.626
Yet, Solomon had little, if any, 
experience as a builder. 


08:02.627 --> 08:06.674
David anticipated the challenges 
that lay ahead. 


08:06.673 --> 08:10.426
Further, Solomon would face personal attacks 


08:10.427 --> 08:13.764
from inside and outside his family. 


08:13.763 --> 08:16.098
David, therefore, admonished his son 


08:16.098 --> 08:19.518
to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah. 


08:19.518 --> 08:21.521
He also urged Solomon 


08:21.522 --> 08:26.000
to “be courageous and strong 
and to go to work.” 


08:27.485 --> 08:30.697
Fear could have paralyzed Solomon. 


08:30.697 --> 08:33.450
Thinking that his assignment 
was too difficult, 


08:33.450 --> 08:37.620
he might have procrastinated 
or even abandoned the task altogether. 


08:37.620 --> 08:41.833
This would have displeased Jehovah greatly. 


08:41.833 --> 08:44.795
Hence, David repeated the counsel: 


08:44.795 --> 08:47.505
“Go to work.” 


08:47.505 --> 08:50.258
David understood that courage and trust 


08:50.258 --> 08:53.178
in Jehovah must be accompanied by action. 


08:53.178 --> 08:56.890
He knew this from personal experience. 


08:56.890 --> 09:01.060
Let’s examine some events 
in David’s life that called for courage. 


09:01.060 --> 09:03.730
As we read these accounts, ask yourself, 


09:03.730 --> 09:06.442
‘Was David prone to procrastinate, 


09:06.442 --> 09:11.000
to hesitate, or to become paralyzed 
in the face of difficult problems?’ 


09:12.405 --> 09:14.532
Consider, for instance, the circumstances 


09:14.532 --> 09:17.744
surrounding David’s anointing 
as king of Israel. 


09:17.743 --> 09:19.913
King Saul was still reigning, 


09:19.913 --> 09:22.081
but Jehovah had rejected Saul 


09:22.082 --> 09:24.752
because of his flagrant disobedience. 


09:24.752 --> 09:27.545
Read along in your Bible 
as you listen to the words 


09:27.545 --> 09:32.550
of 1 Samuel 16:1-23. 


09:32.550 --> 09:39.000
That’s 1 Samuel 16:1-23. 


14:49.200 --> 14:53.328
In your mind’s eye, 
could you picture young David, his father, 


14:53.328 --> 14:57.375
and his brothers all standing 
before the prophet Samuel? 


14:57.375 --> 15:01.670
Then Jehovah handpicked David to be king 


15:01.670 --> 15:04.798
and directed Samuel to anoint the boy. 


15:04.798 --> 15:07.135
Yet, Saul remained on the throne, 


15:07.135 --> 15:11.807
still widely recognized 
as Israel’s legitimate king. 


15:11.807 --> 15:15.000
That was surely a time 
when David needed courage. 


15:16.102 --> 15:20.022
For one thing, how would Saul react 


15:20.022 --> 15:24.402
upon learning that David 
had been anointed as king? 


15:24.402 --> 15:27.322
Saul would certainly seek to kill him. 


15:27.322 --> 15:30.784
So imagine how David felt 


15:30.783 --> 15:34.245
when he was summoned to Saul’s house 


15:34.245 --> 15:37.248
to become his personal attendant! 


15:37.248 --> 15:41.168
He must have had misgivings, 
to say the least. 


15:41.168 --> 15:43.963
What about us today? 


15:43.963 --> 15:47.466
We may be feeling anxiety 
over family difficulties, 


15:47.467 --> 15:50.720
health problems, financial troubles, 


15:50.720 --> 15:55.392
persecution, or our own sinful inclinations. 


15:55.392 --> 15:59.479
But these problems needn’t scare us 
into spiritual paralysis. 


15:59.478 --> 16:03.273
When we face such challenges, 
we should seek Jehovah’s help 


16:03.273 --> 16:06.276
through prayer, his Word, 
and the congregation. 


16:06.277 --> 16:11.490
Often, we’ll find practical things we can do 
to minimize our problems. 


16:11.490 --> 16:13.618
Even when problems don’t go away, 


16:13.618 --> 16:16.078
we should stay busy working hard 


16:16.078 --> 16:18.498
to do Jehovah’s will as best we can, 


16:18.498 --> 16:21.375
even in the face of calamity. 


16:21.375 --> 16:24.503
That is true courage! 


16:24.503 --> 16:29.508
When David was called to appear before Saul, 
he didn’t succumb to fear. 


16:29.508 --> 16:33.303
He showed strength and courage, 
and he went to work! 


16:33.303 --> 16:35.306
He accepted the assignment, 


16:35.307 --> 16:38.392
knowing that Jehovah 
would give him practical wisdom 


16:38.392 --> 16:40.895
to act according to the need. 


16:40.895 --> 16:45.525
As it turned out, King Saul grew 
to love David very much, 


16:45.525 --> 16:48.862
and David became Saul’s armor-bearer. 


16:48.862 --> 16:51.447
Please follow the dramatic reading 


16:51.447 --> 16:56.452
of 1 Samuel 17:1-51. 


16:56.452 --> 16:58.664
That’s just one chapter over


16:58.663 --> 17:01.665
—1 Samuel chapter 17, 


17:01.665 --> 17:03.668
beginning with verse 1. 


17:03.668 --> 17:08.590
This is the exciting story 
of David and Goliath. 


17:08.590 --> 17:13.000
The account illustrates how David 
used practical wisdom and showed courage.


27:45.392 --> 27:49.689
The account of David and Goliath 
is a lesson about courage. 


27:49.688 --> 27:54.000
But it’s also a lesson 
about practical wisdom and faith in action. 


27:55.443 --> 27:58.071
David was working when his father told him 


27:58.072 --> 28:01.200
to take provisions to his brothers 
at the battlefront. 


28:01.200 --> 28:04.745
So David was expected 
to do two things at one time. 


28:04.745 --> 28:07.623
How could he take care of his family’s flock 


28:07.623 --> 28:10.208
and at the same time 
deliver goods to his brothers 


28:10.208 --> 28:12.293
several miles away? 


28:12.293 --> 28:15.005
He showed practical wisdom. 


28:15.005 --> 28:18.758
He also showed he was a trustworthy person. 


28:18.758 --> 28:20.760
The Bible says: 


28:20.760 --> 28:23.097
“David got up early in the morning 


28:23.097 --> 28:25.724
“and left someone in charge of the sheep; 


28:25.723 --> 28:28.393
“then he packed up and went 


28:28.393 --> 28:31.000
just as Jesse had commanded him.” 


28:32.397 --> 28:37.402
Soon he faced 
a potentially paralyzing situation. 


28:37.402 --> 28:39.989
David went looking for his brothers, 


28:39.988 --> 28:42.825
only to find Israel’s army terrified 


28:42.825 --> 28:47.537
by Goliath’s menacing posture 
and demoralized by his taunts. 


28:47.537 --> 28:51.167
David’s immediate response 
showed his courage. 


28:51.167 --> 28:55.379
He asked why no one 
had yet struck down 


28:55.378 --> 28:57.590
the presumptuous man 
who dared to taunt Jehovah. 


28:57.590 --> 29:01.885
Yet, David’s own brother, Eliab, 
berated him in public, 


29:01.885 --> 29:05.013
questioned his motives, 
called him presumptuous, 


29:05.013 --> 29:08.891
and accused him of neglecting 
his father’s flocks. 


29:08.892 --> 29:13.897
Nevertheless, David volunteered 
to fight Goliath, 


29:13.897 --> 29:16.942
only to get brushed off by the king. 


29:16.942 --> 29:20.195
Saul told him that he 
couldn’t possibly defeat Goliath 


29:20.195 --> 29:23.000
because David was just “a boy”! 


29:24.533 --> 29:26.535
What did David do 


29:26.535 --> 29:29.747
in the face of such 
disheartening circumstances? 


29:29.747 --> 29:32.332
He showed courage. 


29:32.332 --> 29:35.127
That courage gave him the spiritual 


29:35.127 --> 29:38.380
and emotional strength to go to work. 


29:38.380 --> 29:42.217
He remembered what Jehovah 
had done for him in the past. 


29:42.217 --> 29:45.595
David never forgot 
how Jehovah rescued him 


29:45.595 --> 29:47.807
from a bear and a lion 


29:47.807 --> 29:51.852
—both of which are superior 
to humans in speed and strength. 


29:51.852 --> 29:54.730
Jehovah not only rescued David 


29:54.730 --> 29:58.317
but he also enabled him 
to kill those ferocious beasts. 


29:58.317 --> 30:00.902
So David could confidently say: 


30:00.902 --> 30:05.574
“Jehovah, who rescued me 
from the claws of the lion and the bear, 


30:05.573 --> 30:09.828
he is the one who will rescue me 
from the hand of this Philistine.”


30:09.828 --> 30:13.873
When we face discouragement 
or even depression, 


30:13.873 --> 30:16.460
could we benefit from meditating on the ways 


30:16.460 --> 30:18.712
Jehovah has already rescued us 


30:18.712 --> 30:22.382
from seemingly insurmountable problems? 


30:22.382 --> 30:27.012
David was courageous and went to work. 


30:27.012 --> 30:30.515
He made practical decisions 
with good results. 


30:30.515 --> 30:33.643
For example, 
when Saul offered David 


30:33.643 --> 30:37.646
his own heavy battle gear, 
David gave it a try. 


30:37.647 --> 30:41.735
But he soon realized 
that a copper helmet, a coat of mail, 


30:41.735 --> 30:45.530
and a sword strapped over his garment 
would only get in his way. 


30:45.530 --> 30:48.617
So, what did he do? 


30:48.617 --> 30:50.035
In effect, 


30:50.035 --> 30:52.453
he simplified! 


30:52.453 --> 30:55.165
He got rid of the burden. 


30:55.165 --> 30:57.167
What about us? 


30:57.167 --> 31:00.170
Over the years, 
we might have cluttered our lives 


31:00.170 --> 31:04.215
with nonessential possessions 
or unnecessary activities. 


31:04.215 --> 31:07.720
These things can smother our spirituality. 


31:07.720 --> 31:11.265
If that’s true of you, why not go to work? 


31:11.265 --> 31:14.183
Take inventory 
of your possessions and habits, 


31:14.183 --> 31:16.520
and eliminate what’s cumbersome. 


31:16.520 --> 31:19.815
By simplifying our life, 
we can make it easier 


31:19.815 --> 31:23.000
to keep our eye focused 
on serving Jehovah. 


31:24.068 --> 31:27.740
Like all of us, David wasn’t perfect. 


31:27.740 --> 31:30.783
But his courageous and decisive actions 


31:30.783 --> 31:33.828
made him Jehovah’s dear friend. 


31:33.828 --> 31:37.456
Thus, at the end of his faithful course, 


31:37.457 --> 31:41.754
David could with total freeness 
of speech tell his son: 


31:41.753 --> 31:44.631
“Be courageous and strong 


31:44.632 --> 31:53.745
and go to work”!

00:01 Jehovah highly esteems the courage
00:04 of his loyal worshippers.
00:07 True courage, however, is shown by action,
00:09 as is the case with other good qualities.
00:12 For instance, “faith without works is dead.”
00:17 Likewise, love must be expressed,  not merely in words but,
00:21 what does the Bible say,  “in deed and truth.”
00:25 So it is with courage.
00:28 It takes trust in Jehovah  to face distressing situations,
00:32 but our trust must also  be accompanied by action.
00:36 Inaction, indecision, or sluggishness
00:40 may indicate a lack of courage.
00:44 Courage should impel us
00:46 to speak and act with boldness.
00:49 Jehovah, in turn, will bless our courage  and help us to succeed.
00:54 This fact is well-illustrated  by the Bible account of David.
00:58 When it came to doing Jehovah’s will,
01:00 David was a man of courage and of action.
01:03 Even after stumbling  and suffering many calamities,
01:07 David remained loyal to Jehovah  down to the end of his life.
01:13 Shortly before his death,
01:15 David formally entrusted his son Solomon
01:18 with the construction of Jehovah’s temple.
01:20 Imagine how Solomon must have felt  when David handed him
01:25 architectural plans inspired  by Jehovah himself!
01:29 Evidently, Solomon felt  overwhelmed by the task.
01:33 But his father, David,  strengthened him with words
01:37 that can strengthen us today  when we face challenges.
01:41 We invite all of you,
01:43 including you children and young folks,
01:45 to open your Bible and read along
01:48 as we listen to the account recorded
01:50 at 1 Chronicles 28:1-20.
01:55 I’ll give you a moment.
01:57 That’s 1 Chronicles chapter 28,
02:01 beginning with verse 1.
07:42 Imagine Solomon’s task!
07:45 Not only had he been commissioned  to build a unique house of true worship
07:49 but this temple was also  to be ‘“exceedingly magnificent,”
07:54 with fame and beauty “known in all lands.”’
07:57 Yet, Solomon had little, if any,  experience as a builder.
08:02 David anticipated the challenges  that lay ahead.
08:06 Further, Solomon would face personal attacks
08:10 from inside and outside his family.
08:13 David, therefore, admonished his son
08:16 to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah.
08:19 He also urged Solomon
08:21 to “be courageous and strong  and to go to work.”
08:27 Fear could have paralyzed Solomon.
08:30 Thinking that his assignment  was too difficult,
08:33 he might have procrastinated  or even abandoned the task altogether.
08:37 This would have displeased Jehovah greatly.
08:41 Hence, David repeated the counsel:
08:44 “Go to work.”
08:47 David understood that courage and trust
08:50 in Jehovah must be accompanied by action.
08:53 He knew this from personal experience.
08:56 Let’s examine some events  in David’s life that called for courage.
09:01 As we read these accounts, ask yourself,
09:03 ‘Was David prone to procrastinate,
09:06 to hesitate, or to become paralyzed  in the face of difficult problems?’
09:12 Consider, for instance, the circumstances
09:14 surrounding David’s anointing  as king of Israel.
09:17 King Saul was still reigning,
09:19 but Jehovah had rejected Saul
09:22 because of his flagrant disobedience.
09:24 Read along in your Bible  as you listen to the words
09:27 of 1 Samuel 16:1-23.
09:32 That’s 1 Samuel 16:1-23.
14:49 In your mind’s eye,  could you picture young David, his father,
14:53 and his brothers all standing  before the prophet Samuel?
14:57 Then Jehovah handpicked David to be king
15:01 and directed Samuel to anoint the boy.
15:04 Yet, Saul remained on the throne,
15:07 still widely recognized  as Israel’s legitimate king.
15:11 That was surely a time  when David needed courage.
15:16 For one thing, how would Saul react
15:20 upon learning that David  had been anointed as king?
15:24 Saul would certainly seek to kill him.
15:27 So imagine how David felt
15:30 when he was summoned to Saul’s house
15:34 to become his personal attendant!
15:37 He must have had misgivings,  to say the least.
15:41 What about us today?
15:43 We may be feeling anxiety  over family difficulties,
15:47 health problems, financial troubles,
15:50 persecution, or our own sinful inclinations.
15:55 But these problems needn’t scare us  into spiritual paralysis.
15:59 When we face such challenges,  we should seek Jehovah’s help
16:03 through prayer, his Word,  and the congregation.
16:06 Often, we’ll find practical things we can do  to minimize our problems.
16:11 Even when problems don’t go away,
16:13 we should stay busy working hard
16:16 to do Jehovah’s will as best we can,
16:18 even in the face of calamity.
16:21 That is true courage!
16:24 When David was called to appear before Saul,  he didn’t succumb to fear.
16:29 He showed strength and courage,  and he went to work!
16:33 He accepted the assignment,
16:35 knowing that Jehovah  would give him practical wisdom
16:38 to act according to the need.
16:40 As it turned out, King Saul grew  to love David very much,
16:45 and David became Saul’s armor-bearer.
16:48 Please follow the dramatic reading
16:51 of 1 Samuel 17:1-51.
16:56 That’s just one chapter over
16:58 —1 Samuel chapter 17,
17:01 beginning with verse 1.
17:03 This is the exciting story  of David and Goliath.
17:08 The account illustrates how David  used practical wisdom and showed courage.
27:45 The account of David and Goliath  is a lesson about courage.
27:49 But it’s also a lesson  about practical wisdom and faith in action.
27:55 David was working when his father told him
27:58 to take provisions to his brothers  at the battlefront.
28:01 So David was expected  to do two things at one time.
28:04 How could he take care of his family’s flock
28:07 and at the same time  deliver goods to his brothers
28:10 several miles away?
28:12 He showed practical wisdom.
28:15 He also showed he was a trustworthy person.
28:18 The Bible says:
28:20 “David got up early in the morning
28:23 “and left someone in charge of the sheep;
28:25 “then he packed up and went
28:28 just as Jesse had commanded him.”
28:32 Soon he faced  a potentially paralyzing situation.
28:37 David went looking for his brothers,
28:39 only to find Israel’s army terrified
28:42 by Goliath’s menacing posture  and demoralized by his taunts.
28:47 David’s immediate response  showed his courage.
28:51 He asked why no one  had yet struck down
28:55 the presumptuous man  who dared to taunt Jehovah.
28:57 Yet, David’s own brother, Eliab,  berated him in public,
29:01 questioned his motives,  called him presumptuous,
29:05 and accused him of neglecting  his father’s flocks.
29:08 Nevertheless, David volunteered  to fight Goliath,
29:13 only to get brushed off by the king.
29:16 Saul told him that he  couldn’t possibly defeat Goliath
29:20 because David was just “a boy”!
29:24 What did David do
29:26 in the face of such  disheartening circumstances?
29:29 He showed courage.
29:32 That courage gave him the spiritual
29:35 and emotional strength to go to work.
29:38 He remembered what Jehovah  had done for him in the past.
29:42 David never forgot  how Jehovah rescued him
29:45 from a bear and a lion
29:47 —both of which are superior  to humans in speed and strength.
29:51 Jehovah not only rescued David
29:54 but he also enabled him  to kill those ferocious beasts.
29:58 So David could confidently say:
30:00 “Jehovah, who rescued me  from the claws of the lion and the bear,
30:05 he is the one who will rescue me  from the hand of this Philistine.”
30:09 When we face discouragement  or even depression,
30:13 could we benefit from meditating on the ways
30:16 Jehovah has already rescued us
30:18 from seemingly insurmountable problems?
30:22 David was courageous and went to work.
30:27 He made practical decisions  with good results.
30:30 For example,  when Saul offered David
30:33 his own heavy battle gear,  David gave it a try.
30:37 But he soon realized  that a copper helmet, a coat of mail,
30:41 and a sword strapped over his garment  would only get in his way.
30:45 So, what did he do?
30:48 In effect,
30:50 he simplified!
30:52 He got rid of the burden.
30:55 What about us?
30:57 Over the years,  we might have cluttered our lives
31:00 with nonessential possessions  or unnecessary activities.
31:04 These things can smother our spirituality.
31:07 If that’s true of you, why not go to work?
31:11 Take inventory  of your possessions and habits,
31:14 and eliminate what’s cumbersome.
31:16 By simplifying our life,  we can make it easier
31:19 to keep our eye focused  on serving Jehovah.
31:24 Like all of us, David wasn’t perfect.
31:27 But his courageous and decisive actions
31:30 made him Jehovah’s dear friend.
31:33 Thus, at the end of his faithful course,
31:37 David could with total freeness  of speech tell his son:
31:41 “Be courageous and strong
31:44 and go to work”!

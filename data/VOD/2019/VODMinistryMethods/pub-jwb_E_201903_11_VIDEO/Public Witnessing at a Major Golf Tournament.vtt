The city is hosting a golf championship,

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are so excited to reach out
to all of these international visitors.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the first time in Charlotte

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had such a major sporting event.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People would be coming
from some 60 countries.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A total of some 200,000 were expected.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when the branch contacted us

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said this was
a special public witnessing initiative,

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:35.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we knew that we wanted to do our very best
to reach as many of those people as possible.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was about advertising
jw.org®, Jehovah, and the Kingdom.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were looking 
at what would give the greatest visibility

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the cart and our effort.

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch office was very, very supportive.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave us good direction,
they put us in touch with brothers

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been involved in organizing
a public witnessing initiative

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for another large sports event,
and they provided us

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with so much insight from their experience.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the first time
that some 5 circuits,

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:12.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
75 congregations, and multiple language groups

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got a chance to work on one project together.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ended up with 48 locations

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:23.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some 1,400 publishers
trained to man these locations.

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were running shifts from six o’clock 
in the morning until eight o’clock at night.

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:34.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Organization and scheduling was the key,
and they did it beautifully.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With public witnessing,

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
individuals often come to us

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they see our smiling faces.

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to maintain a friendly disposition
—a happy one.

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:55.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always try to make
eye contact, and if it’s morning,

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we greet them with a “Good morning.”

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister said
that she “smiled” people over to the cart,

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s really what a smile can do.

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re looking for something
to make them happy

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to enjoy life—
and you represent that just by smiling.

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they see a topic 
that catches their attention,

00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
internally, they’re asking
themselves these questions.

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they really want to find
the answers, they’ll come over.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see as cars pass by

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re taking note of our presence,

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a witness in itself.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had individuals stop their cars

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wave us over to bring the literature to them.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might just turn briefly,
but they’ll see the cart; they’ll see jw.org®.

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We talked to people from all over the world.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man came by;
he was from the southern part of Ukraine.

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to know, “What is this all about?”

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I explained the Bible educational work.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:04.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained how, at the website,
he can read literature online in his language.

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was quite impressed.

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he brought his friend over,
who was visiting from Kazakhstan,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Russian explained what the cart 
was all about and what we were doing there.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work has had a really invigorating effect.

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:27.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister said, “Now I no longer think
simply in terms of literature placement;

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:31.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think in terms of looks and smiles.”

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:34.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s identified brothers and sisters
who are now excited

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:36.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about doing public witnessing.

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:41.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are getting an opportunity
through public witnessing to reach people

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who we hadn’t reached any other way.

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:45.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to talk 
to so many people about our website

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who otherwise would have never known about it.

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really that life-saving message

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re getting the opportunity to see,

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:55.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps for the first time,
when they see these public witnessing carts.

00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it was all said and done,

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was an outstanding success.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This public witnessing campaign

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had such a positive effect upon the community.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through this special effort,
we were able to show

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true hospitality to these visitors
from all over the world.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:17.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the excitement
and seeing the productivity of this work,

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:21.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many were commenting,
“Hey, when are we going to do this again?”

00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The final result was a witness beyond anything

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:29.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could have imagined at the very outset.

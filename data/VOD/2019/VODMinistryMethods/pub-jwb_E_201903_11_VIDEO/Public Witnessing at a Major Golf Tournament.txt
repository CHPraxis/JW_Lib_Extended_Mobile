00:00:03 The city is hosting a golf championship,
00:00:06 and we are so excited to reach out to all of these international visitors.
00:00:13 This was the first time in Charlotte
00:00:16 that we had such a major sporting event.
00:00:19 People would be coming from some 60 countries.
00:00:23 A total of some 200,000 were expected.
00:00:26 And so when the branch contacted us
00:00:28 and said this was a special public witnessing initiative,
00:00:32 we knew that we wanted to do our very best to reach as many of those people as possible.
00:00:37 It was about advertising jw.org®, Jehovah, and the Kingdom.
00:00:42 And so we were looking  at what would give the greatest visibility
00:00:45 to the cart and our effort.
00:00:49 The branch office was very, very supportive.
00:00:52 They gave us good direction, they put us in touch with brothers
00:00:55 that had been involved in organizing a public witnessing initiative
00:00:59 for another large sports event, and they provided us
00:01:02 with so much insight from their experience.
00:01:05 This was the first time that some 5 circuits,
00:01:09 75 congregations, and multiple language groups
00:01:12 got a chance to work on one project together.
00:01:16 We ended up with 48 locations
00:01:19 and some 1,400 publishers trained to man these locations.
00:01:24 We were running shifts from six o’clock  in the morning until eight o’clock at night.
00:01:30 Organization and scheduling was the key, and they did it beautifully.
00:01:39 With public witnessing,
00:01:41 individuals often come to us
00:01:44 because they see our smiling faces.
00:01:47 We try to maintain a friendly disposition —a happy one.
00:01:51 We always try to make eye contact, and if it’s morning,
00:01:55 we greet them with a “Good morning.”
00:01:58 One sister said that she “smiled” people over to the cart,
00:02:02 and that’s really what a smile can do.
00:02:04 They’re looking for something to make them happy
00:02:07 —to enjoy life— and you represent that just by smiling.
00:02:12 When they see a topic  that catches their attention,
00:02:15 internally, they’re asking themselves these questions.
00:02:18 If they really want to find the answers, they’ll come over.
00:02:23 You can see as cars pass by
00:02:25 that they’re taking note of our presence,
00:02:28 and it’s a witness in itself.
00:02:31 We’ve had individuals stop their cars
00:02:34 and wave us over to bring the literature to them.
00:02:38 They might just turn briefly, but they’ll see the cart; they’ll see jw.org®.
00:02:46 We talked to people from all over the world.
00:02:49 A man came by; he was from the southern part of Ukraine.
00:02:54 He wanted to know, “What is this all about?”
00:02:56 So I explained the Bible educational work.
00:02:59 I explained how, at the website, he can read literature online in his language.
00:03:04 He was quite impressed.
00:03:06 And then he brought his friend over, who was visiting from Kazakhstan,
00:03:09 and in Russian explained what the cart  was all about and what we were doing there.
00:03:18 This work has had a really invigorating effect.
00:03:22 One sister said, “Now I no longer think simply in terms of literature placement;
00:03:27 I think in terms of looks and smiles.”
00:03:31 It’s identified brothers and sisters who are now excited
00:03:34 about doing public witnessing.
00:03:36 We are getting an opportunity through public witnessing to reach people
00:03:41 who we hadn’t reached any other way.
00:03:43 We got to talk  to so many people about our website
00:03:45 who otherwise would have never known about it.
00:03:47 It’s really that life-saving message
00:03:49 that they’re getting the opportunity to see,
00:03:51 perhaps for the first time, when they see these public witnessing carts.
00:03:56 When it was all said and done,
00:03:58 this was an outstanding success.
00:04:00 This public witnessing campaign
00:04:03 had such a positive effect upon the community.
00:04:06 Through this special effort, we were able to show
00:04:08 true hospitality to these visitors from all over the world.
00:04:12 After the excitement and seeing the productivity of this work,
00:04:17 many were commenting, “Hey, when are we going to do this again?”
00:04:21 The final result was a witness beyond anything
00:04:25 we could have imagined at the very outset.

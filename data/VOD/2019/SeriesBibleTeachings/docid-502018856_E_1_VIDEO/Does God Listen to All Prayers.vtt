The Bible describes God

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as the “Hearer of prayer.”

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can even hear your silent prayers.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that possible?

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Hearer of prayer
is also the Creator of all life.

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He understands how the human mind works.

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He designed it.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:34.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he can read the thoughts of your mind

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear your silent prayers.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God is interested in you

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:48.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter where you live.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever language you speak,
he understands it.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does he accept
and listen to <i>all</i>  prayers?

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a manager
who sees an employee stealing.

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The manager confronts him,

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the employee first lies
about his stealing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then tries to justify his actions.

00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the manager hears
the employee’s lies and excuses,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he refuses to accept them.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, God does not accept all prayers.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what if a person’s prayer is selfish?

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.127 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What if a man mistreats his wife at home,

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:51.298 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the next day he asks for God’s blessings?

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:55.844 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What if soldiers pray to God for help

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:57.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to destroy their enemy,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.306 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
while the opposing army

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.767 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
prays for the same thing?

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will God accept such prayers?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, God is not pleased with prayers

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that conflict with his moral principles.

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:16.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
God eagerly accepts your prayers,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if you have done bad things,

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you sincerely want to draw close to him

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seek his wisdom and forgiveness.

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:32.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being heard by God is indeed possible

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who strive to please him.

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God really hear your prayers?

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can prayers do for you?

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

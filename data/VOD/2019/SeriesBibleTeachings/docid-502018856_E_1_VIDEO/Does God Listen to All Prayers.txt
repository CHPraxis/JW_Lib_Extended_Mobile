00:00:06 The Bible describes God
00:00:08 as the “Hearer of prayer.”
00:00:13 He can even hear your silent prayers.
00:00:17 How is that possible?
00:00:20 The Hearer of prayer is also the Creator of all life.
00:00:25 He understands how the human mind works.
00:00:29 He designed it.
00:00:30 So he can read the thoughts of your mind
00:00:34 and hear your silent prayers.
00:00:41 Jehovah God is interested in you
00:00:46 no matter where you live.
00:00:49 Whatever language you speak, he understands it.
00:00:55 But does he accept and listen to all  prayers?
00:01:07 Imagine a manager who sees an employee stealing.
00:01:15 The manager confronts him,
00:01:17 but the employee first lies about his stealing
00:01:19 and then tries to justify his actions.
00:01:23 Although the manager hears the employee’s lies and excuses,
00:01:27 he refuses to accept them.
00:01:30 Similarly, God does not accept all prayers.
00:01:35 For example,
00:01:37 what if a person’s prayer is selfish?
00:01:44 What if a man mistreats his wife at home,
00:01:47 and the next day he asks for God’s blessings?
00:01:53 What if soldiers pray to God for help
00:01:55 to destroy their enemy,
00:01:57 while the opposing army
00:01:59 prays for the same thing?
00:02:01 Will God accept such prayers?
00:02:05 Clearly, God is not pleased with prayers
00:02:08 that conflict with his moral principles.
00:02:12 On the other hand, God eagerly accepts your prayers,
00:02:16 even if you have done bad things,
00:02:19 if you sincerely want to draw close to him
00:02:22 and seek his wisdom and forgiveness.
00:02:28 Being heard by God is indeed possible
00:02:32 for those who strive to please him.
00:02:37 Does God really hear your prayers?
00:02:41 What can prayers do for you?

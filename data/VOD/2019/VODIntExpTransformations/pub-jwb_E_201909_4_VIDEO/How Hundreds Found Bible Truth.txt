00:00:07 In the mid-1970’s, several brothers from the Montréal area
00:00:11 were approached to help with a unique situation that was unfolding.
00:00:15 A special pioneer, who was taking the lead at the time,
00:00:18 said that about a thousand people —all from the same church—
00:00:22 wanted to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:25 And it was all because of an informal witness.
00:00:30 The story began this way:
00:00:33 A brother in the local congregation
00:00:36 approached me one day
00:00:37 to tell me about an experience
00:00:38 he had with one of his workmates.
00:00:41 This man was responsible for a small local church,
00:00:44 and the brother had been able to give him an informal witness.
00:00:47 The man indicated
00:00:49 that he would like a Bible study,
00:00:51 and he wanted to convince the other members of his church
00:00:54 to also study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:59 The fact was that this person
00:01:01 had a certain influence in the church.
00:01:04 So he talked to the church members
00:01:06 about the message he had heard from the brother,
00:01:09 and he convinced them that what they were missing
00:01:12 was a better understanding of the Bible.
00:01:14 Many people heard about it
00:01:16 because it was an exceptional event.
00:01:19 From what I heard, there were around a thousand people
00:01:22 who wanted to study the Bible at that time.
00:01:25 We didn’t have the brothers and sisters
00:01:27 that were needed to conduct all these Bible studies.
00:01:30 So they formed groups of 10, 12, 15 people.
00:01:34 And once or twice a week in Kingdom Halls, they conducted Bible studies.
00:01:38 It was questions, questions.
00:01:41 Everyone was asking questions.
00:01:47 But the Bible could always answer all these questions in a logical way
00:01:51 —one verse would explain another.
00:01:54 And we came to see
00:01:55 that the Bible in its entirety could explain every subject.
00:01:59 At the beginning,
00:02:01 groups of two or three families studied together.
00:02:06 And, yeah, they answered with the Bible.
00:02:08 That amazed me because
00:02:11 I didn’t know the Bible at all.
00:02:12 But I thought, ‘The Bible talks about this;
00:02:15 the Bible talks about that.’
00:02:16 It was like a discovery for me.
00:02:19 That was the parents.
00:02:21 The children weren’t there.
00:02:22 So when we accepted it, then we’d teach it to our children.
00:02:28 Everyone was disciplined while sitting at the table.
00:02:32 The children were very quiet
00:02:34 with their Truth book in front of them and their Bible.
00:02:37 When these families came to the Kingdom Hall,
00:02:39 the children were sitting beside their parents,
00:02:42 not moving, paying attention to what was being said.
00:02:45 I was young when they started coming.
00:02:47 I remember it very well.
00:02:49 A lot of them were my age.
00:02:51 I saw them like future potential friends.
00:02:55 It was really touching.
00:02:58 The first meeting I attended was here in Laval.
00:03:03 It really contributed to me one day taking a stand
00:03:08 and Jehovah becoming my God
00:03:11 and the truth becoming my way of life.
00:03:17 When I was young,
00:03:20 I was very afraid of death.
00:03:22 It was such a relief to learn that we don’t suffer when we die.
00:03:27 It’s like a sleep.
00:03:30 The ambitions I had before,
00:03:32 that may have been attainable,
00:03:34 became second place.
00:03:37 Now it was to have a simple life,
00:03:39 to walk with the organization,
00:03:41 and to raise my children in the truth.
00:03:44 Today, these brothers are really doing a lot in the organization,
00:03:48 helping in different areas, shouldering great responsibilities.
00:03:52 My father always strived
00:03:54 to set the example for all his children,
00:03:57 and it made an impression on me.
00:03:59 Now my wife and I have the privilege of serving here at the Canada branch.
00:04:02 I was eight years old
00:04:04 when my family started attending meetings.
00:04:06 I have really good memories of how
00:04:09 the local congregation at the time
00:04:11 took care of us and looked after us.
00:04:13 At the age of 15,
00:04:15 I started reading my Bible every day and studying it too.
00:04:18 From that point on,
00:04:20 I knew what I wanted to do with my life
00:04:22 —serve Jehovah full-time.
00:04:28 I really think Jehovah could see us on the inside.
00:04:36 Jehovah helped us a lot.
00:04:39 You can’t have anything better than that.
00:04:47 On our own, we never would have got out of that situation.
00:04:53 But Jehovah found a way to find “rightly disposed” ones.
00:04:57 A simple informal witness led to Bible studies that touched so many.

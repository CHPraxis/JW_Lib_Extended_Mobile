In the mid-1970’s,
several brothers from the Montréal area

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were approached to help
with a unique situation that was unfolding.

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A special pioneer,
who was taking the lead at the time,

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said that about a thousand people
—all from the same church—

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to study the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was all because of an informal witness.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story began this way:

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.432 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A brother in the local congregation

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
approached me one day

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:38.934 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to tell me about an experience

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.186 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he had with one of his workmates.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was responsible
for a small local church,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brother had been able
to give him an informal witness.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man indicated

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would like a Bible study,

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted to convince
the other members of his church

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to also study the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.624 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The fact was that this person

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.335 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had a certain influence in the church.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:06.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So he talked to the church members

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the message
he had heard from the brother,

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he convinced them
that what they were missing

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a better understanding of the Bible.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.847 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many people heard about it

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because it was an exceptional event.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From what I heard,
there were around a thousand people

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to study
the Bible at that time.

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have
the brothers and sisters

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were needed
to conduct all these Bible studies.

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they formed groups
of 10, 12, 15 people.

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:38.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once or twice a week in Kingdom Halls,
they conducted Bible studies.

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:41.830 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was questions, questions.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.291 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was asking questions.

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible could always answer
all these questions in a logical way

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one verse would explain another.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:55.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we came to see

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible in its entirety
could explain every subject.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.183 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning,

00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:05.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
groups of two or three families studied together.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, yeah,
they answered with the Bible.

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That amazed me because

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.820 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know the Bible at all.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I thought, ‘The Bible talks about this;

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:16.490 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible talks about that.’

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like a discovery for me.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the parents.

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The children weren’t there.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:26.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we accepted it,
then we’d teach it to our children.

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:32.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was disciplined while sitting at the table.

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The children were very quiet

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their Truth book
in front of them and their Bible.

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When these families
came to the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the children were sitting beside their parents,

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not moving, paying attention
to what was being said.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.938 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was young when they started coming.

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:49.732 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I remember it very well.

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:51.734 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A lot of them were my age.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them like future potential friends.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really touching.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first meeting
I attended was here in Laval.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really contributed to me
one day taking a stand

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah becoming my God

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the truth becoming my way of life.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.387 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was young,

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was very afraid of death.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a relief to learn
that we don’t suffer when we die.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like a sleep.

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:32.608 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The ambitions I had before,

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:34.610 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that may have been attainable,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.196 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became second place.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it was to have a simple life,

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:41.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk with the organization,

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to raise my children in the truth.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, these brothers
are really doing a lot in the organization,

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:52.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping in different areas,
shouldering great responsibilities.

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:54.588 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My father always strived

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:57.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to set the example for all his children,

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it made an impression on me.

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now my wife and I have the privilege
of serving here at the Canada branch.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.723 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was eight years old

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.934 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when my family started attending meetings.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have really good memories of how

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:11.396 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the local congregation at the time

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.107 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
took care of us and looked after us.

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the age of 15,

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started reading my Bible every day
and studying it too.

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that point on,

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew what I wanted to do with my life

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—serve Jehovah full-time.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really think Jehovah could see us on the inside.

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us a lot.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t have anything better than that.

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On our own,
we never would have got out of that situation.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah found a way
to find “rightly disposed” ones.

00:04:57.109 --> 00:05:02.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A simple informal witness
led to Bible studies that touched so many.

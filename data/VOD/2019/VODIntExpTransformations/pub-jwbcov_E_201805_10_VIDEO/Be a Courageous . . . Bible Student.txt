00:00:04 In 1998, I started dating a girl, and we dated for two years.
00:00:08 During that time, I also started studying the Bible.
00:00:11 Our relationship was going well.
00:00:13 We didn’t have any big issues; we got along well; we rarely argued.
00:00:17 So, then, how do you go to someone when you’re dating
00:00:20 and everything is going well and say:
00:00:22 “Listen, I can see you don’t feel the same as I do.
00:00:25 “I don’t want to date you anymore because now I’m studying the Bible.
00:00:28 I want to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses”?
00:00:30 I really had to muster up a lot of courage
00:00:32 to tell her that.
00:00:34 But there are moments when you start to ask yourself,
00:00:36 ‘Did I really make the right decision?’
00:00:38 And up to around the time when I got baptized,
00:00:41 I was still hoping that she would learn the truth.
00:00:43 But, unfortunately, that didn’t happen.
00:00:47 I was also involved in something else that I really loved, which was sports.
00:00:52 When I was younger, I was part of the track and field team,
00:00:55 and I participated in many local 5K and 10K competitions.
00:01:03 Some who trained with me at the time went on to become professional athletes.
00:01:08 Some even competed in the Olympics.
00:01:13 I knew I had a decision to make.
00:01:15 It wouldn’t be possible for me to keep training for track and field
00:01:19 while trying to serve Jehovah.
00:01:22 So I had to have enough courage to speak to my coach.
00:01:25 And after that, I gave up being an athlete.
00:01:30 Looking back now, it wasn’t easy to leave those things behind,
00:01:34 but what Jehovah has given me today
00:01:37 is much more valuable than anything I gave up.
00:01:40 I have the privilege of serving
00:01:42 in Bethel together with my wife, who also gives her all in Jehovah’s service.
00:01:46 I can honestly say that I am
00:01:49 truly happy serving Jehovah with all my heart.

Well, now we’re looking forward to hearing

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a graduate of the 41st class of Gilead,

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
Brother Gerrit Lösch.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lösch has just completed 25 years

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of service as a member of the Governing Body.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lösch will speak to us now
on the subject “Are You Ready?”

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready?

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Gilead students,
no doubt you have been asked

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that question many times this week.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Boy Scouts
have the greeting,

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Always Prepared.’

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they prepared for?

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re supposed to be ready, or prepared,

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for doing at least one good deed each day.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True Christians are also
supposed to be always prepared.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prepared for what?

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, for doing good deeds and also prepared

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the final return of the Lord Jesus

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a mighty heavenly King
in the great tribulation.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:21.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus began to rule
over his congregation, when?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure you understand,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Pentecost 33 of our Common Era,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over his congregation.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:36.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Insight </i>book says:
“The Scriptures show [and this is a quote]

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that from Pentecost 33 C.E. onward,

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a spiritual kingdom

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:47.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was set up over his disciples.”

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul reminded Christians of Colossae:

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:55.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He rescued us
from the authority of the darkness

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and transferred us into the kingdom

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his beloved Son.”—Colossians 1:13.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus has been ruling
as King over his disciples

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever since Pentecost 33 C.E.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always been
the head of the congregation,

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is compared to a body.

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he ruled as King
during the Middle Ages also.

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:26.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, something changed in 1914 C.E.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, from that time onward,

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus would rule also over his enemies,

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both in heaven and on earth.

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:39.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prophecy was fulfilled

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:43.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we find in Psalm 110.

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:48.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there it says in Psalm 110:

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah declared to my Lord:

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:59.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Sit at my right hand until I place

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your enemies as a stool for your feet.’

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will extend the scepter

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:08.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of your power out of Zion, saying:

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’”

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:16.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we understand that in 1914

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he returned as heavenly King to rule.

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:22.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since that time, many things are happening

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing us that he’s actually
‘ruling in the midst of his enemies.’

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:30.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not ruling only over his congregation.

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:34.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan and his agents were not able to prevent

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:38.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the appointment
of “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about Jesus’ final coming as Judge?

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will that return happen?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know exactly,
but Jesus predicted events

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:54.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from which we can conclude
when it would be close.

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Jesus said that we would not be able

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know in advance the exact time or date,

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he prophesied events that would occur

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from which we
could notice the nearness

00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his final coming as Judge.

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, many people
attempted to pinpoint his return.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By their expectations and predictions,

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:23.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they aroused curiosity,

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:27.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many times these predictions failed.

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:29.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in the first century,

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there already existed
among Christians

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
false expectations.

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:38.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Thessalonians, for instance, had such.

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul needed to write to them
for them to find balance.

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:48.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Thessalonians 2:1

00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
onward says:

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, brothers, concerning the presence

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:58.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of our Lord Jesus Christ
and our being gathered together to him,

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we ask you not to be quickly shaken

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from your reason nor to be alarmed

“either by an inspired statement
or by a spoken message

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:10.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or by a letter appearing to be from us,

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:15.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the effect
that the day of Jehovah is here.

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:19.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let no one lead you astray,”

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says in verse 3.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many other false expectations

00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:30.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the centuries that followed.

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martin of Tours, a French bishop,

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:39.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stated that the world
would end before the year 400.

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:42.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hippolytus and two others predicted Jesus

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to return in the year 500

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:48.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

(with his Latin name),

predicted it for the year 800.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:02.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, also the year 1000 was predicted,

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:05.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including by a pope, Pope Sylvester,

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as some sources claim.

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:13.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pope Innocent III predicted the end

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the year 1284,

Christ’s second coming
to take place that year in Strasbourg.

00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:57.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

saying that Jesus
had returned indeed,

but in invisible form.

00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:34.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

his return to be visible

but then understood
that it would be invisible.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also expected
the glorification of the “little flock”

for the spring of 1918.

Will special prophecies
be fulfilled a hundred years after 1919?

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:32.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is just a question.

00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No answer.

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:38.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were serious testings

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the year 1925 also.

00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:47.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for that year,
our brothers had great expectations.

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:19.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of faithful men of old expected in 1925

“Nevertheless, there is no reason for us

“to make a closer examination

“of the Scriptures
regarding this matter of a day of judgment.

“In doing so, we find
that the important thing is not the date.

“What is important
is our keeping ever in mind

00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that <i>there is such a day</i>

00:15:45.965 --> 00:15:48.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—and it is getting closer
and it will require

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:51.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an accounting on the part of all of us.

00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:53.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Peter said that Christians

00:15:53.097 --> 00:15:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“should rightly be
‘awaiting and keeping close in mind

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:59.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the presence of the day of Jehovah.’”

00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:03.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s good reason to remain in expectation

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus told us to do so!

00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard,
Jehovah’s organization has set an example.

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:14.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although sometimes
promoting wrong expectations,

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:17.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our publications
have consistently exhorted us

00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “await and keep close in mind
the presence of the day of Jehovah”

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to fix our hope
on God’s promised new world.

00:16:27.715 --> 00:16:30.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since keeping in expectation was appropriate

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:33.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Christians living centuries ago,

00:16:33.972 --> 00:16:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is particularly important for us.

00:16:36.432 --> 00:16:38.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we are living
during Christ’s presence.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sign of his presence
has been in evidence since 1914.

00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:47.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the multifeatured sign,

00:16:47.652 --> 00:16:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which includes worsening world conditions
and global Kingdom preaching,

00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:57.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is proof that we are living
in “the conclusion of the system of things.”

00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:59.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since Jesus did not say

00:16:59.122 --> 00:17:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how long that period
of time would go, or go on,

00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:06.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the final end arrives,

00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:10.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to be especially vigilant, watchful.

00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt
that world conditions are deteriorating.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how bad do you expect conditions
to become before the great tribulation?

00:17:19.475 --> 00:17:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that most people

00:17:21.936 --> 00:17:24.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would take “no note” of his presence,

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:28.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
carrying on with life’s normal activities

00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:30.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it is too late.

00:17:30.695 --> 00:17:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, the Scriptures indicate
that world conditions during the last days

00:17:35.325 --> 00:17:37.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would not become so extreme

00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:42.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people would be forced
to believe that the end is near.

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
for the composite sign to serve its purpose,

00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:52.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fulfillment of it
would have to be obvious enough

00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to command the attention of those

00:17:55.178 --> 00:17:57.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been obeying Jesus’ counsel

00:17:57.889 --> 00:18:00.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “keep on the watch.”

00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:03.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that has been the case since 1914.

00:18:03.603 --> 00:18:07.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that time onward,
the features of the sign

00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been undergoing fulfillment.

00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:13.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, we are now living in the time

00:18:13.446 --> 00:18:17.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “the conclusion of the system of things.”

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, then, should Christians today keep

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:23.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in orientation or expectation?

00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out of obedience to Jesus Christ,

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of love for him,

00:18:29.837 --> 00:18:33.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of faith in his promises,

00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:38.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we recognize the sign of his presence.

00:18:38.012 --> 00:18:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our expectations are based,

00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:44.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not on a naive readiness to believe anything,

00:18:44.644 --> 00:18:48.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on solid Scriptural evidence
that compels us

00:18:48.606 --> 00:18:52.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain vigilant, awake, watchful and, yes,

00:18:52.402 --> 00:18:56.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in expectation of the end
of this wicked system.

00:18:57.824 --> 00:19:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us have been keeping awake
spiritually already for decades.

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, let us not allow the passing of time

00:19:06.874 --> 00:19:11.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to weaken our resolve to keep in expectation.

00:19:11.546 --> 00:19:14.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be ready for Jesus’ arrival

00:19:14.674 --> 00:19:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Executioner to end this system of things.

00:19:19.095 --> 00:19:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Jesus exhorted his followers

00:19:22.473 --> 00:19:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with the prophecy

00:19:24.767 --> 00:19:28.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mark chapter 13, starting with verse 33:

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:31.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep looking, keep awake,

00:19:31.816 --> 00:19:34.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you do not know
when the appointed time is.

00:19:34.652 --> 00:19:36.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is like a man traveling abroad

00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:38.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who left his house and gave the authority

00:19:38.698 --> 00:19:41.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to his slaves, to each one his work,

00:19:41.409 --> 00:19:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and commanded the doorkeeper
to keep on the watch.

00:19:44.287 --> 00:19:46.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch, therefore,

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:49.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you do not know
when the master of the house is coming,

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether late in the day or at midnight

00:19:52.962 --> 00:19:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or before dawn or early in the morning,

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order that when he comes suddenly,

00:19:58.718 --> 00:20:00.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he does not find you sleeping.

00:20:00.887 --> 00:20:04.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I say to you, I say to all:
Keep on the watch.”

00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:09.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon recognizing
that Christ’s presence

00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:11.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began in 1914,

00:20:11.606 --> 00:20:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ followers rightly prepared

00:20:13.983 --> 00:20:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a possible early arrival of the end.

00:20:17.487 --> 00:20:21.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did so by intensifying
their Kingdom-preaching work.

00:20:21.115 --> 00:20:24.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus indicated that he might come later

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:27.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at “dawn or early in the morning,” he said.

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:31.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that happened,
how were his followers to respond?

00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:34.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “<i>Keep </i>on the watch.”

00:20:34.629 --> 00:20:39.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a long wait
would not justify mentally postponing the end

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or totally dismissing their expectations.

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:46.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the prophet Habakkuk,

00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:50.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was commissioned to foretell
the destruction of Jerusalem.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assured his faithful prophet

00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the foretold destruction
would “not be late.”

00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:03.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Keep in expectation”

00:21:03.241 --> 00:21:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Habakkuk chapter 1
and also chapter 2, verse 3.

00:21:08.204 --> 00:21:12.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t you get discouraged by the fact

00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:15.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have been preaching
for a long time, perhaps decades.

00:21:15.878 --> 00:21:19.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world,
all will have reason to reflect

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the fact that all the foretold events

00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
associated with the conclusion
of the system of things

00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:29.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did indeed take place, or have taken place.

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:33.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditating on how matters actually turned out

00:21:33.813 --> 00:21:37.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will further strengthen
our confidence in Jehovah

00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his promises to be fulfilled.

00:21:39.902 --> 00:21:42.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will surely be thankful to God,

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who ‘has placed times
and seasons in his own jurisdiction.’

00:21:46.242 --> 00:21:48.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He exhorted us to live with an awareness

00:21:48.995 --> 00:21:52.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the end of all things has drawn close.”

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible predicts that political powers

00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:57.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will turn against false religion.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should not assume that much time is needed

00:22:00.756 --> 00:22:03.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the state of this world to develop

00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:05.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point where political powers,

00:22:05.553 --> 00:22:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Revelation 17:16,

00:22:09.098 --> 00:22:12.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 turn on the world empire of false religion.

00:22:12.852 --> 00:22:15.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says there in Revelation chapter 17:

00:22:15.897 --> 00:22:20.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the ten horns that you saw
and the [political] wild beast,

00:22:20.443 --> 00:22:24.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“these will hate
the prostitute [false religion]

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and will make her devastated and naked,

00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:30.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will eat up her flesh
and completely burn her with fire.”

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us bear in mind that God

00:22:34.332 --> 00:22:37.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will “put it into their hearts”
to make that move

00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:40.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and this could happen
swiftly and at any time!

00:22:40.546 --> 00:22:44.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The end of this entire
system of things is not far off.

00:22:44.175 --> 00:22:46.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With good reason,
we should heed Jesus’ warning:

00:22:46.761 --> 00:22:49.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts

00:22:49.555 --> 00:22:52.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“never become weighed down with overeating

00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and heavy drinking and anxieties of life,

00:22:55.603 --> 00:22:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suddenly that day
be instantly upon you as a snare.”

00:22:59.815 --> 00:23:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us be resolved
to serve Jehovah with a sense of urgency,

00:23:04.654 --> 00:23:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that he “acts in behalf

00:23:06.822 --> 00:23:10.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who keep in expectation of him.”

00:23:10.368 --> 00:23:13.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we await the end
of the present wicked system of things,

00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us heed
the disciple Jude’s inspired words,

00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:21.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jude 20, 21:
“Beloved ones, build yourselves up

00:23:21.587 --> 00:23:25.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on your most holy faith,
and pray with holy spirit,

00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:27.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to keep yourselves in God’s love,

00:23:27.718 --> 00:23:30.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while you await the mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with everlasting life in view.”

00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:37.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing so, you Gilead students
and each one of us here

00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:40.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will prove ourselves ready, yes,

00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:44.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always prepared
for the good work the Christ will do

00:23:44.694 --> 00:23:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for every good work

00:23:47.363 --> 00:23:50.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we strive to do on a daily basis.

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:58.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we have
the highlight of the program.

00:23:58.499 --> 00:24:01.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll have the presentation of the diplomas.

00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:03.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

(actually, I think he has
the hardest job here today)

is Brother William Malenfant,

He has the task of getting

00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:19.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

the hospitality shown was much more

“The majority of the class
are Bethelites and,

00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:43.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to a certain degree,
we understand how much work, time,

“Additionally, we have seen
such wisdom and love

“through the ‘gifts in men’
who have been used as instructors.

“You never drew attention to yourselves,

“how you glorified and magnified Jehovah.

00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:54.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As Proverbs 10:22 says:

“‘It is the blessing of Jehovah

“We have been enriched
by making new lifelong friends,

00:34:02.603 --> 00:34:05.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but Gilead training does not end here.

“As we depart

“our determination is
to stick ever closer to Jehovah

“We wish to convey
our gratitude and love to all of you.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your brothers and sisters,
the 147th class of Gilead.”

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:57.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at the beginning
of this graduation program,

00:34:57.574 --> 00:34:59.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I posed a question to all of you,

00:34:59.993 --> 00:35:02.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that question was,

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How far will you go?

00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:11.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in order to fully serve
our brothers and sisters

00:35:11.004 --> 00:35:16.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to love them, to train them, to help them—

00:35:16.009 --> 00:35:21.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have to make
major sacrifices in your life.

00:35:21.014 --> 00:35:23.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you are making them right now

00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:28.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to accept some
of the assignments that you received today.

00:35:28.105 --> 00:35:30.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I wanted to share
with you a Bible account

00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:33.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’d like for you
to try to keep in your minds,

00:35:33.568 --> 00:35:36.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you never know
when the phone is going to ring

00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:38.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that e-mail is going to come.

00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:43.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 2 Chronicles chapter 25,

00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:48.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here we read about King Amaziah.

00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:51.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very interesting
what the Bible says here.

00:35:51.753 --> 00:35:56.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it mentions in verse 6
of 2 Chronicles chapter 25

00:35:56.758 --> 00:35:59.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Amaziah hired from Israel

00:35:59.803 --> 00:36:04.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
100,000 mighty warriors
for 100 silver talents.

00:36:04.808 --> 00:36:08.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I didn’t do all the math.

00:36:08.061 --> 00:36:10.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Brother Splane.

00:36:10.063 --> 00:36:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I understand that this is well,

00:36:14.443 --> 00:36:18.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well over $1,000,000 in today’s money.

00:36:18.405 --> 00:36:22.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a very,
very large sum that Amaziah had paid,

00:36:23.952 --> 00:36:27.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but after he had done so, look at verse 7:

00:36:27.497 --> 00:36:30.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But a man of the true God
came to him, saying:

00:36:30.917 --> 00:36:35.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O king, do not let
the army of Israel go with you,

00:36:35.797 --> 00:36:40.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for Jehovah is not with Israel,
not with any of the Ephraimites.

00:36:40.802 --> 00:36:45.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But go by yourself, . . .
and be courageous in battle.

00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Otherwise, the true God could cause you
to stumble before an enemy,

00:36:50.812 --> 00:36:55.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God has the power
to help and to cause stumbling.’”

00:36:55.817 --> 00:37:00.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how did Amaziah react to that counsel?

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:04.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see right away in verse 9:

00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:07.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Amaziah said to the man of the true God:

00:37:07.162 --> 00:37:11.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But what about the 100 talents
that I have given to the troops of Israel?’”

00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:16.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right?
He had already paid the money.

00:37:16.546 --> 00:37:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, how could we apply
that principle to you?

00:37:21.384 --> 00:37:26.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many of you
may have made major sacrifices already

00:37:26.389 --> 00:37:28.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your career of full-time service.

00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve had to learn a new language.

00:37:31.394 --> 00:37:34.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve made an investment of time

00:37:34.356 --> 00:37:38.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your department at Bethel
or in your field assignment,

00:37:38.777 --> 00:37:41.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now you’re being asked
to do something different

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps learn a whole new language

00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:49.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or go from the field to Bethel
or from Bethel to the field.

00:37:49.204 --> 00:37:52.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, will you feel like Amaziah?

00:37:52.374 --> 00:37:56.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you say, ‘What about those 100 talents

00:37:56.503 --> 00:37:58.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’ve already paid?’

00:37:58.797 --> 00:38:03.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s the answer
that I’d like for you to keep in your mind.

00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:06.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man of the true God, in verse 9,

00:38:06.638 --> 00:38:11.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answered Amaziah, and this is what he said:

00:38:11.017 --> 00:38:16.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah has the means
to give you much more than that.”

00:38:16.022 --> 00:38:21.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the thought
you want to treasure in your mind and heart.

00:38:21.027 --> 00:38:26.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re asked to take up
some new challenge, some new assignment

00:38:26.032 --> 00:38:29.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and it may mean walking away 

00:38:29.077 --> 00:38:32.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a large investment
that you have already made—

00:38:32.831 --> 00:38:35.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember: Jehovah has the power

00:38:35.792 --> 00:38:39.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you much more than that.

00:38:39.838 --> 00:38:42.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with those thoughts in mind,

00:38:42.465 --> 00:38:47.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may you go with all of our love,
with our deep respect,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the blessing
of our wonderful,

00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our amazing God, Jehovah.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:04.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve now come
to the point where we can enjoy

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:08.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the principal talk
of our Gilead graduation program.

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is entitled
“The Righteous One Will Get Up,”

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have Brother Mark Sanderson

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body to deliver that for us.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for those of you who are graduating today,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:30.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is indeed one
of the happiest days of your entire life.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And rightly so,

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:37.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because today represents a wonderful milestone

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:42.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after years of faithfully pursuing a spiritual career.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I have to be realistic.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:50.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hate to be a downer at this moment,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but realistically,

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to say that not every day

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your life ahead
is going to be as happy as this one.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do we say that?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course,
we know that Satan rules this world.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And living in these last days 
that we live in brings us anxiety,

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes even fear.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is full of what-ifs.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, those two words “what if”

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can send us down all kinds of roads
that can be quite terrifying.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For you who are graduating today,

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe it’s something like:
‘What if I can’t learn the new language?

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or what if I can’t adapt to a new culture?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or what if I get home and the brothers

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a new assignment
for me that I’m not expecting?’

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s for you.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for all of us who are here in this audience

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps even for our larger audience
via JW Broadcasting®,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe it’s questions like:

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What if I face persecution,

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘even violent persecution?

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What if there’s a natural disaster?

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What if I become seriously ill?

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if I lose a loved one in death?’

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those questions can seem hypothetical,

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many of our brothers
and sisters around the world

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are facing those situations right now.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For them, it’s not a matter of what if;

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s what is.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:28.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers, while it is absolutely certain

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are going to experience calamities

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we live in the last days

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:37.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we expect “critical times hard to deal with,”

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:41.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is something that is equally certain

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is no “what if.”

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a fundamental principle that applies

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:51.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every single righteous
and faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that principle can fill us

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with confidence and courage.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is this principle?

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:03.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles;
let’s look at Proverbs chapter 24.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you’re turning your Bibles there,

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:11.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll just remind you that in the Proverbs,

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of these proverbial thoughts

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually are made up of two verses,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so this one begins in verse 15.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It actually begins with a warning,

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is what it says:

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not wickedly lie in ambush

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“near the home of the righteous one;

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:33.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not destroy his place of rest.”

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why?

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it that you
should not attack the righteous one?

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:42.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, notice the reason, 
and here’s this fundamental truth:

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the righteous one may fall seven times,

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will get up again,

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:55.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the wicked
will be made to stumble by calamity.”

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, let’s take this verse apart.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it really trying to tell us?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, what does it mean to fall?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:08.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The March 15, 2013, Watchtower,

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commenting on Proverbs 24:16,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:16.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
defined fall as “an adversity or a setback.”

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One reference work says:

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Falls’ is the word that can simply mean

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:26.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘falls over or falls down.’

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:30.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But it also has a figurative meaning
of [now notice this]

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘experiences disaster or ruin.’”

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the sense here.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:41.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does it mean, then, to get up?

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:43.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same reference work goes on to say:

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Likewise, ‘rises again’

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:50.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can simply mean ‘gets up after falling down.’

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:53.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But here, it has the figurative sense

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of ‘overcomes adversity

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or becomes prosperous again.’”

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, why seven times?

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:05.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same reference work says:

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:09.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Most translations render ‘seven times’ literally,

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the figure seven

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:15.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“probably has
its Hebrew symbolic meaning in this context,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“namely, ‘completeness.’

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For that reason, some translations read:

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:26.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Even if a righteous person
falls down many times,

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:29.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will always get up.’”

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Contemporary English Version says:

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:36.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if good people fall seven times,
they will get back up.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when trouble strikes the wicked,
that’s the end of them.”

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:47.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Proverbs 24:15, 16 trying to tell us?

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:52.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, basically, 
that when a wicked person experiences calamity,

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:56.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s conquered; he will not get up.

00:05:56.322 --> 00:06:00.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not the case for a righteous one.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A righteous person will get up;

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will not give up.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will overcome calamity,

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:11.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will become prosperous again.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:14.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, verse 15, in effect, says:

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t even try to set a trap for the righteous one

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because no matter how hard
you knock him down,

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s going to get up again.’

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:26.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why?

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it that the righteous one gets up?

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:32.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it because he’s just so strong
and he’s just so personally resilient?

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:34.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to look at the cross reference

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Proverbs 24:16.

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the scripture?

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Psalm 34:19.

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:49.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here the psalmist David
expresses a similar thought

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what we just read here in Proverbs,

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he adds an important detail.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:58.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That verse says:
“Many are the hardships

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or if you look at the footnote, “calamities”]

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the righteous one,

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:09.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah rescues him from them all.”

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:14.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah helps the righteous one to get up.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:19.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if we go back
to that March 15, 2013, Watchtower,

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:23.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it commented on Proverbs 24:16, it said:

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:27.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will not allow those trusting in him

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to stumble or to experience a fall

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:34.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—[that is] an adversity
or a setback in their worship—

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:38.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from which they cannot recover.”

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers, what does that mean?

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:45.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean that somehow Jehovah
is going to intervene miraculously

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:49.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every time one of his servants
experiences calamity?

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:50.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:55.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has taught his righteous ones

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:58.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they need to do in times of calamity.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:03.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They know that they
must ‘keep on seeking first God’s Kingdom

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and God’s righteousness,’

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Matthew 6:33 says.

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:13.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, what does the righteous one
do when calamity comes?

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, it doesn’t stop
the righteous one from praying;

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t stop him from attending meetings

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:22.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or talking to others about his faith.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:27.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he keeps on doing what pleases Jehovah,

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:30.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the face of calamity.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:33.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doing what is right

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:35.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what helps him to recover

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:40.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from whatever calamity may come upon him.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the apostle Paul

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:46.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a wonderful example of the truth of this principle.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in 2 Corinthians chapter 11,

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s just remind ourselves

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:57.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some of the calamities
that came upon the apostle Paul.

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians chapter 11

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—let’s begin reading in verse 23.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:07.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says:
“Are they ministers of Christ?

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:11.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reply like a madman,
I am more outstandingly one:

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have done more work,
been imprisoned more often,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“suffered countless beatings,
and experienced many near-deaths.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:24.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“three times I was beaten with rods,

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“once I was stoned,

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:32.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“three times I experienced shipwreck,

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:36.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a night and a day
I have spent in the open sea;

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:39.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in journeys often,
in dangers from rivers,

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:44.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in dangers from robbers,
in dangers from my own people,

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:48.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in dangers from the nations,
in dangers in the city,

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:53.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in dangers in the wilderness,
in dangers at sea,

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:56.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in dangers among false brothers,

00:09:56.395 --> 00:10:00.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in labor and toil,
in sleepless nights often,

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:05.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in hunger and thirst,
frequently without food,

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:09.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in cold and lacking clothing.”

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:11.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers, honestly,

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people would’ve been conquered

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by just one of those things, isn’t it true?

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Paul kept getting up;
he kept getting up and going on.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was his conclusion?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just read it in 2 Corinthians chapter 4,

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:31.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look here at verse 8.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says:
“We are hard-pressed in every way,

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:41.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not cramped beyond movement;

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are perplexed,
but not absolutely with no way out;

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:50.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are persecuted but not abandoned.”

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now notice this one:

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:56.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are knocked down, but not destroyed.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:59.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always we endure in our body

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the death-dealing treatment that Jesus suffered,

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:05.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our body.”

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see that?

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:12.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Knocked down [knocked down],

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:14.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not destroyed.”

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Righteous Paul was not destroyed

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:22.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the adverse experiences that came to him.

00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:25.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t allow calamity to stop him

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from giving that next witness,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from offering that next prayer to Jehovah,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from taking advantage of the next opportunity

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet with his brothers.

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:40.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, that’s what a righteous person does.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:44.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He keeps on seeking Jehovah

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeking to please him.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because Paul did that,

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:52.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was always able to get up

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:54.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the help of Jehovah.

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:58.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, brothers, that’s true for Paul,

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:02.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also true for every one

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s faithful and righteous servants

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all around this earth.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to introduce to you

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:14.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three different faithful servants of Jehovah

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have also experienced the truth

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:21.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Proverbs 24:16.

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:25.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Brother Michael Legaspi

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:27.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Philippines.

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:31.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Typhoon Haiyan struck in 2013,

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:35.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michael went with his wife and his young son

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:39.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Kingdom Hall
in Tacloban City to seek shelter.

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There had been many typhoons before.

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:45.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was not an unusual event in the Philippines,

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:49.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time, there was something different.

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:53.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the first time in recent memory

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:56.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was a storm surge

00:12:56.108 --> 00:13:00.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a wall of water 15 feet high,

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:03.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or four and a half meters high,

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that struck the Kingdom Hall.

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:09.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The walls and the roof collapsed.

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:12.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michael worked very, very hard

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to rescue his wife

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other brothers and sisters

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were trapped under the debris.

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly, his wife had already perished.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, in the water by this time,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he heard his son cry out to him:

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:32.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Papa! Papa!”

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:38.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reached out,
and he grabbed him in the water.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of his exhaustion

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from already helping the brothers to escape

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from under the debris

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of the cold temperature of the water,

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he became unconscious.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:56.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he woke up, his son was gone;

00:13:56.802 --> 00:14:01.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he too had perished in this storm.

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at first,

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michael was inconsolable.

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:08.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He blamed himself.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He felt that there was something more

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could have done to save them.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the elders shepherded him.

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:20.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They helped him to see
that there was nothing that he could have done.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:24.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The storm was beyond the power of any man.

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:28.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even in those difficult times,

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:31.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michael continued with his spiritual program.

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:34.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued to serve as an elder

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:37.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a regular pioneer.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:39.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers encouraged him,

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why don’t you begin to volunteer
at the disaster relief center?”

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:47.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole area was completely devastated;

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:50.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the homes had been destroyed.

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:52.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michael got busy

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:55.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked to help rebuild

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the homes of the local brothers.

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:03.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when that work was finished,
he enrolled as a construction volunteer,

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:05.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working with a group of brothers

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:08.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
building Kingdom Halls within the region.

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then when that work was complete,

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:15.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he volunteered to help a congregation

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:17.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was quite a distance away.

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It required him to travel one and a half hours

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:22.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each way by motorcycle.

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was willing to do it

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:28.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the congregation
needed the help of an elder.

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:32.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, here is Michael today

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:36.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—busy and active in Jehovah’s service.

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:39.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like all righteous ones,

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:42.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michael kept doing Jehovah’s will

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:45.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the terrible calamity that he experienced.

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do you think, brothers?

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think Michael got up?

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Teymur Akhmedov

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lives in Kazakhstan.

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2017, Teymur was arrested

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:13.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a false charge of inciting religious hatred.

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:17.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being in pretrial detention for three months,

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:22.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teymur was sentenced to a five-year prison term.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before his arrest,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teymur was being treated for cancer.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was arrested, his treatment stopped,

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:34.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the disease began to progress.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you talk about calamity.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:40.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only was he in prison because of his faith

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:45.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also had to deal
with life-threatening cancer at the same time.

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:49.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being held for 13 months,

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:54.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teymur was finally allowed to go
to another city for medical care.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here you see Teymur
after surgery in his hospital bed,

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:02.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you notice he’s chained,

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:05.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both at the arm and at the leg.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:12.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the courts had rejected
multiple appeals to have Teymur released,

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it appeared that it was impossible.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:17.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All options had been exhausted.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:21.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet Teymur was told at this point,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can be released
if you’re willing to sign a confession.”

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:30.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The authorities told him to write out

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:35.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had made a mistake
in speaking to other people about his beliefs

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:38.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was now sorry for his actions.

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:42.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teymur absolutely refused.

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:45.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told the authorities
that he would rather sit in prison

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a clear conscience

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:50.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than be released with a guilty one.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:54.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:57.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after fourteen and a half months in prison,

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the president of Kazakhstan gave Teymur

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:04.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a full pardon without any admission of guilt,

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was released.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:12.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you see Teymur
in a recent photo taken with his dear wife.

00:18:13.745 --> 00:18:17.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that helped Teymur to get up

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite imprisonment

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dealing with a life-threatening illness?

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:22.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what he said:

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We each have a choice

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:30.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—whether to stand by God’s principles
or to ignore them.

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:33.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we stand by God’s principles,

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:37.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can get through any test successfully.”

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:44.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teymur overcame the adversity,
would you agree?

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He truly got up.

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:59.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Sister Laura French.

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:01.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She began Bethel service

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on May 1, 1926.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:08.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was part of this small Bethel family

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Canada,

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:11.583 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made up of less than 20 persons.

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 1936,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became apparent
that the branch servant in Canada

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an apostate.

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:23.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, the matter was investigated.

00:19:23.762 --> 00:19:27.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And although Sister French
was not involved with the apostasy,

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:30.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had been a roommate with one of the sisters

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:34.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was working closely with the branch servant.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, she was wrongly viewed

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of his supporters.

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:42.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so on May 1, 1936,

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:46.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was among a group of seven Bethelites

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:50.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were dismissed from Bethel,
along with the branch servant.

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Sister French do?

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:56.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never complained.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:20:00.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did not say that it was unfair, or unjust,

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although she said that initially she was hurt.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:06.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She decided that the best remedy

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:09.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be to go on serving Jehovah.

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:12.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, 
“After leaving Bethel,

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I had four marvelous years

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the pioneer service.”

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:19.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first two years,

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:23.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she and another sister lived in a tent

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:25.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while preaching in a large area

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:28.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there were no congregations

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:30.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s people.

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, she and her pioneer partner

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked from a house car.

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These faithful sisters

00:20:36.768 --> 00:20:40.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly worked hard for Jehovah.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:44.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in 1940, Sister French came to Toronto

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:46.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a short vacation

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:51.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when suddenly the ban 
on Jehovah’s Witnesses struck.

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:55.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To her surprise and delight,

00:20:55.153 --> 00:21:00.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was invited to come and work
at the underground branch office.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:03.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with the approval of Brother Rutherford,

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:07.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister French returned to Bethel service

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:09.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1940

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continued to serve there

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until she finished her earthly course

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:18.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on December 23, 1990.

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:20.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of her earthly life,

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she said she was so happy

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:26.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she had decided to go pioneering

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she was dismissed from Bethel.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of that group who were dismissed,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was the only one

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who continued to serve Jehovah faithfully.

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:42.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister French kept doing the right thing,

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:46.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when she was misjudged by others.

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:50.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She overcame an unjust situation;

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:54.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she overcame that adversity; she truly got up.

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you agree?

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:09.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers, what have we learned

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from considering this principle

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 24:16?

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:18.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When calamity strikes,

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:22.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you truly may feel knocked down.

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:25.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not know the details

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:28.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of exactly how everything is going to work out,

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:32.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will always know what to do next.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will know how to pray;

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:37.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll know to go to that next meeting;

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:40.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll know to go out in the ministry;

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll know to always make decisions

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:45.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will please Jehovah.

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:48.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you do so,

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:51.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will show you the way to move on

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:56.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to get up
from any calamity that you might face.

00:22:56.742 --> 00:23:00.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was true of the apostle Paul.

00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:03.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was true of Michael Legaspi.

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was true of Teymur Akhmedov.

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:09.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was true of Laura French.

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:13.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it will be true for all of you.

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:15.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember this:

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:18.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When calamity knocks you down,

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:22.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seek Jehovah, and you’ll rebound.

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:26.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the principle say?

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:28.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘For though the righteous one

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘may fall seven times,

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:35.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will get up again.’

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:38.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that confidence in your hearts,

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may you go to your assignments

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:43.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all of our love

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:45.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the rich blessing

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:49.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our marvelous and amazing God, Jehovah.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that brings us now
to the point in our program

00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the presentation of the diplomas,

Graduates
—that has a nice sound to it, doesn’t it?

00:33:15.376 --> 00:33:17.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It came quickly.

00:33:17.412 --> 00:33:21.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ve been asked to give
a few comments here at the end

00:33:21.315 --> 00:33:26.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to include this point,
so I’ll begin with it:

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in 2011,

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:33.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body adjusted
the objective of Gilead training

00:33:33.661 --> 00:33:37.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to help further strengthen and stabilize

00:33:37.632 --> 00:33:40.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the field and branch organization.

00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:42.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result,

00:33:42.203 --> 00:33:45.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have seen
Jehovah’s rich blessing on this adjustment

00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:49.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it relates 
to branch and country committees worldwide.

00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:54.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the time 
of the graduation of the 132nd class,

00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:59.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
182 graduates
have been appointed to a committee,

00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:04.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either during or sometime
after their training at Gilead.

00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:08.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a wonderful fact, isn’t it?

00:34:08.229 --> 00:34:13.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s something
that is really proving to be a blessing

00:34:13.234 --> 00:34:16.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide field
and to our dear brotherhood and, above all,

00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:20.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in upholding and honoring Jehovah’s name.

00:34:20.374 --> 00:34:23.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a marvelous arrangement.

00:34:23.077 --> 00:34:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now with this in mind,
just for a couple of minutes,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to give
concluding comments on this topic:

00:34:29.684 --> 00:34:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maintain Your ‘Shield of Faith.’”

00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:36.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when you
are settled into your assignments

00:34:36.424 --> 00:34:40.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps with new responsibilities—

00:34:40.061 --> 00:34:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to remain watchful

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:46.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you stay focused
on what is most important,

00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:49.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely, the doing of Jehovah’s will.

00:34:49.871 --> 00:34:54.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The danger can come
when we feel that we’ve achieved most

00:34:54.475 --> 00:34:57.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even all of our spiritual goals.

00:34:57.645 --> 00:35:00.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we allow that to happen,

00:35:00.047 --> 00:35:03.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our interests could turn to other things.

00:35:03.084 --> 00:35:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if we lose sight of the point

00:35:06.053 --> 00:35:09.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the purpose
behind what it means to follow Jesus,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could start to center our thoughts
on other goals (it could happen),

00:35:14.295 --> 00:35:16.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even material things.

00:35:16.464 --> 00:35:18.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t let this happen to you.

00:35:18.466 --> 00:35:21.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your shield of faith strong.

00:35:21.736 --> 00:35:23.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible times,

00:35:23.738 --> 00:35:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soldiers repaired and secured
their shields between battles.

00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:32.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They treasured
those protective pieces of armor.

00:35:32.647 --> 00:35:35.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because their shields
were often covered with leather,

00:35:35.983 --> 00:35:40.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the soldiers would rub oil
on to the shield to help preserve it

00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:44.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep the metal parts free from rust.

00:35:44.158 --> 00:35:47.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a soldier found damage or weakness,
what did he do?

00:35:47.962 --> 00:35:51.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He immediately made
the needed repairs to his shield.

00:35:51.532 --> 00:35:56.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,
he was always ready for the next battle.

00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:58.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to keep this up in a spiritual way.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over time, a brother or sister

00:36:01.843 --> 00:36:04.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might lay down his or her shield of faith

00:36:04.478 --> 00:36:07.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go after things that have no lasting value.

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:12.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil wants nothing more
than for us to neglect our faith

00:36:12.854 --> 00:36:15.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and open up our heart to his attacks.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for this reason,

00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:20.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul, the apostle Paul,
was inspired to say

00:36:20.795 --> 00:36:24.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those who go
after material riches, for instance,

00:36:24.866 --> 00:36:28.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would cultivate
“many senseless and harmful desires.”

00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:31.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He added:
“Flee from these things.”

00:36:31.472 --> 00:36:36.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, ultimately,
we are each responsible for how large

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how strong our shield of faith proves to be.

00:36:40.548 --> 00:36:43.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we show that we are strengthening

00:36:43.918 --> 00:36:46.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith in Jehovah and his Son

00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we take time
to continue caring for our spiritual needs.

00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:53.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t take liberties with your spiritual routine

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because you’ve graduated
from this wonderful school.

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:00.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t become self-satisfied

00:37:00.334 --> 00:37:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of resting
on a privilege you may come to enjoy.

00:37:04.438 --> 00:37:06.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not the point of it, is it?

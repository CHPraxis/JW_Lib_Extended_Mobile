00:12.365 --> 00:14.868
I thought I would find you here. 


00:14.868 --> 00:16.870
Joanna, my sister. 


00:16.870 --> 00:18.000
Please sit. 


00:27.005 --> 00:30.000
Listen to this: 


00:31.302 --> 00:35.805
“You are a holy people to Jehovah your God, 


00:35.805 --> 00:40.393
“and Jehovah your God 
has chosen you to become his people, 


00:40.393 --> 00:42.688
“his special property, 


00:42.688 --> 00:45.440
out of all the peoples 
who are on the face of the earth.” 


00:45.440 --> 00:47.442
The words of Moses, 


00:47.442 --> 00:49.445
speaking to our people 
before they entered this land. 


00:49.445 --> 00:51.197
Yes. 
And just before that, 


00:51.197 --> 00:56.000
he told them to destroy 
all the idols of the Canaanites. 


00:58.453 --> 01:02.666
I wonder if there are more idols 
in the land now than there were then. 


01:02.667 --> 01:07.379
At every turn, 
our people bow and pray to them. 


01:07.378 --> 01:10.090
You’re doing all you can. 


01:10.090 --> 01:11.175
How dare you promote this filth! 


01:11.175 --> 01:12.258
But they don’t listen. 


01:12.258 --> 01:13.010
The true God . . . 


01:13.010 --> 01:13.927
Stop right there. 


01:13.927 --> 01:14.929
I listen. 


01:14.928 --> 01:15.930
Moses came down from the mountain. 


01:15.930 --> 01:16.597
Stop talking. 


01:16.597 --> 01:19.000
And I think you’re great. 


01:21.018 --> 01:23.311
You’re like Elijah. 


01:23.312 --> 01:26.607
I’m surprised Jehovah uses me at all. 


01:26.607 --> 01:28.609
Well, I’m not. 


01:28.608 --> 01:30.568
You always want to do the right thing. 


01:30.568 --> 01:35.000
It makes us proud. 


02:03.060 --> 02:06.730
Jonah! 


02:06.730 --> 02:09.000
Jonah! 


02:11.360 --> 02:13.362
Ye— 
Yes, my Lord. 


02:13.362 --> 02:15.447
Get up, 


02:15.447 --> 02:17.700
go to Nineveh the great city, 


02:17.700 --> 02:20.535
and proclaim judgment against her, 


02:20.535 --> 02:25.248
for their wickedness 
has come to my attention. 


02:25.248 --> 02:28.460
Nineveh? 


02:28.460 --> 02:31.000
Nineveh. 


02:32.088 --> 02:33.006
They deserve to die. 


02:33.007 --> 02:33.924
It’s not his responsibility. 


02:33.923 --> 02:35.133
He’s just going to get himself killed. 


02:35.133 --> 02:36.135
You need to talk to him. 


02:36.135 --> 02:39.000
Someone needs to talk to him. 


02:48.105 --> 02:51.608
We’ve prepared a meal for you. 


02:51.608 --> 02:54.820
I’m not hungry. 


02:54.820 --> 02:56.947
They haven’t spoken a word to me in hours. 


02:56.947 --> 02:59.492
Your brothers are young, Jonah. 


02:59.492 --> 03:03.370
The news you brought to us this morning 


03:03.370 --> 03:04.705
—it was heavy. 


03:04.705 --> 03:07.000
What did your brothers say? 


03:09.125 --> 03:11.878
Izliah is afraid they will kill me; 


03:11.878 --> 03:13.338
skin me alive. 


03:13.338 --> 03:15.965
He doesn’t think they should even be warned. 


03:15.965 --> 03:20.512
Just let Jehovah slaughter them all. 


03:20.512 --> 03:23.682
And Eber doesn’t believe they will listen. 


03:23.682 --> 03:26.144
What do you think? 


03:26.143 --> 03:29.730
I think that if it’s Jehovah’s will 
to destroy them, 


03:29.730 --> 03:33.692
he wouldn’t have commanded me to go. 


03:33.692 --> 03:36.404
But I do think Eber is right. 


03:36.403 --> 03:37.653
Why would they listen? 


03:37.653 --> 03:39.781
Our own people don’t listen. 


03:39.782 --> 03:42.534
And yet the warning still goes out. 


03:42.533 --> 03:46.621
But when has Jehovah 
ever asked a prophet to go to a foreign land 


03:46.622 --> 03:50.167
to preach judgment against it? 


03:50.167 --> 03:53.754
Jonah, I— 


03:53.753 --> 03:56.215
I don’t have all the answers. 


03:56.215 --> 03:59.552
To be sent to declare judgment 
in the heart of Assyria, 


03:59.552 --> 04:03.555
it’s unlike anything Jehovah 
has asked of his prophets to do before. 


04:03.555 --> 04:06.558
But if it’s Jehovah’s will 
that you should go, 


04:06.558 --> 04:09.226
then you should go. 


04:09.227 --> 04:13.899
He must have good reason 
for sending you there. 


04:13.898 --> 04:16.000
Trust him. 


04:17.610 --> 04:18.612
Jonah! 


04:18.612 --> 04:19.614
Jonah! 


04:19.613 --> 04:21.656
Jonah, look! 


04:21.657 --> 04:23.075
I got figs! 


04:23.075 --> 04:25.077
I’m going to pack you some cakes too. 


04:25.077 --> 04:28.000
I wish I could go with you. 


04:39.257 --> 04:41.927
Izliah is afraid they will kill me; 


04:41.927 --> 04:44.000
skin me alive. 


05:30.725 --> 05:33.353
You’re leaving without saying good-bye? 


05:33.353 --> 05:35.896
You need to go back inside, Joanna. 


05:35.897 --> 05:38.109
But we had things prepared for you! 


05:38.108 --> 05:41.000
You’ll need them in Nineveh. 


05:43.363 --> 05:45.365
You’re not going to Nineveh, are you? 


05:45.365 --> 05:48.077
No, Tarshish. 


05:48.077 --> 05:49.244
No, Jonah! 


05:49.243 --> 05:50.786
That’s the wrong way! 
Go back! 


05:50.787 --> 05:52.080
We can talk to Father! 


05:52.080 --> 05:54.542
Joanna! 


05:54.542 --> 05:56.585
I can’t go to Nineveh. 


05:56.585 --> 05:58.212
I just can’t do it. 


05:58.212 --> 06:00.922
But what will you do in Tarshish? 


06:00.922 --> 06:02.590
When will you be back? 


06:02.590 --> 06:05.000
I don’t know, maybe never. 


06:06.303 --> 06:08.305
Never? 


06:08.305 --> 06:11.057
Then who’s going to Nineveh? 


06:11.057 --> 06:13.810
Who’s going to tell them what Jehovah said? 


06:13.810 --> 06:15.228
I’m sorry, Joanna. 


06:15.228 --> 06:17.105
I don’t know what Jehovah will do. 


06:17.105 --> 06:19.107
But I just can’t do it. 


06:19.107 --> 06:20.942
It’s too much. 


06:20.942 --> 06:22.485
He doesn’t need me anyway. 


06:22.485 --> 06:23.945
We need you. 


06:23.945 --> 06:26.615
And you’re Jehovah’s prophet. 


06:26.615 --> 06:27.992
You’re like Elijah. 


06:27.992 --> 06:29.619
Remember? 


06:29.618 --> 06:32.328
Not anymore. 


06:32.328 --> 06:33.663
Go home, Joanna. 


06:33.663 --> 06:36.000
I’m sorry. 


06:51.390 --> 06:54.392
If it’s Jehovah’s will 
that you should go, 


06:54.392 --> 06:57.000
then you should go. 


07:21.920 --> 07:24.000
Trust him. 


08:48.173 --> 08:51.000
Look! 


08:55.680 --> 08:57.723
By the gods. 


08:57.723 --> 09:02.061
Furl the sail! 


09:02.062 --> 09:03.564
Fasten those lines, men! 


09:03.563 --> 09:06.000
Hatches! 


09:07.733 --> 09:12.000
Brace yourselves! 


09:20.830 --> 09:25.000
Secure the cargo! 


09:33.552 --> 09:36.345
Turn into the wave! 


09:36.345 --> 09:39.000
Turn into the wave! 


10:11.130 --> 10:14.843
Captain, we’re taking on too much water! 


10:14.843 --> 10:17.303
Throw the cargo overboard! 


10:17.303 --> 10:20.000
All of it! Now! 


10:24.853 --> 10:25.000
Get it over! 


10:28.482 --> 10:30.359
It’s no use! 


10:30.358 --> 10:32.443
This storm is from the gods! 


10:32.443 --> 10:33.528
Baal! 


10:33.528 --> 10:35.530
Eshmun! 


10:35.530 --> 10:37.000
Melqart! 


10:41.160 --> 10:42.703
Help us! 


10:42.703 --> 10:43.871
Help us! 


10:43.872 --> 10:45.000
Where is the passenger? 


10:47.042 --> 10:49.879
He’s down below! 


10:49.878 --> 10:51.003
He’s down below. 


10:51.003 --> 10:53.000
Please! Save us! Help us!


10:56.217 --> 10:57.469
Why are you sleeping? 


10:57.468 --> 10:59.511
Get up, call out to your god! 


10:59.512 --> 11:02.015
Perhaps the true God 
will show his concern for us, 


11:02.015 --> 11:04.000
and we will not perish. 


11:08.688 --> 11:09.688
Save us! Help us! 


11:09.688 --> 11:11.065
Please, help us, Melqart! 


11:11.065 --> 11:13.067
Please, help us! Baal! 


11:13.067 --> 11:14.110
Save us! Save us! Baal! 


11:14.110 --> 11:15.653
Deliver us! Baal! 


11:15.653 --> 11:20.000
Let’s cast lots to find out 
who is to blame for this calamity! 


11:28.667 --> 11:31.000
It’s him! 


11:35.548 --> 11:37.591
Why has this calamity come upon us? 


11:37.592 --> 11:42.014
It is from the true and living God.  


11:42.013 --> 11:44.265
He has brought this storm because of me. 


11:44.265 --> 11:46.058
Where do you come from? 


11:46.058 --> 11:47.351
What is your country? 


11:47.352 --> 11:48.687
From what people are you? 


11:48.687 --> 11:49.897
I am a Hebrew, 


11:49.897 --> 11:53.190
and I fear Jehovah the God of the heavens, 


11:53.190 --> 11:56.193
the One who made the sea and the dry land. 


11:56.193 --> 11:59.530
I am— 
I was his prophet. 


11:59.530 --> 12:01.032
What have you done? 


12:01.032 --> 12:04.660
He told me to go to Nineveh 
and deliver a message. 


12:04.660 --> 12:06.287
Instead, I ran away. 


12:06.287 --> 12:07.747
What must we do to you 


12:07.747 --> 12:10.875
to make the sea calm down for us?  


12:10.875 --> 12:13.000
What must we do? 


12:14.963 --> 12:17.756
Lift me up and throw me into the sea, 


12:17.757 --> 12:19.634
and the sea will calm down for you; 


12:19.633 --> 12:22.303
for I know that it is because of me 


12:22.303 --> 12:25.000
that this violent storm has come upon you. 


12:27.017 --> 12:28.727
Let’s do it! 


12:28.727 --> 12:30.020
He’ll die! 


12:30.020 --> 12:33.273
If we kill Jehovah’s prophet, 
what will He do to us?


12:33.273 --> 12:35.441
If Jehovah wants him in Nineveh, 


12:35.442 --> 12:40.000
won’t He be angered 
if we throw him overboard? 


12:42.323 --> 12:43.450
Take to the oars, men. 


12:43.450 --> 12:47.000
Row for your lives! 


12:55.962 --> 12:58.130
There’s the land over there. 


12:58.130 --> 12:59.590
Hurry! 


12:59.590 --> 13:01.635
Row! 


13:01.635 --> 13:04.220
Row! 


13:04.220 --> 13:05.430
It’s no use. 


13:05.430 --> 13:08.000
We have to do what Jonah said. 


13:22.572 --> 13:27.577
Jehovah, may we not perish 
because of this man. 


13:27.577 --> 13:30.914
Do not hold us responsible 
for innocent blood, 


13:30.913 --> 13:36.000
since you have done as you pleased, 
O Jehovah. 


14:14.748 --> 14:17.418
He gave his life for us. 


14:17.418 --> 14:20.000
Our gods did nothing. 


14:22.965 --> 14:27.000
We should sacrifice 
to his God for sparing us. 


14:52.495 --> 14:56.165
How am I still alive? 


14:56.165 --> 15:00.000
What will become of me? 


15:02.130 --> 15:05.800
O Jehovah, 


15:05.800 --> 15:08.428
out of the depths of the Grave, 


15:08.428 --> 15:11.346
I cry to you for help. 


15:11.347 --> 15:14.000
Please hear my voice. 


15:15.852 --> 15:20.482
I know I have been driven 
away from your sight! 


15:20.482 --> 15:24.000
How will I gaze again upon your holy temple? 


15:28.280 --> 15:31.000
Oh, may my prayer come in to you. 


15:33.953 --> 15:38.000
With a voice of thanksgiving 
I will sacrifice to you. 


15:40.502 --> 15:45.000
What I have vowed, I will pay. 


16:16.162 --> 16:18.164
Hey! 


16:18.163 --> 16:21.000
Hey, are you OK? 


16:24.212 --> 16:25.964
What happened? 


16:25.963 --> 16:28.591
Are there others? 


16:28.592 --> 16:30.594
We’re here to help. 


16:30.593 --> 16:32.000
What is your name? 


16:34.263 --> 16:37.016
Jonah. 


16:37.017 --> 16:38.309
My name is Jonah.


16:38.308 --> 16:42.000
Grab his other arm; 
we need to get him to the house. 


17:01.875 --> 17:04.000
Papa says you are a prophet. 


17:09.132 --> 17:11.969
I was a prophet. 


17:11.968 --> 17:14.000
Papa says that you 
were swallowed by a big fish. 


17:15.137 --> 17:16.722
Yes. 


17:16.722 --> 17:19.434
Why would a fish swallow you? 


17:19.433 --> 17:21.268
Well, I was in the water. 


17:21.268 --> 17:23.000
Why where you in the water? 


17:24.605 --> 17:26.607
I was on a ship; 


17:26.607 --> 17:28.902
then I was in the water. 


17:28.902 --> 17:32.000
Why were you on a ship? 


17:37.493 --> 17:42.000
Because I tried to run away from Jehovah. 


17:44.042 --> 17:47.670
When you were in the fish, were you scared?


17:47.670 --> 17:49.213
Yes. 


17:49.213 --> 17:51.000
Did you pray a lot? 


17:54.260 --> 17:57.138
Yes. 


17:57.138 --> 18:01.000
Why did you pray to God 
if you were running away from him? 


18:47.897 --> 18:49.065
Father! 


18:49.065 --> 18:50.317
It’s Jonah! 


18:50.317 --> 18:52.069
He’s back! 


18:52.068 --> 18:53.068
Jonah! 


18:53.068 --> 18:54.653
Joanna. 


18:54.653 --> 18:57.198
I thought I wouldn’t see you again. 


18:57.198 --> 18:59.241
I thought you wouldn’t be back. 


18:59.242 --> 19:00.702
I’m so sorry, Joanna. 


19:00.702 --> 19:01.619
Please forgive me. 


19:01.618 --> 19:04.496
Father waited for you to come home every day. 


19:04.497 --> 19:06.000
He never gave up hope. 


19:08.542 --> 19:11.000
What happened? 


19:16.300 --> 19:18.000
A fish? 


19:19.928 --> 19:22.223
How is that possible? 


19:22.223 --> 19:25.100
It was a miracle, Izliah. 


19:25.100 --> 19:28.813
Jehovah saved you. 


19:28.813 --> 19:31.000
So, what will you do now? 


19:33.233 --> 19:36.000
I don’t know. 


19:38.572 --> 19:41.325
I think it’s time 
for everyone to get some rest. 


19:41.325 --> 19:44.953
We can talk more tomorrow. 


19:44.953 --> 19:46.371
Jonah, 


19:46.372 --> 19:49.459
I’m sorry about the things 
I said before you left. 


19:49.458 --> 19:50.751
I didn’t realize . . . 


19:50.752 --> 19:54.000
It’s no matter, Izliah. 


19:55.338 --> 19:57.550
My decision to run was my own. 


19:57.550 --> 20:00.000
Thank you. 


20:08.853 --> 20:11.000
It’s good to have you back. 


20:14.942 --> 20:17.529
Oh, thank you. 


20:17.528 --> 20:20.000
Thank you. 


20:24.118 --> 20:27.371
I’m still proud of you. 


20:27.372 --> 20:30.249
Sleep well, my son. 


20:30.248 --> 20:33.168
Father? 


20:33.168 --> 20:35.170
Yes? 


20:35.170 --> 20:37.923
I can’t stop thinking 
about those men on that ship, 


20:37.923 --> 20:41.676
all the cargo they lost, 


20:41.677 --> 20:44.722
the fear in their eyes. 


20:44.722 --> 20:47.892
What if they didn’t survive? 


20:47.892 --> 20:50.687
I put them in danger. 


20:50.687 --> 20:55.149
Disobedience often hurts others, Jonah, 


20:55.148 --> 20:58.068
not just ourselves. 


20:58.068 --> 21:01.446
We’ll pray for those men. 


21:01.447 --> 21:04.242
Do you think Jehovah will ever use me again? 


21:04.242 --> 21:07.745
He’s shown you mercy, Jonah. 


21:07.745 --> 21:09.872
He brought you home. 


21:09.872 --> 21:12.000
Let’s be content with that for now. 


21:15.587 --> 21:17.000
Father, 


21:20.048 --> 21:23.760
I’m sorry. 


21:23.760 --> 21:25.763
I know, my son. 


21:25.763 --> 21:27.140
I know. 


21:27.140 --> 21:29.000
Let’s try to get some rest. 


21:48.285 --> 21:52.000
Jonah! 


21:53.875 --> 21:56.000
My Lord! 


21:58.295 --> 22:01.382
I am so sorry. 


22:01.382 --> 22:03.425
I am so sorry. 


22:03.425 --> 22:07.012
Get up, 


22:07.012 --> 22:09.640
go to Nineveh the great city, 


22:09.640 --> 22:11.975
and proclaim to her the message 


22:11.975 --> 22:14.000
that I tell you. 


22:16.105 --> 22:17.815
Yes. 


22:17.815 --> 22:18.900
Yes. 


22:18.900 --> 22:21.152
Thank you. 


22:21.152 --> 22:25.000
I will do as you command. 


22:49.222 --> 22:51.807
May Jehovah be with you, my son. 


22:51.807 --> 22:54.310
He saved me from the heart of the sea; 


22:54.310 --> 22:58.000
he can save me again in the days ahead. 


23:01.733 --> 23:03.945
Here, I made these cakes for you. 


23:03.945 --> 23:07.000
Thank you, Joanna. 


23:09.992 --> 23:12.202
How long will it take you to get to Nineveh? 


23:12.202 --> 23:14.747
If all goes well, maybe 40 days. 


23:14.747 --> 23:17.709
May it go well. 


23:17.708 --> 23:20.000
Thanks. 


24:21.730 --> 24:23.732
Where are you traveling to? 


24:23.732 --> 24:25.400
Nineveh.


24:25.400 --> 24:27.027
Really? 


24:27.027 --> 24:28.029
I was just there.


24:28.028 --> 24:28.861
Hmm.


24:28.862 --> 24:30.072
I was selling some horses. 


24:30.072 --> 24:33.000
I’ll tell you this, 
I’m glad to be going home. 


24:34.202 --> 24:36.829
You should really be careful over there. 


24:36.828 --> 24:39.000
That’s what I’ve heard. 


24:40.833 --> 24:42.250
Tell me about it. 


24:42.250 --> 24:44.837
Well, the city is huge. 


24:44.837 --> 24:48.924
It would probably take you 
three days to walk around it. 


24:48.923 --> 24:52.051
The chariots
—they’re the best in the world. 


24:52.052 --> 24:53.054
And the horses . . .


24:53.053 --> 24:53.928
Hmm. 


24:53.928 --> 24:57.056
The horses are magnificent. 


24:57.057 --> 25:00.144
What about the people? 


25:00.143 --> 25:02.000
The people— 


25:03.730 --> 25:05.983
They worship gods of war. 


25:05.983 --> 25:08.193
What do you think they’re like? 


25:08.193 --> 25:11.030
They love conquest and violence; 


25:11.030 --> 25:13.698
it’s like bread to them. 


25:13.698 --> 25:15.910
That’s comforting. 


25:15.910 --> 25:17.912
Hey, don’t worry. 


25:17.912 --> 25:20.664
Just don’t attract any attention to yourself. 


25:20.663 --> 25:24.000
Stick to your business,  
and you’ll be just fine. 


25:25.753 --> 25:28.000
What is your business anyway? 


25:33.552 --> 25:36.889
I’m a prophet of Jehovah. 


25:36.888 --> 25:40.000
He’s sending me 
to proclaim judgment against it. 


27:05.853 --> 27:07.020
Same thing again? 


27:07.020 --> 27:09.000
It’s your fault! 


27:13.152 --> 27:15.195
Hello there, Foreigner.  


27:15.195 --> 27:19.000
Where are you going, Foreigner? 


27:35.883 --> 27:38.000
Hey! Stop! Stop! 


27:42.848 --> 27:44.056
My food! 


27:44.057 --> 27:47.000
Somebody help me! 


27:51.023 --> 27:54.000
Thank you. 


28:30.437 --> 28:31.439
What about the people? 


28:31.438 --> 28:33.000
They worship gods of war. 


28:34.107 --> 28:36.000
What do you think they’re like? 


29:02.762 --> 29:07.474
In—
in just 40 days more, 


29:07.473 --> 29:10.000
Nineveh will be overthrown. 


29:20.653 --> 29:24.491
In just 40 days more, 


29:24.492 --> 29:29.000
Nineveh will be overthrown! 


29:39.255 --> 29:42.000
Who’s the foreigner? 


29:43.010 --> 29:46.222
In just 40 days more, 


29:46.222 --> 29:50.000
Nineveh will be overthrown! 


29:56.565 --> 29:59.067
In just 40 days more, 
Nineveh will be overthrown. 


29:59.067 --> 30:00.944
Who can possibly overthrow our city? 


30:00.943 --> 30:02.655
Is he crazy? 


30:02.655 --> 30:04.698
He looks like an Israelite. 


30:04.698 --> 30:08.000
The true God has spoken. 


30:17.837 --> 30:19.922
The great violence of this city 
has come to the attention of the true God. 


30:19.922 --> 30:22.215
Jehovah, the true God, has spoken. 


30:22.215 --> 30:24.927
This city will be destroyed. 


30:24.927 --> 30:27.595
Nineveh will be overthrown. 


30:27.595 --> 30:30.598
Jehovah, the true God, has spoken. 


30:30.598 --> 30:32.600
Your city will be destroyed. 


30:32.600 --> 30:34.687
In 35 days, 


30:34.687 --> 30:36.980
this city will be destroyed. 


30:36.980 --> 30:40.442
Nineveh will be overthrown. 


30:40.442 --> 30:43.000
This city will be destroyed. 


30:47.032 --> 30:48.367
We can’t just leave everything. 


30:48.367 --> 30:49.619
What should we do? 


30:49.618 --> 30:50.618
Listen! 


30:50.618 --> 30:52.411
He is a prophet 
of the Israelite God, Jehovah. 


30:52.412 --> 30:54.289
What should we do? 
Should we flee the city? 


30:54.288 --> 30:55.998
We can’t just leave everything. 


30:55.998 --> 30:57.375
Leave our homes? 


30:57.375 --> 30:59.000
Where should we go? 


31:03.007 --> 31:04.340
Listen. 


31:04.340 --> 31:05.383
If we repent, 


31:05.383 --> 31:08.000
maybe his God will have mercy on us. 


31:16.353 --> 31:17.353
According to the prophet, 


31:17.353 --> 31:21.233
there are only 20 days left 
until the destruction of the city. 


31:21.233 --> 31:24.445
Throughout the city, 
people are fasting and putting on sackcloth. 


31:24.445 --> 31:27.280
They are asking the prophet 
how Jehovah wants them to behave, 


31:27.280 --> 31:30.533
and they’re trying to do as he says. 


31:30.533 --> 31:32.911
Is that what Jonah is telling them to do?


31:32.912 --> 31:36.082
No, the people simply reason 
that because there’s a warning 


31:36.082 --> 31:38.084
and time before calamity strikes, 


31:38.083 --> 31:42.000
maybe this God will change his mind. 


31:43.963 --> 31:46.508
What else have we learned about Jonah?


31:46.508 --> 31:50.386
A Ninevite reported 
overhearing a conversation of Jonah’s. 


31:50.387 --> 31:53.349
It seems he originally chose not to come. 


31:53.348 --> 31:57.770
Instead, he fled to Tarshish 
but was thrown overboard. 


31:57.770 --> 32:02.440
Then he claims Jehovah sent a fish 
to swallow him and bring him back. 


32:02.440 --> 32:04.693
Is he insane? 


32:04.693 --> 32:06.986
Maybe not. 


32:06.987 --> 32:09.615
This man speaks for the God of Israel 


32:09.615 --> 32:11.617
—a God of miracles, 


32:11.617 --> 32:13.994
known for his greatness and his power. 


32:13.993 --> 32:16.996
He might be powerful in Israel, 
but we have our own gods here. 


32:16.997 --> 32:19.959
True, but Jehovah is the one responsible 


32:19.958 --> 32:23.128
for humiliating the gods of Egypt, 


32:23.128 --> 32:26.465
even destroying their army in the Red Sea. 


32:26.465 --> 32:29.050
He’s also the One 
who brought about the great Flood 


32:29.050 --> 32:31.678
mentioned in our histories. 


32:31.678 --> 32:34.430
He did this because the people of the time 


32:34.430 --> 32:37.000
were extremely violent. 


32:41.147 --> 32:43.899
Call my scribe. 


32:43.898 --> 32:44.900
Help us, please! 


32:44.900 --> 32:46.235
Save us! 


32:46.235 --> 32:49.613
I cannot accept gifts and bribes. 


32:49.613 --> 32:53.000
Jehovah has spoken. 


32:58.080 --> 33:00.873
In 10 days more, 


33:00.873 --> 33:05.000
the true God will overthrow Nineveh! 


33:06.422 --> 33:09.000
The true God has spoken. 


33:15.513 --> 33:20.476
The violence of the city 
has come to the attention of the true God. 


33:20.477 --> 33:21.854
The true God has spoken. 


33:21.853 --> 33:23.980
Nineveh will be overthrown. 


33:23.980 --> 33:26.000
The city will be destroyed. 


33:34.448 --> 33:37.743
Hear the word of the king, people of Nineveh. 


33:37.743 --> 33:40.080
Hear the word of the king! 


33:40.080 --> 33:43.500
“By the decree of the king and his nobles: 


33:43.500 --> 33:46.670
“No man or beast, 


33:46.670 --> 33:50.048
“herd or flock, should eat anything at all. 


33:50.048 --> 33:53.468
“They should not take food, 


33:53.468 --> 33:56.763
“nor should they drink any water. 


33:56.763 --> 33:58.890
“Let them be covered with sackcloth, 


33:58.890 --> 34:01.477
“both man and beast; 


34:01.477 --> 34:04.605
“and let them call out earnestly to God 


34:04.605 --> 34:07.732
“and turn from their evil ways 


34:07.732 --> 34:11.320
“and from the violence they practice. 


34:11.320 --> 34:13.447
“Who knows whether the true God 


34:13.447 --> 34:16.284
“may reconsider what he intends to do 


34:16.283 --> 34:19.828
“and turn from his burning anger, 


34:19.828 --> 34:22.000
so that we may not perish?” 


34:27.418 --> 34:31.000
In three days, 
Nineveh will be overthrown! 


34:35.427 --> 34:37.220
Jehovah has spoken! 


34:37.220 --> 34:40.000
Nineveh will be overthrown! 


35:22.348 --> 35:24.000
Something should be happening; 


35:25.268 --> 35:27.561
there’s nothing. 


35:27.562 --> 35:31.000
Would Jehovah actually pardon the city? 


35:33.485 --> 35:35.528
No. 


35:35.528 --> 35:39.000
No, that’s not possible. 


35:40.617 --> 35:44.000
How could Jehovah change his mind? 


35:46.582 --> 35:48.584
What will these people think of me? 


35:48.583 --> 35:53.000
What good is a prophet 
if his words don’t come true? 


35:54.213 --> 35:58.468
Was this not my concern 
when I was in my own land? 


35:58.468 --> 36:00.720
That is why I tried to flee 


36:00.720 --> 36:03.807
to Tarshish in the first place; 


36:03.807 --> 36:07.269
for I knew that you are 
a compassionate and merciful God, 


36:07.268 --> 36:10.480
slow to anger 
and abundant in loyal love, 


36:10.480 --> 36:14.067
and one who feels grieved over calamity. 


36:14.067 --> 36:18.780
O Jehovah, please take away my life, 


36:18.780 --> 36:21.000
for it is better for me to die than to live. 


36:33.087 --> 36:36.000
Is it right for you to be so angry? 


36:38.175 --> 36:41.000
I must leave the city. 


36:42.095 --> 36:44.347
We know you are a prophet of the true God. 


36:44.347 --> 36:46.265
We have faith that you speak truth. 


36:46.265 --> 36:47.600
Please, stay in our home. 


36:47.600 --> 36:48.602
No. 


36:48.602 --> 36:49.602
We will make you comfortable. 


36:49.602 --> 36:52.000
I will not stay in this city. 


37:12.542 --> 37:16.000
Still nothing? 


39:28.720 --> 39:31.000
This plant grew so quickly. 


39:36.268 --> 39:40.000
Jehovah still cares for me. 


41:31.802 --> 41:35.000
O Jehovah, let me die. 


41:37.640 --> 41:40.000
Take my life. 


41:44.688 --> 41:47.525
It is better 


41:47.525 --> 41:50.000
for me to die than to live. 


41:53.573 --> 41:59.000
Is it right for you to be so angry 
over the bottle-gourd plant? 


42:02.623 --> 42:05.210
I have a right to be angry, 


42:05.210 --> 42:08.000
so angry that I want to die. 


42:09.297 --> 42:11.925
You felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant, 


42:11.925 --> 42:14.385
which you did not work for, 


42:14.385 --> 42:16.763
nor did you make it grow; 


42:16.763 --> 42:20.350
it grew in one night 
and perished in one night. 


42:20.350 --> 42:24.937
Should I not also feel sorry 
for Nineveh the great city, 


42:24.937 --> 42:29.525
in which there are more than 120,000 men 


42:29.525 --> 42:32.195
who do not even know right from wrong, 


42:32.195 --> 42:36.000
as well as their many animals? 


43:38.135 --> 43:40.472
Are you Jonah? 


43:40.472 --> 43:41.680
I am. 


43:41.680 --> 43:44.000
Mommy says you saved us. 


43:45.477 --> 43:49.105
No, Jehovah saved you. 


43:49.105 --> 43:53.400
I was just— 


43:53.400 --> 43:55.820
I was just a messenger. 


43:55.820 --> 43:57.000
Thank you. 


44:13.963 --> 44:16.000
What are you doing? 


44:17.050 --> 44:20.470
I’ve written about Nineveh 


44:20.470 --> 44:23.222
but also about Jehovah’s great mercy 


44:23.222 --> 44:26.000
both to the people there and to me. 


44:28.060 --> 44:30.605
Was it hard to write about all that? 


44:30.605 --> 44:32.898
Painful. 


44:32.898 --> 44:36.526
So, what will you do now? 


44:36.527 --> 45:06.412
Whatever Jehovah asks me to do.

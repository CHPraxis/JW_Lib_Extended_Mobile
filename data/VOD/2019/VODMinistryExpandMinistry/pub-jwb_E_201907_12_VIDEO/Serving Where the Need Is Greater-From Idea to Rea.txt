00:00:06 We always admired friends who had sacrificed a lot for Jehovah
00:00:10 and moved to a place
00:00:12 where the need is greater.
00:00:13 And it’s always been our dream
00:00:15 to experience it ourselves.
00:00:19 But at the same time,
00:00:22 we felt that we wouldn’t be able to do something like that.
00:00:24 Even though we had the desire,
00:00:26 we felt that only superhumans
00:00:28 could make that kind of change in their lives.
00:00:31 On JW Broadcasting® of August 2015,
00:00:34 we saw a very encouraging video about the Williams family
00:00:37 and how they moved to Ecuador.
00:00:39 And we thought
00:00:41 that in reality there wasn’t anything standing in our way,
00:00:44 so why couldn’t we do the same?
00:00:49 So we discussed it and decided on a date
00:00:52 —late November 2017—
00:00:54 and then we prayed to Jehovah.
00:01:01 I read the 2016 Yearbook,
00:01:03 and the story about Indonesia
00:01:05 really touched me.
00:01:07 We saw that there is a great need in many Asian countries,
00:01:11 and we thought maybe Thailand.
00:01:18 We wanted to simplify our lives even more, so we moved to a smaller apartment.
00:01:26 At the special convention in Helsinki,
00:01:28 we met a couple who lives in Thailand,
00:01:30 and they gave us a lot of advice
00:01:32 and encouragement.
00:01:37 We wrote a letter where we told a bit
00:01:39 about ourselves and then gave it
00:01:41 to the service committee in our congregation.
00:01:43 They then sent the letter
00:01:45 to the branch in Thailand.
00:01:49 We sold our car, and we also had the opportunity
00:01:53 to move in with Benjamin’s parents.
00:02:22 We received tremendous help from all
00:02:25 in the congregation.
00:02:27 For instance, we needed to find
00:02:29 a place to live,
00:02:31 a car, and to know where to shop for food.
00:02:36 And their love and encouragement has been invaluable.
00:02:47 We received a letter from the Thailand branch
00:02:49 in response to the letter we wrote earlier.
00:02:52 They gave us information
00:02:53 about the living expenses
00:02:55 and some pointers about the culture,
00:02:58 the food, and our spirituality in the new environment.
00:03:01 And we have felt more comfortable
00:03:05 and motivated by knowing
00:03:07 that we have followed the directions from Jehovah.
00:03:10 We have always felt encouraged
00:03:12 by reading experiences about brothers and sisters
00:03:15 who have made sacrifices for Jehovah
00:03:18 and how they have been blessed.
00:03:20 But to experience it for yourself is amazing.
00:03:27 When a problem or an obstacle arose,
00:03:30 Jehovah was there
00:03:32 and ready to help us.
00:03:34 And now we are happy to enjoy the privilege
00:03:37 of serving Jehovah here.

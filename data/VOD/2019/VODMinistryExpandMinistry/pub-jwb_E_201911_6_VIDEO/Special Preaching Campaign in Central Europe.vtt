In the Central Europe branch territory,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special campaign was organized.

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, the School

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:10.906 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for Branch Committee Members and Their Wives

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.701 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
triggered an evaluation of how much territory

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the countries we oversee
is not really covered thoroughly.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we asked our circuit overseers

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recommend to us which sections 

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the congregation’s territory

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be listed
as so-called “unassigned territory.”

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:34.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All in all, we received
over 11,000 territories

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the congregations,
with approximately 3 million inhabitants.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So because of this grand scale,
there was suddenly the idea,

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why not organize
a special preaching campaign

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:48.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to cover all these territories

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on one single weekend?’

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was really exciting.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after getting
the Branch Committee’s approval,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Service Department
started to organize it.

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be honest, at first,
we were not really sure

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the publishers
would react to such a campaign.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we fully trusted in Jehovah,

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the response was stunning.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 20,000 publishers participated

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were assigned
to all these territories throughout Germany.

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The campaign took place
on one weekend in May 2017

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was especially successful
in metropolitan areas,

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as in Berlin, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one door, a man just arrived.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to open his shop
where he sells Arabian specialties.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to show him a video in Arabic.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he gave us his address and phone number.

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also agreed
to have someone visit him again.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s really a privilege
to join in such a campaign

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see that every human
is precious to Jehovah,

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter where they live
or where they come from.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the need
and the fantastic response in 2017,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was decided to repeat
such a campaign in May 2018.

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time it was expanded to Switzerland,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now imagine,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 32,000 publishers participated,

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is actually
over 60 percent more

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than in May 2017.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was really faith-strengthening.

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, again, a lot
of wonderful experiences were reported.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s incredible.

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter where you are in Berlin,

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can see small groups
of brothers everywhere.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was really great.

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:42.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the ministry we met a woman,
and she told us 

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she had just prayed for a Bible study.

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now more than ever convinced

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah leads all this work

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his angels.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Sunday, we had a nice experience.

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A woman called us from behind.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had actually already passed us,

00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had the feeling
she had to go back again

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she told us later.

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After she had invited us to her home,

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we exchanged our contact information

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we also filled in
the online contact form.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Had we been in the territory
just one minute later,

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never have made the contact.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This must have been guided by the angels.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yesterday morning while in the ministry,

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a young man ran after us
and asked us what we were doing.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We explained it to him.

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:36.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked us why there is still
so much evil in the world, then.

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon,
we were able to call on him again.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could start a Bible study right away

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and arrange a return visit,
which we will make today.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being together
with the friends is just so great.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re out and about with a large group.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You meet up again regularly

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to change partners and to relate experiences.

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just great.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thousands of videos were shown,

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a lot of Bible studies were started.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is very interesting
is that a lot of publishers

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:10.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt motivated
to expand their ministry after the campaign.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For sure,
these preaching campaigns truly prove

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah and Jesus
are directing the preaching work.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the angels are helping us
in reaching out to all people.

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we really have a lot of reasons
to be Jehovah’s happy people.

00:00:02 In the Central Europe branch territory,
00:00:05 a special campaign was organized.
00:00:07 Actually, the School
00:00:09 for Branch Committee Members and Their Wives
00:00:10 triggered an evaluation of how much territory
00:00:13 in the countries we oversee is not really covered thoroughly.
00:00:18 So we asked our circuit overseers
00:00:21 to recommend to us which sections
00:00:23 of the congregation’s territory
00:00:25 could be listed as so-called “unassigned territory.”
00:00:29 All in all, we received over 11,000 territories
00:00:34 from the congregations, with approximately 3 million inhabitants.
00:00:38 So because of this grand scale, there was suddenly the idea,
00:00:42 ‘Why not organize a special preaching campaign
00:00:46 ‘to cover all these territories
00:00:48 on one single weekend?’
00:00:51 This was really exciting.
00:00:53 And after getting the Branch Committee’s approval,
00:00:55 the Service Department started to organize it.
00:00:58 To be honest, at first, we were not really sure
00:01:01 how the publishers would react to such a campaign.
00:01:04 But we fully trusted in Jehovah,
00:01:07 and the response was stunning.
00:01:09 Over 20,000 publishers participated
00:01:12 and were assigned to all these territories throughout Germany.
00:01:16 The campaign took place on one weekend in May 2017
00:01:21 and was especially successful in metropolitan areas,
00:01:24 as in Berlin, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf.
00:01:33 At one door, a man just arrived.
00:01:35 He wanted to open his shop where he sells Arabian specialties.
00:01:39 We were able to show him a video in Arabic.
00:01:42 Then he gave us his address and phone number.
00:01:46 He also agreed to have someone visit him again.
00:01:49 Yes, it’s really a privilege to join in such a campaign
00:01:53 and to see that every human is precious to Jehovah,
00:01:55 no matter where they live or where they come from.
00:01:59 Because of the need and the fantastic response in 2017,
00:02:03 it was decided to repeat such a campaign in May 2018.
00:02:08 And this time it was expanded to Switzerland,
00:02:11 Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein.
00:02:14 And now imagine,
00:02:16 over 32,000 publishers participated,
00:02:20 which is actually over 60 percent more
00:02:23 than in May 2017.
00:02:25 This was really faith-strengthening.
00:02:27 And, again, a lot of wonderful experiences were reported.
00:02:32 It’s incredible.
00:02:34 No matter where you are in Berlin,
00:02:36 you can see small groups of brothers everywhere.
00:02:38 That was really great.
00:02:40 In the ministry we met a woman, and she told us
00:02:42 that she had just prayed for a Bible study.
00:02:44 We are now more than ever convinced
00:02:46 that Jehovah leads all this work
00:02:49 through his angels.
00:02:51 Today, Sunday, we had a nice experience.
00:02:55 A woman called us from behind.
00:02:57 She had actually already passed us,
00:02:59 but she had the feeling she had to go back again
00:03:02 —she told us later.
00:03:06 After she had invited us to her home,
00:03:09 we exchanged our contact information
00:03:12 and we also filled in the online contact form.
00:03:17 Had we been in the territory just one minute later,
00:03:19 we would never have made the contact.
00:03:22 This must have been guided by the angels.
00:03:26 Yesterday morning while in the ministry,
00:03:28 a young man ran after us and asked us what we were doing.
00:03:31 We explained it to him.
00:03:32 He asked us why there is still so much evil in the world, then.
00:03:36 In the afternoon, we were able to call on him again.
00:03:38 We could start a Bible study right away
00:03:40 and arrange a return visit, which we will make today.
00:03:45 Being together with the friends is just so great.
00:03:48 You’re out and about with a large group.
00:03:50 You meet up again regularly
00:03:52 to change partners and to relate experiences.
00:03:55 It’s just great.
00:03:58 Thousands of videos were shown,
00:04:00 and a lot of Bible studies were started.
00:04:03 And what is very interesting is that a lot of publishers
00:04:06 felt motivated to expand their ministry after the campaign.
00:04:10 For sure, these preaching campaigns truly prove
00:04:13 that Jehovah and Jesus are directing the preaching work.
00:04:16 And the angels are helping us in reaching out to all people.
00:04:22 Yes, we really have a lot of reasons to be Jehovah’s happy people.

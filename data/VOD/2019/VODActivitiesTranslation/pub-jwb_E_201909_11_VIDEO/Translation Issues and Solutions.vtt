00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:03.219 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to talk about the translation

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:04.921 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our publications,

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a particular aspect

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:08.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of translation I’d like to comment on.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I know
that quite a number of you have moved

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a country
where your mother tongue isn’t spoken

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—either to find work
or to serve where the need is greater.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And others are serving right at home

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:24.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in foreign-language congregations.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, you may have compared
an article in your mother tongue

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:32.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the same article in your second language

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found differences in the translation,

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:37.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you might wonder why that is.

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’d never conclude
that the translators

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:42.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been unfaithful or careless

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they were running
ahead of the organization.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We trust
our hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know there must be
good reasons for the differences,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the purpose of this brief discussion

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:58.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to suggest what some
of those reasons might be.

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:03.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, a word about one
of the principles our translators follow.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re expected not only to render
the thought in the English text accurately

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:12.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to keep in mind
the way people speak.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So accuracy, clarity,

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and naturalness are needed

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while maintaining the dignity of our message.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s involved
in preparing a translation

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:28.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s both accurate and natural?

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not as if the translators
are like the Jewish scribes

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who made copies of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:36.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make sure that the copies they made

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were accurate in every detail,

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would count not only every word

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also every letter
they copied from the source text.

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translation is not like that.

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:51.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not as if there must be
seven words in the target language

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:53.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there are seven words in English.

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:57.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every word in English may not be translated,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the complete thought
of the English has to be there.

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:05.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
English makes effective use of repetition.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:12.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can write one sentence in English
and then repeat the same thought

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:14.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in slightly different words
in the next sentence,

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it sounds fine.

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:18.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in some languages,

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:20.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to repeat a thought
would be viewed as poor writing,

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that wouldn’t reflect well
on our publications.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in such cases,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the translators are allowed to combine

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two sentences into just one sentence

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:35.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as the thought
is completely conveyed.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or they might make two sentences
out of one long English sentence

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that’s more natural in the language.

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can’t always compare
the length of an English paragraph

00:02:47.183 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the length of the paragraph

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the target language and say,

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hey, this paragraph
is shorter than that paragraph.”

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we hear brothers
who have learned a second language say:

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t see why the translators
didn’t follow the English word for word.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,
you can say that in the language.”

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:09.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you may have the words.

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:13.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be possible to “say” that,

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:18.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but would a literal translation
sound strange to native speakers?

00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how well a foreigner
has learned a language,

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
native speakers who speak
the language well

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are usually the best judge
 of what is natural.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty will help foreign speakers
to recognize that.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another thing
that foreign speakers need to be aware of.

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:42.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re vocal
in their criticism of a certain translation,

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would that affect
the confidence of native speakers

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:49.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have to rely on the translation
for their spiritual food?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, nobody is perfect,

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as long as translation
is done by imperfect people,

00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it won’t be perfect.

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:00.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rest assured that our translators

00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take their work very seriously.

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:07.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The subject of translation is complex.

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:09.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m surely no expert.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear from some brothers
who have worked in the field for many years

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:15.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what we can learn.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet Nick Ahladis,

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nick Exarcheas,

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:23.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Saki Marais.

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:26.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we have just heard,

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goal of translators is to convey ideas

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accurately, naturally, and clearly.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t an easy thing to do.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:40.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss
a few of the challenges of translation.

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:42.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will focus on three areas

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:46.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see why translators
make the choices they do:

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible expressions,

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrations,

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and vocabulary.

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first point is Bible expressions.

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:00.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nick, could you please tell us

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why translating some expressions in the Bible

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:06.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be very challenging?

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, before our brothers and sisters

00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive the New World Translation
in their language,

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have to use Bibles
produced by Christendom.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, these Bibles
contain false religious ideas

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and terms that reflect those ideas.

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:25.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we produce the New World Translation, 

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great care has to be taken

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:31.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow such terms
to distort our translation.

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:35.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you give us an example of an expression

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:39.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was translated the wrong way

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bibles produced by Christendom?

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one example is the term “holy spirit.”

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many Bibles produced by Christendom,

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:53.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the term gives the idea
of a spirit creature in heaven,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even a “holy ghost,”
sometimes even a “holy demon.”

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That must be very confusing to the readers.

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can the translators do about that?

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many languages,
our translators have found

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the closest way
to translate “holy spirit”

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to say “holy power” or “holy force.”

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:15.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This may sound very different,

00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:18.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it conveys the same idea.

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even the English New World Translation

00:06:20.263 --> 00:06:22.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes the term “holy spirit”

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “God’s active force” at Genesis 1:2,

00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:29.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while other English translations
say “God’s holy spirit.”

00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:30.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now the brothers
can use an expression

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:37.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is understood
by the field and the audience.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it must be a wonderful thing
to have the New World Translation.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s a wonderful thing.

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:47.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, the brothers
have to get used to the new terms.

00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that they’ve been using

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the original terms
in their local Bibles for years

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:55.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach people the truth.

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as they get used to the new terminology

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their personal study,
at meetings, and in the ministry,

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they begin to see
the benefits of the new terms,

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:09.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and afterward they really embrace
the New World Translation.

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:10.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us go to the second challenge,

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrations.

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:16.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are illustrations

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly difficult to translate?

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An illustration that works in one culture
might not work in another.

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:27.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Illustrations are only effective
if the reader can relate to them.

00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why Jesus used illustrations

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on everyday things
that his audience was familiar with,

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as farming, building, fishing.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, our publications

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also use illustrations 
that people can relate to.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember an article
that discussed the need

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to be patient in difficult situations.

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it used the illustration
of a driver who is stuck in traffic.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one translation team
wrote to the Translator Help Desk,

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they explained that most of their readers

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not familiar with traffic jams.

00:07:56.826 --> 00:07:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For someone who lives in a big city,

00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sounds unbelievable, but it’s true.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the team wanted to use
a different illustration.

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:08.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are familiar with the idea
of people standing in long lines,

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
waiting for their maize, or corn,
to be ground at the milling machine.

00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:13.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this illustration was approved

00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it would help
their readers to get the point:

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to be patient.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these are
completely different illustrations,

00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the point
—or the message—

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the same, for example,
then, about being patient.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we read in our language edition

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:32.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of The Watchtower or other publication

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a different illustration
than the one we read in English,

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:40.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be confident
that the translators received approval

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make this adjustment
so that the right message is conveyed.

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:46.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was very helpful.
Thank you.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:48.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us go to our third challenge

00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:50.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that of vocabulary,

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is,
the words that are used in a language.

00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:58.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we might assume
that for every important word

00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our language

00:09:00.156 --> 00:09:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there will be an exact equivalent 

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in another language.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, translation
is much more complicated than that.

00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:10.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take, for example, the word “peace.”

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years back,

00:09:12.268 --> 00:09:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a convention about godly peace.

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:19.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one might think,
‘Well, that’s an easy word to translate.’

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that word was used about 350 times

00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:25.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in talks on the convention

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes referring to peace
between God and man,

00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:32.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes referring to peace
in family or with our neighbors,

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:35.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other times
referring to peace of mind.

00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:38.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in some languages,
there’s simply no way

00:09:38.394 --> 00:09:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use just one word
to convey all those aspects of peace

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:46.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have one word
for the kind of peace that God gives,

00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:51.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a different word for when there’s no war
in a country (that kind of peace),

00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a different word to indicate that people

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are getting along with one another.

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those translators
need to understand the point

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of each usage in the context

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:05.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then convey
the right translation accordingly.

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:09.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it opens our minds
to how wonderfully Jehovah made us,

00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the capacity to think and feel

00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have many concepts and ideas

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have the ability
to express them in our language

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in words—
to use words for that.

00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we express them
in so many different ways.

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:26.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s so true.

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every language has its own vocabulary
and way of expressing things.

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:33.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I find very interesting
is how other languages

00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
render standard expressions
that we use as Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:40.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
“field service,” “circuit overseer,”

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:42.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Kingdom Hall,” “special pioneer”

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those expressions
were first used in English,

00:10:45.294 --> 00:10:47.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then translators
had to come up with equivalents

00:10:47.963 --> 00:10:50.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their languages
so that it would make sense.

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:52.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that wouldn’t be difficult
—would it?—

00:10:52.468 --> 00:10:54.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because for the word “kingdom”

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely we have
another word in another language,

00:10:57.206 --> 00:11:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the word “hall”
we have an equivalent word.

00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:02.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all you have to do
is put the two words together

00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to translate “Kingdom Hall.”

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have the words,

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a literal translation of “Kingdom Hall”

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could mean something totally different.

00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some countries still have a king.

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:16.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those places,
this “Kingdom Hall” could mean

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“government office,” or it could mean

00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:22.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“hall belonging to the kingdom
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:11:22.498 --> 00:11:24.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that would be totally misleading.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why the Governing Body
has given approval to say

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “Meeting Place of Jehovah’s Witnesses”

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the “Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:37.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the expressions
sound a little bit different,

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basic intent is the same,
and people get the right idea.

00:11:41.217 --> 00:11:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it is obvious
that the challenges of translation are huge.

00:11:46.222 --> 00:11:47.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is,

00:11:47.523 --> 00:11:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can a newly formed translation team

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:54.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or one in a very remote location

00:11:54.096 --> 00:11:57.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have the confidence
and have the assurance

00:11:57.266 --> 00:12:01.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they produce
the highest standard possible?

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, all translation teams,
regardless of size or location,

00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefit from regular communication

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Writing Committee
of the Governing Body.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:12.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we understand that the Governing Body

00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:15.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directs matters from headquarters,

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do they really know
what the translators are doing?

00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:22.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,
the Writing Committee trusts the translators,

00:12:22.224 --> 00:12:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at the same time,
they don’t try to micromanage their work.

00:12:26.262 --> 00:12:30.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they have done
is set in place training programs

00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach translators
basic translation principles

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them to understand
how to apply those principles

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:39.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when translating the publications.

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this ensures that the same message

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:45.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being conveyed regardless of language.

00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:49.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they’re not sure that their solution

00:12:49.952 --> 00:12:52.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is exactly right on target,

00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:54.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can write to the Writing Committee

00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:59.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for direction
to inquire whether this solution

00:12:59.094 --> 00:13:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveys the right idea in the context.

00:13:01.664 --> 00:13:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the Writing Committee answers

00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds of translation questions every week

00:13:06.602 --> 00:13:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as part of the ongoing training of the teams.

00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:11.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the translators
have access to these answers

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can learn from one another

00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to solve problems
that are delicate and difficult.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This effective communication system

00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:23.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really helps to unify
the thinking of all the translators

00:13:23.352 --> 00:13:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make sure
that they all produce the same message.

00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:29.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that unifies
the thinking of the worldwide field.

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much
for explaining those factors

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affecting translation,

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is impressive

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has an arrangement in place

00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:44.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reverses the effect of Babel.

00:13:45.508 --> 00:13:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is also so wonderful
that by means of his holy spirit,

00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah unifies his people around the earth

00:13:54.383 --> 00:13:57.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of what language they use.

00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, brothers.

00:14:00.122 --> 00:14:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve given us an even deeper appreciation

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of the work involved
in making a quality translation.

00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:07.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot.

00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:09.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure our audience did too.

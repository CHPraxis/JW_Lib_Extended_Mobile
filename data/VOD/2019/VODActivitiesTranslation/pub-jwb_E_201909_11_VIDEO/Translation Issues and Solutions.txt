00:00:01 I’d like to talk about the translation
00:00:03 of our publications,
00:00:04 and there’s a particular aspect
00:00:06 of translation I’d like to comment on.
00:00:09 Now, I know that quite a number of you have moved
00:00:12 to a country where your mother tongue isn’t spoken
00:00:15 —either to find work or to serve where the need is greater.
00:00:18 And others are serving right at home
00:00:21 but in foreign-language congregations.
00:00:25 At times, you may have compared an article in your mother tongue
00:00:29 with the same article in your second language
00:00:32 and found differences in the translation,
00:00:34 and you might wonder why that is.
00:00:37 Well, we’d never conclude that the translators
00:00:39 had been unfaithful or careless
00:00:42 or that they were running ahead of the organization.
00:00:45 No.
00:00:46 We trust our hardworking brothers and sisters.
00:00:49 So we know there must be good reasons for the differences,
00:00:53 and the purpose of this brief discussion
00:00:55 is to suggest what some of those reasons might be.
00:00:58 First, a word about one of the principles our translators follow.
00:01:03 They’re expected not only to render the thought in the English text accurately
00:01:08 but also to keep in mind the way people speak.
00:01:12 So accuracy, clarity,
00:01:15 and naturalness are needed
00:01:17 while maintaining the dignity of our message.
00:01:21 Now, what’s involved in preparing a translation
00:01:24 that’s both accurate and natural?
00:01:28 It’s not as if the translators are like the Jewish scribes
00:01:31 who made copies of the Hebrew Scriptures.
00:01:34 To make sure that the copies they made
00:01:36 were accurate in every detail,
00:01:38 they would count not only every word
00:01:41 but also every letter they copied from the source text.
00:01:45 Translation is not like that.
00:01:48 It’s not as if there must be seven words in the target language
00:01:51 if there are seven words in English.
00:01:53 Every word in English may not be translated,
00:01:57 but the complete thought of the English has to be there.
00:02:01 English makes effective use of repetition.
00:02:05 What do we mean by that?
00:02:07 Well, you can write one sentence in English and then repeat the same thought
00:02:12 in slightly different words in the next sentence,
00:02:14 and it sounds fine.
00:02:16 But in some languages,
00:02:18 to repeat a thought would be viewed as poor writing,
00:02:20 and that wouldn’t reflect well on our publications.
00:02:24 So in such cases,
00:02:26 the translators are allowed to combine
00:02:29 two sentences into just one sentence
00:02:32 as long as the thought is completely conveyed.
00:02:35 Or they might make two sentences out of one long English sentence
00:02:40 if that’s more natural in the language.
00:02:42 So you can’t always compare the length of an English paragraph
00:02:47 with the length of the paragraph
00:02:49 in the target language and say,
00:02:51 “Hey, this paragraph is shorter than that paragraph.”
00:02:55 Sometimes we hear brothers who have learned a second language say:
00:02:59 “I don’t see why the translators didn’t follow the English word for word.
00:03:03 After all, you can say that in the language.”
00:03:07 Well, you may have the words.
00:03:09 It may be possible to “say” that,
00:03:13 but would a literal translation sound strange to native speakers?
00:03:18 No matter how well a foreigner has learned a language,
00:03:21 native speakers who speak the language well
00:03:25 are usually the best judge  of what is natural.
00:03:28 Modesty will help foreign speakers to recognize that.
00:03:34 There’s another thing that foreign speakers need to be aware of.
00:03:38 If they’re vocal in their criticism of a certain translation,
00:03:42 how would that affect the confidence of native speakers
00:03:45 who have to rely on the translation for their spiritual food?
00:03:50 Of course, nobody is perfect,
00:03:52 and as long as translation is done by imperfect people,
00:03:56 it won’t be perfect.
00:03:58 But rest assured that our translators
00:04:00 take their work very seriously.
00:04:05 The subject of translation is complex.
00:04:07 And I’m surely no expert.
00:04:09 Let’s hear from some brothers who have worked in the field for many years
00:04:13 and see what we can learn.
00:04:15 Meet Nick Ahladis,
00:04:18 Nick Exarcheas,
00:04:21 and Saki Marais.
00:04:24 As we have just heard,
00:04:26 the goal of translators is to convey ideas
00:04:29 accurately, naturally, and clearly.
00:04:33 This isn’t an easy thing to do.
00:04:36 Let’s discuss a few of the challenges of translation.
00:04:40 We will focus on three areas
00:04:42 and see why translators make the choices they do:
00:04:47 Bible expressions,
00:04:49 illustrations,
00:04:51 and vocabulary.
00:04:53 So our first point is Bible expressions.
00:04:57 Nick, could you please tell us
00:05:00 why translating some expressions in the Bible
00:05:04 can be very challenging?
00:05:06 Well, before our brothers and sisters
00:05:08 receive the New World Translation in their language,
00:05:12 they have to use Bibles produced by Christendom.
00:05:15 Often, these Bibles contain false religious ideas
00:05:19 and terms that reflect those ideas.
00:05:22 So when we produce the New World Translation,
00:05:25 great care has to be taken
00:05:27 not to allow such terms to distort our translation.
00:05:31 Can you give us an example of an expression
00:05:35 that was translated the wrong way
00:05:39 in the Bibles produced by Christendom?
00:05:41 Well, one example is the term “holy spirit.”
00:05:45 In many Bibles produced by Christendom,
00:05:48 the term gives the idea of a spirit creature in heaven,
00:05:54 even a “holy ghost,” sometimes even a “holy demon.”
00:05:58 That must be very confusing to the readers.
00:06:02 But what can the translators do about that?
00:06:05 In many languages, our translators have found
00:06:07 that the closest way to translate “holy spirit”
00:06:09 is to say “holy power” or “holy force.”
00:06:13 This may sound very different,
00:06:15 but it conveys the same idea.
00:06:18 And even the English New World Translation
00:06:20 describes the term “holy spirit”
00:06:22 as “God’s active force” at Genesis 1:2,
00:06:25 while other English translations say “God’s holy spirit.”
00:06:29 Good.
00:06:30 So now the brothers can use an expression
00:06:33 that is understood by the field and the audience.
00:06:37 But it must be a wonderful thing to have the New World Translation.
00:06:41 Yes, it’s a wonderful thing.
00:06:43 But still, the brothers have to get used to the new terms.
00:06:47 Remember that they’ve been using
00:06:49 the original terms in their local Bibles for years
00:06:53 to teach people the truth.
00:06:55 But as they get used to the new terminology
00:06:58 in their personal study, at meetings, and in the ministry,
00:07:02 they begin to see the benefits of the new terms,
00:07:05 and afterward they really embrace the New World Translation.
00:07:09 Thank you.
00:07:10 Now let us go to the second challenge,
00:07:12 illustrations.
00:07:14 Why are illustrations
00:07:16 particularly difficult to translate?
00:07:20 An illustration that works in one culture might not work in another.
00:07:23 Illustrations are only effective if the reader can relate to them.
00:07:27 And that’s why Jesus used illustrations
00:07:29 based on everyday things that his audience was familiar with,
00:07:32 such as farming, building, fishing.
00:07:35 And today, our publications
00:07:37 also use illustrations  that people can relate to.
00:07:40 I remember an article that discussed the need
00:07:42 for us to be patient in difficult situations.
00:07:46 And it used the illustration of a driver who is stuck in traffic.
00:07:49 Now, one translation team wrote to the Translator Help Desk,
00:07:52 and they explained that most of their readers
00:07:54 were not familiar with traffic jams.
00:07:56 For someone who lives in a big city,
00:07:58 that sounds unbelievable, but it’s true.
00:08:01 So the team wanted to use a different illustration.
00:08:04 They are familiar with the idea of people standing in long lines,
00:08:08 waiting for their maize, or corn, to be ground at the milling machine.
00:08:11 And this illustration was approved
00:08:13 because it would help their readers to get the point:
00:08:16 They need to be patient.
00:08:18 Now, these are completely different illustrations,
00:08:21 but the point —or the message—
00:08:23 is the same, for example, then, about being patient.
00:08:26 Now, when we read in our language edition
00:08:30 of The Watchtower or other publication
00:08:32 a different illustration than the one we read in English,
00:08:36 we can be confident that the translators received approval
00:08:40 to make this adjustment so that the right message is conveyed.
00:08:43 Well, that was very helpful. Thank you.
00:08:46 Now let us go to our third challenge
00:08:48 —that of vocabulary,
00:08:50 that is, the words that are used in a language.
00:08:55 Now, we might assume that for every important word
00:08:58 in our language
00:09:00 there will be an exact equivalent
00:09:02 in another language.
00:09:04 Well, translation is much more complicated than that.
00:09:07 Take, for example, the word “peace.”
00:09:10 Some years back,
00:09:12 we had a convention about godly peace.
00:09:15 And one might think, ‘Well, that’s an easy word to translate.’
00:09:19 But that word was used about 350 times
00:09:22 in talks on the convention
00:09:25 —sometimes referring to peace between God and man,
00:09:28 sometimes referring to peace in family or with our neighbors,
00:09:32 and other times referring to peace of mind.
00:09:35 Now, in some languages, there’s simply no way
00:09:38 to use just one word to convey all those aspects of peace
00:09:42 because they have one word for the kind of peace that God gives,
00:09:46 a different word for when there’s no war in a country (that kind of peace),
00:09:51 and a different word to indicate that people
00:09:54 are getting along with one another.
00:09:56 So those translators need to understand the point
00:09:59 of each usage in the context
00:10:02 and then convey the right translation accordingly.
00:10:06 Now it opens our minds to how wonderfully Jehovah made us,
00:10:09 with the capacity to think and feel
00:10:12 and have many concepts and ideas
00:10:14 and to have the ability to express them in our language
00:10:19 —in words— to use words for that.
00:10:22 But we express them in so many different ways.
00:10:25 Yes, it’s so true.
00:10:26 Every language has its own vocabulary and way of expressing things.
00:10:30 What I find very interesting is how other languages
00:10:33 render standard expressions that we use as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:10:36 For example, “field service,” “circuit overseer,”
00:10:40 “Kingdom Hall,” “special pioneer”
00:10:42 —those expressions were first used in English,
00:10:45 and then translators had to come up with equivalents
00:10:47 in their languages so that it would make sense.
00:10:50 But that wouldn’t be difficult —would it?—
00:10:52 because for the word “kingdom”
00:10:54 surely we have another word in another language,
00:10:57 and for the word “hall” we have an equivalent word.
00:11:00 And all you have to do is put the two words together
00:11:02 to translate “Kingdom Hall.”
00:11:04 They may have the words,
00:11:06 but a literal translation of “Kingdom Hall”
00:11:08 could mean something totally different.
00:11:11 Now, some countries still have a king.
00:11:13 In those places, this “Kingdom Hall” could mean
00:11:16 “government office,” or it could mean
00:11:19 “hall belonging to the kingdom of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:11:22 So that would be totally misleading.
00:11:24 And that’s why the Governing Body has given approval to say
00:11:28 the “Meeting Place of Jehovah’s Witnesses”
00:11:30 or the “Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:11:33 Even though the expressions sound a little bit different,
00:11:37 the basic intent is the same, and people get the right idea.
00:11:41 So it is obvious that the challenges of translation are huge.
00:11:46 But now the question is,
00:11:47 How can a newly formed translation team
00:11:50 or one in a very remote location
00:11:54 have the confidence and have the assurance
00:11:57 that they produce the highest standard possible?
00:12:01 Well, all translation teams, regardless of size or location,
00:12:05 benefit from regular communication
00:12:07 with the Writing Committee of the Governing Body.
00:12:10 Well, we understand that the Governing Body
00:12:12 directs matters from headquarters,
00:12:15 but do they really know what the translators are doing?
00:12:19 Well, the Writing Committee trusts the translators,
00:12:22 but at the same time, they don’t try to micromanage their work.
00:12:26 What they have done is set in place training programs
00:12:30 to teach translators basic translation principles
00:12:33 to help them to understand how to apply those principles
00:12:37 when translating the publications.
00:12:39 And this ensures that the same message
00:12:42 is being conveyed regardless of language.
00:12:45 And when they’re not sure that their solution
00:12:49 is exactly right on target,
00:12:52 they can write to the Writing Committee
00:12:54 and ask for direction to inquire whether this solution
00:12:59 conveys the right idea in the context.
00:13:01 Also, the Writing Committee answers
00:13:03 hundreds of translation questions every week
00:13:06 as part of the ongoing training of the teams.
00:13:09 All of the translators have access to these answers
00:13:11 so that they can learn from one another
00:13:13 how to solve problems that are delicate and difficult.
00:13:16 This effective communication system
00:13:19 really helps to unify the thinking of all the translators
00:13:23 and to make sure that they all produce the same message.
00:13:26 And that unifies the thinking of the worldwide field.
00:13:29 Well, thank you very much for explaining those factors
00:13:34 affecting translation,
00:13:36 and it is impressive
00:13:38 that Jehovah has an arrangement in place
00:13:40 that reverses the effect of Babel.
00:13:45 And it is also so wonderful that by means of his holy spirit,
00:13:50 Jehovah unifies his people around the earth
00:13:54 regardless of what language they use.
00:13:57 Thanks, brothers.
00:14:00 You’ve given us an even deeper appreciation
00:14:02 for all of the work involved in making a quality translation.
00:14:05 I learned a lot.
00:14:07 I’m sure our audience did too.

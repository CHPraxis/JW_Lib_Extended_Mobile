00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we were going home,

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everyone wanted to go to another gathering.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told them I had service plans the next morning.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was hoping to get this new Bible study going,

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I needed some time to prepare.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t go over so well.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They started pressuring me, saying:

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, what if he’s not there?”

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yeah, why go through all that work for nothing?”

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It kept getting worse.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just skip it,” they said.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come on, Tyler.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t make us drive you all the way home first

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just come.”

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was against me.

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I remembered a family worship.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We studied about Caleb.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What gave him the courage to be different?

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is with us,” he said.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:12.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helped me to remember
that Jehovah is with me too.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told them that the gathering sounded really fun,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if it meant missing my Bible study,

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wasn’t worth it.

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told them I would find my own ride home.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was going fine

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until Mr. Craig started talking about evolution.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“The wide variations

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of living things on earth
are the result of the evolutionary process.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:52.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All living creatures, including us,

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
descended from a common ancestor.”

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the class agreed with him,

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the other Witnesses chose to stay quiet.

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to speak up like Tyler did,

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was scared to.

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:15.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I remembered my Bible study.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last week, we studied about Jael.

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She probably felt scared too
when facing the terrifying Sisera.

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:27.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she used the tools she had
to come to the assistance of Jehovah,

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he blessed her for it.

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me think,

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:34.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What tools do I have?’

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think there are good reasons

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to believe that God
designed all living things.

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:42.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My phone contains a lot of information

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my contacts, notes, e-mails, pictures.

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it didn’t come that way.

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I put it there.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just a phone.

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the information for this plant?

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did it come from?

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:59.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really glad I took a stand,

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:04.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it even led to a good witness.

00:03:18.302 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, after school,
I saw Tomiko give a good witness.

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She even started a Bible study.

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:33.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not everyone was a fan,

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially these kids.

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They saw me out preaching last week.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They started saying things like:
“No one wants to read your garbage!

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:44.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you always push your ideas on people?

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your parents force you?”

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that point, I would have given
almost anything for them to leave me alone.

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But last week, we studied
about the prophet Micaiah at family worship.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:01.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have easily lied to the king,

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead he spoke the truth,
and he made Jehovah’s heart proud.

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:10.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to make Jehovah’s heart proud too.

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:13.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I told them: “You want the truth?

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one forces me to preach;

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do it because I want to.

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s Witnesses love people,

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to share
with them good news from the Bible.”

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them said that I gave the wrong answer.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t think so.

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kevin and I were having a great morning.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:49.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met a lot of nice people.

00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:53.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we saw those same kids from school.

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kevin said that we should just leave

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we didn’t need any trouble.

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that point,
I could feel my palms starting to sweat.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I’d have to face them again.

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:11.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I thought about Jeremiah.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recently did some personal study on him.

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:18.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when threatened, 
he bravely told his opposers:

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am in your hand.”

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He stayed the course!

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:28.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to stay the course.

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:35.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said, “We told you
to stop forcing your stupid ideas on people.”

00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:41.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I told them I wasn’t going anywhere.

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he just laughed and said I wasn’t worth it.

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:16.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My boss called me into his office,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he offered me a promotion
to a full-time position,

00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:22.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would mean a lot more money.

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:25.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in a meeting at work,

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:30.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they told me how much
they appreciate me and my good work ethic.

00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:32.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then suddenly they offered me

00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this full scholarship to start pursuing a career.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My uncle told me he’d back me financially
if I ever wanted to stop working for him

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:46.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and start my own construction business.

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:51.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few weeks later,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother was giving a talk at our circuit assembly.

00:06:54.643 --> 00:06:59.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He read Mark 10:21,
where Jesus told the rich young ruler:

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One thing is missing about you:

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:04.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, sell what things you have
and give to the poor,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will have treasure in heaven;
and come be my follower.”

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:11.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he made the point:

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:14.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of grabbing
on to a rich spiritual opportunity,

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:16.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that young ruler just let it slide by.

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he asked us,
“Is ‘one thing missing’ from your life?”

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:23.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was right.

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:25.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something was missing.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:30.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m baptized,
but am I really giving Jehovah my all?

00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:34.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could I do it?
Could I do more?

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:42.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was determined not to let a spiritual opportunity,

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
like full-time service, pass me by.

00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:50.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need courage not only when things are bad.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But you also need it to pursue

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.121 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a life of self-sacrifice.

00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:59.583 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And when you do,
you’ll have no regrets

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:03.253 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because nothing
will ever be missing from your life.

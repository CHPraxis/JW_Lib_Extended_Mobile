00:00:10 I thought we were going home,
00:00:12 but everyone wanted to go to another gathering.
00:00:16 I told them I had service plans the next morning.
00:00:20 I was hoping to get this new Bible study going,
00:00:22 and I needed some time to prepare.
00:00:25 It didn’t go over so well.
00:00:27 They started pressuring me, saying:
00:00:30 “Well, what if he’s not there?”
00:00:32 “Yeah, why go through all that work for nothing?”
00:00:36 It kept getting worse.
00:00:39 “Just skip it,” they said.
00:00:41 “Come on, Tyler.
00:00:42 “Don’t make us drive you all the way home first
00:00:44 —just come.”
00:00:48 Everyone was against me.
00:00:50 I didn’t know what to do.
00:00:54 But then I remembered a family worship.
00:00:57 We studied about Caleb.
00:00:59 What gave him the courage to be different?
00:01:02 “Jehovah is with us,” he said.
00:01:08 That helped me to remember that Jehovah is with me too.
00:01:14 I told them that the gathering sounded really fun,
00:01:18 but if it meant missing my Bible study,
00:01:20 it wasn’t worth it.
00:01:23 I told them I would find my own ride home.
00:01:36 Everything was going fine
00:01:38 until Mr. Craig started talking about evolution.
00:01:43 He said: “The wide variations
00:01:46 “of living things on earth are the result of the evolutionary process.
00:01:50 “All living creatures, including us,
00:01:52 descended from a common ancestor.”
00:01:55 Most of the class agreed with him,
00:01:58 but the other Witnesses chose to stay quiet.
00:02:03 I wanted to speak up like Tyler did,
00:02:09 but I was scared to.
00:02:13 But then I remembered my Bible study.
00:02:15 Last week, we studied about Jael.
00:02:18 She probably felt scared too when facing the terrifying Sisera.
00:02:23 But she used the tools she had to come to the assistance of Jehovah,
00:02:27 and he blessed her for it.
00:02:30 It made me think,
00:02:32 ‘What tools do I have?’
00:02:34 I think there are good reasons
00:02:36 to believe that God designed all living things.
00:02:39 My phone contains a lot of information
00:02:42 —my contacts, notes, e-mails, pictures.
00:02:46 But it didn’t come that way.
00:02:48 I put it there.
00:02:50 That’s just a phone.
00:02:52 What about the information for this plant?
00:02:54 Where did it come from?
00:02:57 I’m really glad I took a stand,
00:03:00 and it even led to a good witness.
00:03:18 Recently, after school, I saw Tomiko give a good witness.
00:03:22 She even started a Bible study.
00:03:30 But not everyone was a fan,
00:03:33 especially these kids.
00:03:35 They saw me out preaching last week.
00:03:38 They started saying things like: “No one wants to read your garbage!
00:03:42 “Why do you always push your ideas on people?
00:03:44 Do your parents force you?”
00:03:48 At that point, I would have given almost anything for them to leave me alone.
00:03:54 But last week, we studied about the prophet Micaiah at family worship.
00:03:58 He could have easily lied to the king,
00:04:01 but instead he spoke the truth, and he made Jehovah’s heart proud.
00:04:06 I wanted to make Jehovah’s heart proud too.
00:04:10 Then I told them: “You want the truth?
00:04:13 “No one forces me to preach;
00:04:15 “I do it because I want to.
00:04:17 “Jehovah’s Witnesses love people,
00:04:20 and we want to share with them good news from the Bible.”
00:04:27 One of them said that I gave the wrong answer.
00:04:30 But I didn’t think so.
00:04:41 Kevin and I were having a great morning.
00:04:45 We met a lot of nice people.
00:04:49 But then we saw those same kids from school.
00:04:54 Kevin said that we should just leave
00:04:57 and that we didn’t need any trouble.
00:05:00 At that point, I could feel my palms starting to sweat.
00:05:05 But I knew I’d have to face them again.
00:05:08 Then I thought about Jeremiah.
00:05:11 I recently did some personal study on him.
00:05:14 And when threatened,  he bravely told his opposers:
00:05:18 “I am in your hand.”
00:05:20 He stayed the course!
00:05:24 I wanted to stay the course.
00:05:30 They said, “We told you to stop forcing your stupid ideas on people.”
00:05:37 But I told them I wasn’t going anywhere.
00:05:49 Then he just laughed and said I wasn’t worth it.
00:06:12 My boss called me into his office,
00:06:16 and he offered me a promotion to a full-time position,
00:06:19 which would mean a lot more money.
00:06:23 I was in a meeting at work,
00:06:25 and they told me how much they appreciate me and my good work ethic.
00:06:30 And then suddenly they offered me
00:06:32 this full scholarship to start pursuing a career.
00:06:40 My uncle told me he’d back me financially if I ever wanted to stop working for him
00:06:43 and start my own construction business.
00:06:49 A few weeks later,
00:06:51 a brother was giving a talk at our circuit assembly.
00:06:54 He read Mark 10:21, where Jesus told the rich young ruler:
00:06:59 “One thing is missing about you:
00:07:01 “Go, sell what things you have and give to the poor,
00:07:04 and you will have treasure in heaven; and come be my follower.”
00:07:09 Then he made the point:
00:07:11 Instead of grabbing on to a rich spiritual opportunity,
00:07:14 that young ruler just let it slide by.
00:07:17 Then he asked us, “Is ‘one thing missing’ from your life?”
00:07:21 He was right.
00:07:23 Something was missing.
00:07:26 I’m baptized, but am I really giving Jehovah my all?
00:07:31 Could I do it? Could I do more?
00:07:38 I was determined not to let a spiritual opportunity,
00:07:42 like full-time service, pass me by.
00:07:47 You need courage not only when things are bad.
00:07:50 But you also need it to pursue
00:07:53 a life of self-sacrifice.
00:07:56 And when you do, you’ll have no regrets
00:07:59 because nothing will ever be missing from your life.

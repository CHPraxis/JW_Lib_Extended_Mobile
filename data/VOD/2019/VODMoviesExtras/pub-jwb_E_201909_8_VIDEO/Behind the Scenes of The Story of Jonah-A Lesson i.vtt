Have you ever been given an assignment

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:16.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that seemed overwhelming?

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:19.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah experienced self-doubt and fear

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was told to warn the Ninevites

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their impending destruction.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he learned to trust in Jehovah,

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he received the courage
and the wisdom to do the work.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:34.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just 40 days more,

00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nineveh will be overthrown!

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah never imagined his experience

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be portrayed in a film

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant to encourage millions
of people in our day.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The volunteers who made this movie

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had their own Jonahlike challenges.

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the storm,
the big fish, and the city of Nineveh

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these elements were unlike anything

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Audio/Video Services Department

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had ever filmed.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Careful planning and full reliance
on Jehovah would be required

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to portray these accurately
and within budget.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The cast received specialized training

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn their lines and portray
the proper emotions for each scene.

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sets were carefully
researched and designed,

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with set construction taking place
at various Bethel facilities

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as in Southern California.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Costumes accurate to the time period
and region were designed,

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makeup was also researched

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey the appropriate styles of the era.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In early 2017,

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filming began at Mount Ebo.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:50.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He claims Jehovah sent a fish to swallow him.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you sleeping?

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get up, call out to your god!

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:05.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, production moved
to Southern California

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where brothers and sisters
from local congregations

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided meals, tents,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vehicles, housing,
and most other logistical needs.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The outpouring of enthusiastic support

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a clear demonstration
of their love for Jehovah

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his people.

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it was time to create 
the boat sequences, production moved

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:27.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Louisiana

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make use
of a large water tank located there.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remote volunteers assisted
with the preparation of the tank

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as labor and materials
needed to construct the boat.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, they provided
rescue-diver support and meals for the crew.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A non-Witness consultant

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had some interesting observations
on what he saw.

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a certain peace about this place.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Prayer in the morning is good.

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:00.367 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it works.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:03.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no politics on set.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a mission and a goal set for the day.

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s well explained.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like a family.

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Producers and directors
would be rather jealous

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s a well-run, tidy operation.

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Production finally ended back

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:20.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Watchtower Educational Center
in Patterson

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a large outdoor set
designed to replicate several streets

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a courtyard of Nineveh.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once principal shooting was completed,

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visual effects needed to be added
to create realistic environments

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would make
the story even more immersive.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add to that hundreds of hours

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:09.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spent in the editing rooms,
stitching the pieces together

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create a cohesive story.

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:13.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still more work was needed.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought you wouldn’t be back.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so sorry, Joanna.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:18.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Music had to be composed

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sound effects added.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah! Jonah!

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah, look!

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got figs!

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:32.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David said at Psalm 40:1-3:

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I earnestly hoped in Jehovah . . .

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He made my footing secure. . . .

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many will look on in awe
and put their trust in Jehovah.”

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:43.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The volunteers who worked

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Jonah drama
found David’s words to be true.

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to just some of the expressions
of appreciation from viewers.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you for all of your hard work.

00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We laughed and cried
and sat on the edge of our seats,

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the lessons
hit home for each of us.”

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I tried to imagine how to be courageous
and boldly preach like Jonah.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I no longer felt fear.”

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:10.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much like Jonah, the cast and crew
involved in the making of this film

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were reminded continuously

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter
how challenging the assignment,

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will help us face it.

00:00:11 Have you ever been given an assignment
00:00:13 that seemed overwhelming?
00:00:16 Jonah experienced self-doubt and fear
00:00:19 when he was told to warn the Ninevites
00:00:21 of their impending destruction.
00:00:25 But he learned to trust in Jehovah,
00:00:27 and he received the courage and the wisdom to do the work.
00:00:30 In just 40 days more,
00:00:34 Nineveh will be overthrown!
00:00:38 Jonah never imagined his experience
00:00:41 would be portrayed in a film
00:00:44 meant to encourage millions of people in our day.
00:00:47 The volunteers who made this movie
00:00:50 had their own Jonahlike challenges.
00:00:54 For example, the storm, the big fish, and the city of Nineveh
00:00:58 —these elements were unlike anything
00:01:00 that the Audio/Video Services Department
00:01:03 had ever filmed.
00:01:05 Careful planning and full reliance on Jehovah would be required
00:01:09 to portray these accurately and within budget.
00:01:11 The cast received specialized training
00:01:14 to learn their lines and portray the proper emotions for each scene.
00:01:20 The sets were carefully researched and designed,
00:01:23 with set construction taking place at various Bethel facilities
00:01:27 as well as in Southern California.
00:01:30 Costumes accurate to the time period and region were designed,
00:01:34 and makeup was also researched
00:01:36 to convey the appropriate styles of the era.
00:01:42 In early 2017,
00:01:44 filming began at Mount Ebo.
00:01:47 He claims Jehovah sent a fish to swallow him.
00:01:53 Why are you sleeping?
00:01:55 Get up, call out to your god!
00:02:02 Later, production moved to Southern California
00:02:05 where brothers and sisters from local congregations
00:02:07 provided meals, tents,
00:02:10 vehicles, housing, and most other logistical needs.
00:02:14 The outpouring of enthusiastic support
00:02:16 was a clear demonstration of their love for Jehovah
00:02:20 and his people.
00:02:23 When it was time to create  the boat sequences, production moved
00:02:26 to Louisiana
00:02:27 to make use of a large water tank located there.
00:02:32 Remote volunteers assisted with the preparation of the tank
00:02:35 as well as labor and materials needed to construct the boat.
00:02:39 Additionally, they provided rescue-diver support and meals for the crew.
00:02:46 A non-Witness consultant
00:02:48 had some interesting observations on what he saw.
00:02:53 There’s a certain peace about this place.
00:02:56 Prayer in the morning is good.
00:02:58 Yeah, it works.
00:03:00 There are no politics on set.
00:03:03 There’s a mission and a goal set for the day.
00:03:05 It’s well explained.
00:03:07 It’s like a family.
00:03:09 Producers and directors would be rather jealous
00:03:11 that it’s a well-run, tidy operation.
00:03:15 Production finally ended back
00:03:17 at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson
00:03:20 in a large outdoor set designed to replicate several streets
00:03:24 and a courtyard of Nineveh.
00:03:36 Once principal shooting was completed,
00:03:39 visual effects needed to be added to create realistic environments
00:03:42 that would make the story even more immersive.
00:04:04 Add to that hundreds of hours
00:04:06 spent in the editing rooms, stitching the pieces together
00:04:09 to create a cohesive story.
00:04:12 But still more work was needed.
00:04:13 I thought you wouldn’t be back.
00:04:15 I’m so sorry, Joanna.
00:04:16 Music had to be composed
00:04:18 and sound effects added.
00:04:23 Jonah! Jonah!
00:04:25 Jonah, look!
00:04:27 I got figs!
00:04:28 King David said at Psalm 40:1-3:
00:04:32 “I earnestly hoped in Jehovah . . .
00:04:35 “He made my footing secure. . . .
00:04:38 Many will look on in awe and put their trust in Jehovah.”
00:04:42 The volunteers who worked
00:04:43 on the Jonah drama found David’s words to be true.
00:04:47 Listen to just some of the expressions of appreciation from viewers.
00:04:51 “Thank you for all of your hard work.
00:04:53 “We laughed and cried and sat on the edge of our seats,
00:04:56 and the lessons hit home for each of us.”
00:04:59 “I tried to imagine how to be courageous and boldly preach like Jonah.
00:05:03 I no longer felt fear.”
00:05:05 Thank you.
00:05:06 Much like Jonah, the cast and crew involved in the making of this film
00:05:10 were reminded continuously
00:05:13 that no matter how challenging the assignment,
00:05:15 Jehovah will help us face it.

Emma and I were so worried

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about her Bible study, Palesa.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had spent another sleepless night

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after again hearing
her dead grandmother’s voice,

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plus the sound of slamming doors
and items crashing in the house.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Palesa had put an amulet
on her baby’s wrist for protection,

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the terror continued all night long.

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it wasn’t really her grandmother,

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing in the house was broken;

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:54.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the attack was real.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stories about the spirit world weren’t new to me.

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our neighbors, the people I work with,

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:11.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people in our territory

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:15.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—almost everyone believes in spirits,
whether they admit it or not.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No—more than believe—they fear them!

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had only been studying the Bible
about six months longer than Palesa.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my study had proved to me
that wicked spirits are here on earth,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they try to interact with people,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they are dangerous enemies.

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma called the elders for help.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t want us to handle
the situation on our own.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Emma told the story,

00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to speak up and tell the elders
that she was leaving things out.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was surprised when the elders
said they didn’t need all the details.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They explained that while we are aware
of the danger the demons pose,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not spend time
talking about their activities.

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Jesus, when he was on earth,

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have told his disciples many stories

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the doings of wicked spirits,

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead,
he focused on Jehovah and His activities.

00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:33.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should do the same

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:36.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of telling stories about what the demons

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may or may not have done.

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders skillfully used the Bible,
shepherding everyone.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Ephesians 6:11:

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:52.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be able to stand firm

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:55.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those instructions were so important.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:07.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A soldier would be vulnerable
if he only wore part of his armor

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if he didn’t keep it in good repair.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we read Ephesians 4:27:

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not give the Devil an opportunity.”

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:26.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders explained to Palesa

00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the string around her daughter’s wrist

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not part of the armor from God.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, it is giving Satan
an opportunity to continue to harass the family.

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers reminded us
that anyone who wants Jehovah’s protection

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must completely break free

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from anything associated with superstition,

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritism, and demon worship.

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who would ever choose to side
with wicked spirits instead of with Jehovah?

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma reminded Palesa
of how urgent the situation was.

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But only Palesa could decide what she would do.

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be a loyal servant of Jehovah.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:33.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I’m getting baptized.

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:36.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve decided not to listen to or tell

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any more stories about the demons.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to look at other parts of my life.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:49.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I doing anything
that would “give the Devil an opportunity”?

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly,
there are still changes I need to make.

00:00:09 Emma and I were so worried
00:00:11 about her Bible study, Palesa.
00:00:14 She had spent another sleepless night
00:00:17 after again hearing her dead grandmother’s voice,
00:00:21 plus the sound of slamming doors and items crashing in the house.
00:00:35 Palesa had put an amulet on her baby’s wrist for protection,
00:00:39 but the terror continued all night long.
00:00:44 Of course, it wasn’t really her grandmother,
00:00:47 and nothing in the house was broken;
00:00:51 but the attack was real.
00:01:02 Stories about the spirit world weren’t new to me.
00:01:05 Our neighbors, the people I work with,
00:01:09 the people in our territory
00:01:11 —almost everyone believes in spirits, whether they admit it or not.
00:01:16 No—more than believe—they fear them!
00:01:22 I had only been studying the Bible about six months longer than Palesa.
00:01:28 But my study had proved to me that wicked spirits are here on earth,
00:01:33 that they try to interact with people,
00:01:35 and that they are dangerous enemies.
00:01:41 Emma called the elders for help.
00:01:43 She didn’t want us to handle the situation on our own.
00:01:54 As Emma told the story,
00:01:56 I had to speak up and tell the elders that she was leaving things out.
00:02:03 But I was surprised when the elders said they didn’t need all the details.
00:02:08 They explained that while we are aware of the danger the demons pose,
00:02:13 we do not spend time talking about their activities.
00:02:17 Even Jesus, when he was on earth,
00:02:20 could have told his disciples many stories
00:02:23 about the doings of wicked spirits,
00:02:25 but instead, he focused on Jehovah and His activities.
00:02:30 We should do the same
00:02:33 instead of telling stories about what the demons
00:02:36 may or may not have done.
00:02:39 The elders skillfully used the Bible, shepherding everyone.
00:02:43 We read Ephesians 6:11:
00:02:46 “Put on the complete suit of armor from God
00:02:49 “so that you may be able to stand firm
00:02:52 against the crafty acts of the Devil.”
00:02:59 Those instructions were so important.
00:03:03 A soldier would be vulnerable if he only wore part of his armor
00:03:07 or if he didn’t keep it in good repair.
00:03:15 Then we read Ephesians 4:27:
00:03:19 “Do not give the Devil an opportunity.”
00:03:23 The elders explained to Palesa
00:03:26 that the string around her daughter’s wrist
00:03:28 is not part of the armor from God.
00:03:31 Instead, it is giving Satan an opportunity to continue to harass the family.
00:03:38 The brothers reminded us that anyone who wants Jehovah’s protection
00:03:43 must completely break free
00:03:45 from anything associated with superstition,
00:03:48 spiritism, and demon worship.
00:03:52 Who would ever choose to side with wicked spirits instead of with Jehovah?
00:04:00 Emma reminded Palesa of how urgent the situation was.
00:04:06 But only Palesa could decide what she would do.
00:04:27 I want to be a loyal servant of Jehovah.
00:04:30 That’s why I’m getting baptized.
00:04:33 I’ve decided not to listen to or tell
00:04:36 any more stories about the demons.
00:04:39 But more than that,
00:04:41 I need to look at other parts of my life.
00:04:44 Am I doing anything that would “give the Devil an opportunity”?
00:04:49 Clearly, there are still changes I need to make.

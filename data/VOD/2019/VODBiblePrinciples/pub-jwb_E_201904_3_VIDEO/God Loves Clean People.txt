00:00:06 I graduated from high school that summer
00:00:08 and wanted to start regular pioneering.
00:00:11 That’s my dad, Grayson.
00:00:16 Dad was having car trouble that morning
00:00:19 and needed a ride to work, so I gave him one.
00:00:25 OK, my car was a little messy and smelly.
00:00:35 I mean, it was winter, and my car is pretty old anyway.
00:00:39 So why bother?
00:00:40 When I get a new car, then I’ll keep it clean.
00:00:45 But he was making a big deal out of nothing.
00:00:53 That morning was not good.
00:01:06 I thought it was over.
00:01:08 But later that evening, Dad brought it up again.
00:01:13 But this time, it went better.
00:01:17 He showed me a picture of his first car.
00:01:20 It looked pretty old too.
00:01:21 He said that while our home or car may not be
00:01:24 fancy or luxurious, it should be as clean and presentable
00:01:28 as circumstances allow.
00:01:32 I still didn’t see what the big deal was.
00:01:34 Then, he explained that Jehovah is a clean God,
00:01:38 and from ancient times, he has always required
00:01:40 that his people be a clean people.
00:01:43 Under the Mosaic Law that Jehovah gave to Israel,
00:01:45 cleanness and worship were inseparable.
00:01:51 It specified that priests were required to wash their hands and feet
00:01:55 before offering sacrifices to Jehovah.
00:01:58 While in an unclean state, an Israelite
00:02:00 could not have any part in worship,
00:02:03 or it could mean death.
00:02:09 I said, “I’m not an Israelite,
00:02:12 and we’re not under the Mosaic Law anymore.”
00:02:15 He said, “True, but it gives us insight
00:02:17 into Jehovah’s thinking.”
00:02:20 The Law emphasized that cleanness
00:02:21 was required of all those who worshipped him.
00:02:24 And as Malachi 3:6 tells us,
00:02:27 ‘Jehovah has not changed.’
00:02:31 Then, he said something that really stuck with me,
00:02:35 “Besides, it’s not all about us.”
00:02:39 Then, he gave me a scripture to look up.
00:02:43 It was 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4:
00:02:47 “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling,
00:02:51 “so that no fault may be found with our ministry;
00:02:54 “but in every way
00:02:56 we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.”
00:03:14 I realized that things like our appearance,
00:03:17 our homes, and our cars
00:03:20 —these can all be a silent witness to Jehovah in themselves.
00:03:24 It made sense to me now.
00:03:26 It’s not all about us.
00:03:29 I knew what I had to do.
00:03:38 Not only did I clean my car, but later that year,
00:03:42 I was able to turn in my application for pioneering.
00:03:47 And I’m glad for the lesson I learned from my dad.
00:03:52 It’s not all about us.
00:03:55 Even in little ways,
00:03:59 we can reflect favorably on the God we love.

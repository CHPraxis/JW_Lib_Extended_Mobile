Mom has been working hard lately,

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wish she worked harder for Jehovah.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to help out where I can.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, by the way, I’m Jin.

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day starts the same.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I grab a drink of water;

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say hi to Jun (he’s in my congregation);

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:51.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then there’s Mee-Kyong.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
Here we go.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say hello,

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she says something clever,

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I try to leave.

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is different.

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s having trouble
in math and needs my help.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to be rude,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I help her with her homework,

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how far could the relationship develop?

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you say no to a girl like her?

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t I get her out of my head?

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things are always better

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Uncle and Auntie are around.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Mom makes sure
she’s home for “dinner and broadcast” night.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uncle wants to work together
in service this weekend;

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe that will help clear my head.

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must be disappointed in me.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t take it anymore.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult,

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I told Uncle everything.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt guilty that I knew I shouldn’t,

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I liked the attention.

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:41.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Genesis 39:7-12.

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the account about Potiphar’s wife,

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he mentioned something
I hadn’t thought of before.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told Potiphar’s wife:

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:56.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How could I commit this great badness

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:58.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually sin against God?”

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why did Joseph have to flee?

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:13.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph fought her every day,

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:16.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she wasn’t going to give up.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In her mind,
it wasn’t a question of if but when.

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There came a point when he had to flee.

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained why I was ending the relationship,

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:36.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she would not give up.

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the last thing she said to me?

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I was a coward.

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:55.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she’s wrong.

00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:59.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re never a coward if you run to Jehovah.

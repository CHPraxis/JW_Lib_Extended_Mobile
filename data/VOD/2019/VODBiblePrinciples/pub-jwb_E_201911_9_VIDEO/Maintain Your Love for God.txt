00:00:10 Getting baptized
00:00:12 was the most important decision I ever made.
00:00:15 But it took some time to realize that
00:00:17 that was just the start of my Christian life.
00:00:20 Sometimes it was hard to show courage.
00:00:22 Why don’t you people get involved and make a real difference for once?
00:00:33 And it was hard for my son too.
00:00:35 No thanks.
00:00:36 I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, and I don’t celebrate birthdays.
00:00:39 What?
00:00:40 Hum?
00:00:40 That’s rude.
00:00:41 Come on, sign it!
00:00:42 I really liked Lucas,
00:00:44 and he was very sick.
00:00:47 I really wanted to sign his birthday card,
00:00:51 but Dad helped me to see how Jehovah felt about it,
00:00:55 and that helped me be brave.
00:00:58 I still didn’t sign the card,
00:01:01 but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.
00:01:11 My parents had always set a good example for me.
00:01:15 But after I moved to serve where the need was greater,
00:01:18 it seemed like my parents were growing apart.
00:01:21 Are you both doing OK?
00:01:24 Because you don’t look OK.
00:01:26 Of course, we’re OK.
00:01:27 OK? We’re doing wonderful, right?
00:01:29 Yeah, we’re doing good.
00:01:30 Everything is good.
00:01:31 I was really worried.
00:01:34 Later, they told me that what helped them
00:01:37 was their love for Jehovah.
00:01:40 They meditated on the example of Abraham and Sarah,
00:01:44 who showed honor to each other by listening and by caring.
00:01:48 That example really helped my parents.
00:01:51 And since then,
00:01:53 I’ve seen how it can help in any relationship.
00:01:59 I’m a long way from home, but showing love to others
00:02:04 —it helps me to stay happy in my assignment.
00:02:12 When our doctor told us that our baby
00:02:14 would likely be born with severe problems
00:02:17 and could even die,
00:02:20 it was more than I could bear.
00:02:24 And because my husband was not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:02:29 I needed God’s help more than ever
00:02:33 to calm my heart and help me explain why I could never have an abortion.
00:02:38 And even though it took me years
00:02:41 before I would agree to a Bible study
00:02:44 and even more years before I made enough changes to qualify for baptism,
00:02:50 the life we have now
00:02:52 —serving Jehovah together—
00:02:55 nothing could make me happier.
00:02:58 Nothing could make us happier.
00:03:02 Happiness really does come from serving Jehovah,
00:03:06 but serving him faithfully definitely takes courage.
00:03:12 It was so hard for me to turn down that girl at school.
00:03:17 And I felt so guilty for how involved I’d gotten with her.
00:03:23 My uncle used the Bible to help me get back on track
00:03:26 and to remind me of two other very important things:
00:03:30 that Jehovah was proud of me and that I was not alone.
00:03:36 James 1:2, 3 says:
00:03:38 “Consider it all joy, my brothers,
00:03:41 “when you meet with various trials,
00:03:43 “knowing as you do
00:03:45 “that this tested quality of your faith
00:03:48 produces endurance.”
00:03:51 I think about that scripture a lot
00:03:53 because soon I’ll probably be sent
00:03:56 to prison for refusing military service.
00:04:00 Being courageous with that classmate
00:04:02 helped me build the faith and courage that I need now.
00:04:06 I can give up anything for Jehovah.
00:04:09 I might live in a small cell for now,
00:04:12 but in Paradise, I’m going to travel everywhere.
00:04:18 Sometimes I get lonely, but that’s OK.
00:04:21 It’s a choice that I’ve made to stay in my assignment right now.
00:04:26 In the future, if I choose to get married,
00:04:29 I hope to have a marriage like my parents.
00:04:35 I really hope that Lucas is resurrected so I can show him around Paradise
00:04:39 and teach him more about Jehovah.
00:04:42 I showed him pictures,
00:04:44 but the real thing will be so much better.
00:04:48 Then I can hold my baby girl again.

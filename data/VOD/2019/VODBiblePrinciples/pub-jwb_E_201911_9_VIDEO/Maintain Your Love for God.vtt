00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting baptized

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the most important decision I ever made.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it took some time to realize that

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was just the start of my Christian life.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it was hard to show courage.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you people get involved
and make a real difference for once?

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was hard for my son too.

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No thanks.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a Jehovah’s Witness,
and I don’t celebrate birthdays.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What? 

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:40.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hum?

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s rude.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on, sign it!

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really liked Lucas,

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was very sick.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wanted to sign his birthday card,

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Dad helped me to see
how Jehovah felt about it,

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helped me be brave.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still didn’t sign the card,

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents had always set
a good example for me.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after I moved
to serve where the need was greater,

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seemed like my parents were growing apart.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you both doing OK?

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you don’t look OK.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:27.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we’re OK.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK? We’re doing wonderful, right?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we’re doing good.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is good.

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really worried.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, they told me that what helped them

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was their love for Jehovah.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They meditated on the example
of Abraham and Sarah,

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:48.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who showed honor to each other
by listening and by caring.

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That example really helped my parents.

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:53.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since then,

00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:56.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen how it can help
in any relationship.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a long way from home,
but showing love to others

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it helps me to stay happy in my assignment.

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our doctor told us that our baby

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would likely be born with severe problems

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and could even die,

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was more than I could bear.

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because my husband
was not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed God’s help more than ever

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to calm my heart and help me explain
why I could never have an abortion.

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:41.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though it took me years

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I would agree to a Bible study

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even more years before I made
enough changes to qualify for baptism,

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the life we have now

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—serving Jehovah together—

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing could make me happier.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could make us happier.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happiness really does come
from serving Jehovah,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but serving him faithfully
definitely takes courage.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so hard for me
to turn down that girl at school.

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt so guilty
for how involved I’d gotten with her.

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My uncle used the Bible
to help me get back on track

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remind me
of two other very important things:

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:35.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was proud of me
and that I was not alone.

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:38.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:2, 3 says:

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Consider it all joy, my brothers,

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when you meet with various trials,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing as you do

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that this tested quality of your faith

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produces endurance.”

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:53.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think about that scripture a lot

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because soon I’ll probably be sent

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prison for refusing military service.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being courageous with that classmate

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me build the faith
and courage that I need now.

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can give up anything for Jehovah.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might live in a small cell for now,

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in Paradise,
I’m going to travel everywhere.

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I get lonely, but that’s OK.

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:26.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a choice that I’ve made
to stay in my assignment right now.

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:29.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the future, if I choose to get married,

00:04:29.748 --> 00:04:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope to have a marriage like my parents.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really hope that Lucas is resurrected
so I can show him around Paradise

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teach him more about Jehovah.

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I showed him pictures,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the real thing will be so much better.

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:53.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I can hold my baby girl again.

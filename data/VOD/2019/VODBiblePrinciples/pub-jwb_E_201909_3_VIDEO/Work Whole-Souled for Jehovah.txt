00:00:04 Sometimes I really hate my job.
00:00:08 I don’t know how Jason stays so positive.
00:00:27 I asked Jason why he refused the money,
00:00:30 and I found out that he’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:33 My wife is too,
00:00:35 so I know a lot about them.
00:00:37 But what Jason did really surprised me.
00:00:44 I wondered why he didn’t feel like
00:00:46 he was entitled to the extra money.
00:00:48 He’s such a hard worker,
00:00:50 and most of our supervisors accept bribes.
00:00:54 Jason showed me a Bible verse:
00:00:57 “Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled
00:01:00 as for Jehovah, and not for men.”
00:01:04 Jason’s relationship with God influences
00:01:07 every aspect of his life,
00:01:09 even his attitude toward work.
00:01:12 He couldn’t participate
00:01:14 in something dishonest, even if others did.
00:01:20 I could see that Jason really lived by his beliefs.
00:01:44 Jason invited me to see the construction project
00:01:47 he’s been volunteering at.
00:01:49 I felt like I had entered another world.
00:01:53 People of different races
00:01:55 worked alongside each other
00:01:57 without prejudice, and they were all volunteers.
00:02:04 Jason offered to study the Bible with me.
00:02:07 Emma has asked me to study in the past,
00:02:11 and I’ve always refused.
00:02:24 But this time, I accepted.
00:02:36 I liked my study
00:02:38 and even enjoyed going to the Kingdom Hall occasionally.
00:02:44 But I had to work overtime
00:02:47 to support my family.
00:02:49 I couldn’t go to meetings every week.
00:03:02 Hey, Jason,
00:03:04 how do you do it all
00:03:06 —work, family, meetings, even volunteer work?
00:03:11 I try to keep in mind Jesus’ words at Matthew 6:22.
00:03:20 Jesus compared our eyes to a lamp.
00:03:24 He said that if ‘our eye was focused, our whole body would be bright.’
00:03:29 It’s impossible
00:03:31 to focus on more than one thing at a time.
00:03:37 Jesus wanted his followers to focus on a single purpose:
00:03:41 that of doing God’s will.
00:03:43 Rather than being distracted by material things,
00:03:46 my wife and I lead a simple life,
00:03:48 avoiding unnecessary debt
00:03:51 or acquiring possessions that consume a lot of time and attention.
00:03:55 This way of life allows us to have time for what’s truly important.
00:03:59 If you asked Emma, which do you think she would prefer:
00:04:03 that you made more money or spent more time with her at the Kingdom Hall?
00:04:11 Jason’s example really impressed me.
00:04:14 He was an honest and diligent worker,
00:04:18 but he also kept secular work in its proper place.
00:04:22 It made me think about the choices I make,
00:04:26 and I decided that I too
00:04:28 wanted to ‘work whole-souled for Jehovah.’

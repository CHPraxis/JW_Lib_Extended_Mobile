00:00:01 The theme of this program
00:00:02 is taken from the second part
00:00:04 of Romans 12:10:
00:00:06 “In showing honor to one another,
00:00:08 take the lead.”
00:00:10 What is honor?
00:00:12 In the Hebrew Scriptures, the term translated “honor”
00:00:15 literally means “heaviness.”
00:00:18 So when we honor someone,
00:00:20 we’re acknowledging that he’s weighty
00:00:22 or that he amounts to something.
00:00:25 In the Greek Scriptures, the word is related
00:00:27 to setting a price on something,
00:00:30 meaning that the one we honor is esteemed or has value.
00:00:35 Whom should we honor?
00:00:37 Of course, Jehovah is worthy of honor.
00:00:41 Revelation 4:11 says this
00:00:44 and gives us the reason for giving glory and honor to Jehovah.
00:00:49 It says because he “created all things.”
00:00:53 He is responsible for us having life in the first place.
00:00:59 How do we give him honor?
00:01:01 There are many ways:
00:01:03 We honor him by doing his will
00:01:06 —obeying his laws and principles.
00:01:08 We honor him by extolling his qualities and promises
00:01:12 —telling others about these gifts from God.
00:01:16 We show him honor by contributing financially
00:01:19 to the worldwide educational work
00:01:21 that he’s directing through his Son and holy spirit.
00:01:26 And just as Revelation chapter 4 said
00:01:29 about Jehovah being worthy of the honor,
00:01:33 Revelation 5:12
00:01:36 says that his Son, Christ Jesus,
00:01:38 is worthy of the same.
00:01:41 Verse 12 says of Jesus:
00:01:44 “They were saying with a loud voice:
00:01:46 “‘The Lamb who was slaughtered
00:01:48 “‘is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom
00:01:52 and strength and honor and glory and blessing.’”
00:01:56 How do we show honor to Jesus?
00:01:59 One way is acknowledged in the verse we just read.
00:02:03 He was “slaughtered” like a sacrificial lamb
00:02:06 so that we might have the hope of everlasting life.
00:02:09 We highly esteem, and value, that sacrifice.
00:02:13 We honor Jesus by recognizing his role
00:02:16 as an immortal “King of kings” in the heavens.
00:02:19 And another very practical way to honor Jesus
00:02:22 is to strive to imitate his life and personality
00:02:26 as the model for us to follow closely.
00:02:29 If we take the lead in showing honor,
00:02:32 who else will we view as highly valued
00:02:35 —to be treated with esteem?
00:02:38 Ephesians 6:1, 2 says
00:02:41 that children ‘honor their father and mother’ when they’re obedient to them.
00:02:45 Matthew 15:4-6
00:02:48 makes it clear that adult children
00:02:50 honor their parents and grandparents
00:02:52 by giving material assistance to them as needed.
00:02:57 First Timothy 5:17
00:03:00 urges us to give elders “double honor”
00:03:03 because of their hard work in our behalf.
00:03:05 Romans 13:1, 7
00:03:08 even extends the matter of showing honor
00:03:10 to governmental rulers and others in authority.
00:03:15 First Peter 2:17
00:03:18 broadens the meaning of honor even further saying:
00:03:21 “Honor men of all sorts.”
00:03:24 In addition to being kind and respectful to people in general,
00:03:29 we also honor them by being willing
00:03:31 to spend time sharing the good news with them.
00:03:35 Ephesians 5:22-25
00:03:38 appeals to wives to honor their husbands
00:03:41 by having Christlike subjection for them.
00:03:44 Husbands are to honor their wives by showing them love
00:03:48 and treating them just as Jesus treated the congregation.
00:03:53 And what about our theme text for this discussion?
00:03:57 Who was Paul addressing in Romans chapter 12 when he said:
00:04:01 “In showing honor to one another, take the lead”?
00:04:05 Who are the “one another” in that verse?
00:04:10 Look at Romans 1:7 with me.
00:04:15 Paul says he’s writing “to all those who are in Rome
00:04:19 as God’s beloved ones, called to be holy ones.”
00:04:23 So all of us in the Christian congregation
00:04:26 are to have honor for each other.
00:04:30 I’d like to spend the balance of my time
00:04:33 discussing two of the many opportunities
00:04:36 we have to show honor
00:04:38 (they’re the last two that I just referenced):
00:04:42 first, marriage mates showing honor to each other,
00:04:46 and second, showing honor to one another in our congregations.
00:04:51 Marriages in general today are seriously lacking in honor.
00:04:56 Marriage mates often demean one another
00:04:59 with harsh words and disrespectful attitudes.
00:05:03 Some in the world resort to physical violence,
00:05:06 as if that somehow makes the abusive one right
00:05:09 in his view of whatever the issue is.
00:05:12 And infidelity on the part of one or both mates is so common
00:05:17 it doesn’t even raise eyebrows anymore.
00:05:20 All of this is a gross lack of honor in marriage.
00:05:26 But what about marriages
00:05:28 of those professing to be Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:05:32 We’re blessed with so many marriages
00:05:34 that are wholesome and honorable.
00:05:37 True, none are perfect.
00:05:41 But how blessed we are to have the truth
00:05:43 and to have learned to be more and more Christlike with each other.
00:05:48 We’ve learned to shed things that we heard when we were growing up.
00:05:52 However, the matter of honoring our marriage mate
00:05:56 needs to be discussed.
00:05:59 While relatively few of our marriages
00:06:01 end up with some kind of physical violence
00:06:04 and relatively few end up in divorce,
00:06:07 what about having honor in the marriage?
00:06:12 After living together as husband and wife
00:06:14 for many months or for years or even for decades,
00:06:18 familiarity can cause us
00:06:20 to treat each other with less respect or honor
00:06:23 than when we were courting.
00:06:25 That isn’t right.
00:06:28 It isn’t Christlike.
00:06:31 But with our inherited imperfection,
00:06:34 we may succumb to dishonorable words and behavior
00:06:37 with the one that we promised to treasure
00:06:39 “until death do us part.”
00:06:43 How can we get a grip on this trait and minimize the times
00:06:47 that we have a clash of spirit and words?
00:06:51 First, let’s consider
00:06:54 the two basic responsibilities assigned to marriage mates.
00:06:58 This is the foundation
00:07:00 that we can then build on to improve.
00:07:05 The role of the husband is clearly stated
00:07:08 at 1 Corinthians 11:3.
00:07:11 And while some wives in society may bristle at this thought,
00:07:16 wives serving Jehovah are to embrace this thought.
00:07:20 It’s the arrangement of God.
00:07:23 First Corinthians 11:3 says:
00:07:27 “But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ;
00:07:31 “in turn, the head of a woman is the man;
00:07:34 in turn, the head of the Christ is God.”
00:07:37 God’s Word says that “the head of a woman is the man.”
00:07:42 However, the head of the woman
00:07:45 is not to be a domineering man,
00:07:47 not an abusive man —verbally or physically.
00:07:52 He is to imitate his head.
00:07:54 And who is that?
00:07:56 What did the first part of the verse say?
00:07:58 “The head of every man is the Christ.”
00:08:02 In fact, Ephesians chapter 5
00:08:06 strikes this fine balance between being a head of the wife
00:08:10 and being a loving head like the Christ.
00:08:13 Ephesians 5:22, 23 says:
00:08:17 “Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord,
00:08:22 “[But what of the disposition of the husband?]
00:08:25 “because a husband is head of his wife
00:08:28 “just as the Christ is head of the congregation,
00:08:31 he being a savior of this body.”
00:08:35 That verse says it all.
00:08:39 Verse 33 of the same chapter says this:
00:08:43 “Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself;
00:08:48 “on the other hand,
00:08:50 the wife should have deep respect for her husband.”
00:08:55 There’s nowhere in God’s Word
00:08:58 that says that if one mate pushes the other mate’s button
00:09:02 —emotionally— that it cancels
00:09:04 the offended mate’s obligation to be Christlike.
00:09:08 The problem is that when one mate is offended or hurt,
00:09:12 it’s so easy to roll the eyes in disgust
00:09:17 or to lash back with a verbal insult.
00:09:20 Then the other mate fires back with another harsh, cutting remark.
00:09:25 It’s like wind on a forest fire.
00:09:28 Tempers blaze, and the evening goes up in smoke.
00:09:32 It’s not at all Christlike.
00:09:35 There is no honor shown in such a conflagration.
00:09:40 It has to stop sooner rather than later.
00:09:46 The January 15, 2015, issue of The Watchtower said this:
00:09:51 “Remember that marriage is not a competition
00:09:56 “to find out who is stronger, who can shout louder,
00:09:59 “or who can think of the most cutting remark.
00:10:02 “True, we all have flaws, and sometimes we upset others.
00:10:07 “But there is never a justifiable reason
00:10:10 “for either a husband or a wife
00:10:13 “to use sarcastic and demeaning speech,
00:10:16 or worse, to shove or hit each other.”
00:10:21 How can we change the atmosphere?
00:10:24 Someone needs to put out the fire
00:10:27 with the water of God’s Word.
00:10:30 Romans 12:10b, again:
00:10:34 “In showing honor to one another, take the lead.”
00:10:39 One of the mates must take the lead
00:10:42 even if at the time they’re apologizing for their own behavior
00:10:46 by acknowledging that they didn’t respond in a Christlike way saying,
00:10:50 “Forgive me.”
00:10:54 That same issue of The Watchtower cited two scriptures:
00:10:58 one for the husband and one for the wife.
00:11:01 We’ll first read Proverbs 17:27.
00:11:07 Husbands, listen to this
00:11:10 and apply it prior to a rift
00:11:12 or even during the conflict.
00:11:15 Proverbs 17:27:
00:11:18 “A man of knowledge restrains his words,
00:11:22 and a discerning man will remain calm.”
00:11:26 Husbands, does that describe us?
00:11:32 Now wives,
00:11:34 please locate Proverbs 31:26.
00:11:40 Does this describe your speech even when some altercation occurs?
00:11:45 Proverbs 31:26:
00:11:48 “She opens her mouth in wisdom;
00:11:50 the law of kindness is on her tongue.”
00:11:54 Usually after a misunderstanding and rash words have been said,
00:11:59 we feel miserable and upset.
00:12:02 We often chastise ourselves for adding fuel to the fire.
00:12:07 How much better to train ourselves to restrain our words
00:12:11 and remain calm and to speak
00:12:13 in wisdom and with kindness of tongue.
00:12:18 Meet Emil and Firuca Gârbovan from Romania.
00:12:22 They’re good examples of how the power of God’s Word
00:12:26 can mold and change the attitudes of marriage mates
00:12:29 who are willing to be guided by it.
00:12:34 It was in 1983 when I met Firuca.
00:12:40 I already had two little girls.
00:12:43 One was seven years old,
00:12:45 and the other one was three.
00:12:47 I accepted to study the Bible.
00:12:49 My husband worked
00:12:51 as a warrant officer for the police,
00:12:53 so at the beginning, I studied in secret.
00:12:57 Then I decided to tell him the truth.
00:12:59 When I found out
00:13:02 that my wife was studying the Bible
00:13:04 in order to become
00:13:05 one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:13:07 I became very sad.
00:13:10 And I realized that our marriage
00:13:12 and our family was in danger
00:13:15 because I only knew bad things
00:13:17 about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:13:22 He threatened he would divorce me, and he did.
00:13:27 The divorce was a very difficult time in my life
00:13:31 because I was seven months pregnant with our third daughter.
00:13:36 Following the divorce, my husband was given the house and custody
00:13:41 of our two daughters.
00:13:43 I had to leave the house,
00:13:46 and I stayed for almost a year with two families of our brothers.
00:13:54 I saw Jehovah’s love toward me,
00:13:57 and I loved Jehovah very much,
00:14:00 but I loved my husband too.
00:14:05 One day, as I was walking
00:14:08 and holding the little girl’s hand,
00:14:11 I saw Firuca’s husband walking toward me.
00:14:14 My heart stopped,
00:14:16 and I said to myself,
00:14:19 ‘He is going to hit me!’
00:14:21 But Emil was a gentleman.
00:14:24 And he took the little girl in his arms,
00:14:27 talked to her for a few minutes,
00:14:30 and then he put her back down and left.
00:14:34 When I saw him leaving, I thanked Jehovah
00:14:38 because he didn’t beat me.
00:14:42 In 1990, I looked for my wife
00:14:45 and I told her that I would like to remarry her
00:14:49 to reunite our family.
00:14:52 And, after a while, she agreed
00:14:54 and step-by-step I started to study.
00:14:58 In 2003, I became
00:15:01 one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:15:04 I am very happy that I made this change,
00:15:07 and I regret that I didn’t do it sooner.
00:15:13 I personally saw
00:15:15 how the truth can change a person’s life,
00:15:18 even in my own family.
00:15:22 Currently, I serve as an elder.
00:15:24 And in 2010, I became a regular pioneer.
00:15:28 When I see Emil conduct
00:15:31 the Bible study next to me,
00:15:34 I feel like kneeling rather than standing
00:15:38 to thank Jehovah.
00:15:42 So to married couples who love Jehovah we repeat:
00:15:47 “In showing honor . . . , take the lead.”
00:15:50 The principles just discussed can also be applied
00:15:54 when showing honor to others in the congregation.
00:15:57 Like the husband and wife that we just discussed,
00:16:00 all of us should be improving in imitating Jesus
00:16:04 and in ‘following his steps closely’ in all of our interactions
00:16:08 with fellow believers in the congregation.
00:16:11 How do we show honor to one another?
00:16:14 One way is well described
00:16:16 at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.
00:16:20 We show honor when we put the other person’s feelings
00:16:24 and needs ahead of our own.
00:16:27 First Corinthians 10:23, 24:
00:16:31 “All things are lawful,
00:16:33 “but not all things are advantageous.
00:16:36 “All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
00:16:40 “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage,
00:16:44 but that of the other person.”
00:16:47 We show honor when we suppress our own rights.
00:16:51 What we do or say might be lawful, but is it advantageous?
00:16:56 Will it build up?
00:16:58 Verse 24, then, concisely says it:
00:17:01 “Keep seeking, not [our] own advantage [or right],
00:17:05 but that of the other person.”
00:17:09 We show honor to others when we do good deeds for them.
00:17:13 Possibly, it’s even a humble task
00:17:16 that an elderly publisher needs done.
00:17:18 It could be offering to clean the house,
00:17:21 take them to the store, or fill some other need.
00:17:25 The principle is at Luke 22:26:
00:17:28 “You, though, are not to be that way.
00:17:31 “But let the one who is the greatest among you
00:17:33 “become as the youngest,
00:17:35 and the one taking the lead as the one ministering.”
00:17:40 Earlier, I cited 1 Timothy 5:17,
00:17:44 where we’re urged to give elders “double honor”
00:17:47 because of their hard work in our behalf.
00:17:49 They’re also part of our congregation and deserve honor.
00:17:54 In our August program last year,
00:17:56 Brother Lett helped us consider much of what is involved.
00:18:00 You’ll recall that his subject was
00:18:03 “Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”
00:18:06 We minister to or honor others
00:18:09 when we readily forgive them
00:18:11 if they’ve embarrassed us or hurt our feelings.
00:18:15 Overall, Jehovah’s people do quite well
00:18:18 in honoring one another  in the congregation.
00:18:21 But here is the question:
00:18:23 Are we improving in this aspect
00:18:26 of our Christian personality?
00:18:29 In our theme scripture,
00:18:31 Paul didn’t just say to honor one another.
00:18:35 He said to “widen out” or reach out
00:18:38 in this aspect of our Christian life.
00:18:41 His words were to “take the lead.”
00:18:45 If Paul had just said to show honor to each other,
00:18:49 that would be like a teacher
00:18:51 urging a group of literate students to learn to read.
00:18:55 If they’re literate, they don’t need to learn to read.
00:18:59 But what might the teacher be urging them to do?
00:19:03 He might encourage them to read better, or to improve.
00:19:08 Love is the identifying mark of Christ’s disciples.
00:19:12 So honor is something we’ve learned to show.
00:19:16 However, like the teacher,
00:19:19 Paul is urging us to improve in this area.
00:19:22 He said take the lead in showing honor.
00:19:26 The footnote says this could be rendered
00:19:29 taking the “initiative” in showing honor.
00:19:34 Instead of waiting
00:19:35 for some obvious reason to do good for others
00:19:38 —to commend someone, to check on a shut-in—
00:19:41 look for opportunities to take the initiative
00:19:44 to show honor in the family and in our congregations.
00:19:49 Yes, “in showing honor . . . ,  take the lead”!

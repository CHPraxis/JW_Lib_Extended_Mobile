00:00:02 One of the most underrated qualities
00:00:04 in today’s world is modesty.
00:00:07 In fact, the world encourages
00:00:09 the exact opposite of modesty.
00:00:11 The world says that you are the most important person;
00:00:15 you should promote yourself; you have no limits;
00:00:20 you have the right to be anything you want to be.
00:00:24 As we’ll see, the world’s thinking is completely backward
00:00:28 —and for several reasons.
00:00:30 Really, modesty is a quality
00:00:33 that stems from everything that is good.
00:00:37 Our theme scripture for this discussion is Micah 6:8:
00:00:43 “He has told you . . . what is good.
00:00:45 “And what is Jehovah requiring of you?
00:00:48 “Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty,
00:00:53 and to walk in modesty with your God!”
00:00:57 Notice that modesty is one
00:00:59 of the key aspects of “what is good.”
00:01:02 To help us understand why,
00:01:04 let’s discuss three questions:
00:01:06 What is modesty?
00:01:09 Why do we want to have this quality?
00:01:12 How can we cultivate it?
00:01:14 First, what is modesty?
00:01:18 Basically, it’s an awareness of our limitations.
00:01:22 Of course, we often link modesty
00:01:24 with appropriate dress and grooming,
00:01:27 but much more is involved.
00:01:29 How do we know?
00:01:31 Consider what we read at Proverbs 11:2:
00:01:35 “When presumptuousness comes,
00:01:38 “dishonor will follow,
00:01:40 but wisdom is with the modest ones.”
00:01:44 Notice that modesty is contrasted
00:01:46 with a negative quality—presumptuousness.
00:01:50 A presumptuous person runs ahead without the authority to do so.
00:01:55 He or she ignores proper boundaries and limitations.
00:01:58 That kind of attitude often leads to foolish mistakes
00:02:02 and a bad reputation with fellow humans.
00:02:05 And above all, it can cause a person to lose God’s favor.
00:02:11 For example, we might think of King Saul.
00:02:14 Although he started out as a modest young man,
00:02:17 in time he became presumptuous.
00:02:20 He even went so far as to offer up
00:02:23 a burnt sacrifice even though he was not authorized to do so.
00:02:28 As a result,
00:02:30 Saul lost Jehovah’s favor
00:02:33 and eventually the kingship.
00:02:35 In Saul’s case, presumptuousness definitely
00:02:38 led to dishonor.
00:02:40 On the other hand,
00:02:42 a wise and modest person
00:02:44 recognizes his limitations and works within them.
00:02:49 Why is modesty the course of wisdom?
00:02:53 This brings us to our second main point,
00:02:55 Why do we want to have this quality?
00:02:58 The foremost reason
00:03:00 is that modesty is essential
00:03:03 to pleasing our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:03:06 Although we don’t speak of Jehovah as being modest,
00:03:09 even he works within certain limitations
00:03:12 that he’s imposed on himself.
00:03:14 He teaches us by example how to demonstrate this quality,
00:03:19 even though it’s not one that he needs to display.
00:03:23 Why can we say that Jehovah imposes limitations on himself?
00:03:28 Consider just one example:
00:03:30 He’ll never violate the gift of free will that he’s granted us.
00:03:35 Jehovah will never force us to serve him
00:03:38 —even though, of course, he has the power to do so.
00:03:42 Aren’t we grateful that he allows us to serve him
00:03:46 because we choose to out of love
00:03:48 and not because we are forced to?
00:03:52 Jehovah teaches us to display modesty in other ways as well.
00:03:56 For example, we might think of how he listened patiently
00:04:00 as Abraham voiced his concerns about Jehovah’s purpose
00:04:04 to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
00:04:07 or how Jehovah invited the angels to suggest ways to fool Ahab
00:04:11 and then authorized one of their suggestions to be carried out.
00:04:16 What’s the lesson for us?
00:04:18 If Jehovah, who doesn’t need input or help from anyone,
00:04:22 patiently listens and delegates,
00:04:24 how much more should we do so
00:04:27 —especially since we’re all so imperfect and limited!
00:04:31 Are you a family head or an elder in the congregation,
00:04:35 or do you have another responsible position in the organization?
00:04:39 If so, you can imitate Jehovah
00:04:42 by not micromanaging others.
00:04:45 Be willing to delegate tasks to them
00:04:48 and listen to their suggestions.
00:04:50 Imitate Jehovah’s example of dignifying others
00:04:54 and wanting to help them succeed.
00:04:58 Besides pleasing Jehovah,
00:05:00 we have other good reasons to be modest.
00:05:03 Modesty helps us to be joyful.
00:05:06 How so?
00:05:08 By going hand in hand with a related quality—gratitude.
00:05:13 A faithful brother who worked in the Writing Department
00:05:16 for some 50 years was fond of saying,
00:05:19 “Only a grateful person can be happy.”
00:05:23 If we’re modestly aware of our limitations,
00:05:26 we’ll be grateful and happy
00:05:28 for the help that we receive from others.
00:05:31 For example,
00:05:33 think of the leper who returned
00:05:35 to thank Jesus for healing him.
00:05:37 This man realized his limitations.
00:05:40 He was very thankful that Jesus had done something for him
00:05:44 that he could never have done on his own.
00:05:48 Another reason to cultivate modesty
00:05:51 is that it promotes good relationships with others.
00:05:55 Let’s face it:
00:05:57 People aren’t usually drawn to those who think,
00:05:59 ‘If I want something done right,
00:06:02 I have to do it myself.’
00:06:05 But they usually appreciate it when they’re shown
00:06:08 that we have confidence in them.
00:06:10 This, in turn, draws them to us.
00:06:15 Another way that modesty promotes good relationships
00:06:18 is that it helps us to avoid comparing ourselves to others.
00:06:22 Comparing ourselves to others
00:06:25 is always a dangerous road to navigate.
00:06:29 Just think, for example, of Jesus’ apostles
00:06:32 who argued many times over who was the greatest
00:06:38 or of Joseph’s brothers and the terrible things they did
00:06:41 because of being jealous of Joseph.
00:06:44 A modest person doesn’t obsess
00:06:47 over his perceived rank in comparison with others.
00:06:50 In this regard,
00:06:52 we can remember the good example of Moses.
00:06:55 How did he react when Jehovah
00:06:57 enabled some of his fellow Israelites
00:06:59 to begin acting as prophets alongside him?
00:07:03 Moses rejoiced,
00:07:05 saying that he wished all of Jehovah’s people were prophets.
00:07:09 Moses didn’t feel that he was the only one who should have such a privilege.
00:07:15 Finally, modesty promotes good relationships with others
00:07:20 because it prevents us from bragging about our accomplishments
00:07:24 or drawing undue attention to ourselves,
00:07:27 which could stir up resentment in others.
00:07:31 So now we know what modesty is and why we want to have it.
00:07:35 This brings us to our third main point,
00:07:37 How can we cultivate this beautiful quality?
00:07:41 One thing we can do
00:07:43 is to read and meditate on Bible examples
00:07:47 —both good and bad— such as those we just discussed.
00:07:51 Other Bible examples include Daniel,
00:07:54 who modestly didn’t take credit
00:07:56 for the interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.
00:07:59 The lesson for us?
00:08:01 If we’re privileged to have a teaching assignment
00:08:04 or we enjoy a measure of success in the ministry,
00:08:08 we want to give all the glory to Jehovah.
00:08:11 We should modestly recognize
00:08:14 that we couldn’t do these things without his help.
00:08:18 We can also study the example of Jesus,
00:08:20 who didn’t even think of trying to grasp
00:08:23 for more authority than Jehovah had granted him.
00:08:26 Philippians 2:6 tells us:
00:08:29 “He . . . gave no consideration to a seizure,
00:08:32 namely, that he should be equal to God.”
00:08:36 Consider how Jesus responded
00:08:39 when his disciples James and John approached him
00:08:41 with their mother and asked for a privilege
00:08:44 that was beyond his authority to grant them.
00:08:48 Jesus modestly acknowledged
00:08:50 that only Jehovah could decide
00:08:53 who would sit at his right and left hand in the Kingdom.
00:08:56 Jesus respected his limitations.
00:09:00 What are some other ways we can cultivate modesty?
00:09:04 One is to apply the Bible’s counsel
00:09:07 found at 1 Corinthians 4:6:
00:09:10 “Do not go beyond the things that are written.”
00:09:14 This refers primarily to ‘the things written’ in God’s Word.
00:09:18 By extension, the principle also applies to the Scriptural direction
00:09:23 that we receive from our publications.
00:09:25 When asked for advice,
00:09:27 we would never want to impose our own opinion
00:09:31 or simply give an answer off the top of our head.
00:09:34 Rather, we want to direct attention
00:09:37 to the counsel found in the Bible
00:09:39 and Bible-based publications.
00:09:42 Another way we can cultivate modesty
00:09:45 is by asking for frank comments
00:09:47 from a trusted friend
00:09:49 as to whether or not we have a reputation for being modest.
00:09:53 In this regard, we remember the Bible principle:
00:09:58 “As iron sharpens iron,
00:10:00 so one man sharpens his friend.”
00:10:03 If someone is willing to offer
00:10:06 kind observations about how we can improve,
00:10:09 we wouldn’t want to bristle at the comments.
00:10:12 Granted, it may sting our pride to hear such honest feedback,
00:10:16 but don’t we all need to hear these things from time to time?
00:10:21 As imperfect humans,
00:10:23 each one of us has blind spots, as it were.
00:10:26 It’s hard to see ourselves the way others see us.
00:10:30 Remember, we can work to improve our Christian personality
00:10:35 —but only if we know the areas that could use some improvement.
00:10:40 We can’t change what we don’t see.
00:10:43 A word of caution:
00:10:45 We want to beware of false modesty.
00:10:48 Remember that it’s not about simply appearing modest
00:10:52 but actually being modest at heart.
00:10:55 To help us examine ourselves,
00:10:57 we might meditate on questions like these:
00:11:01 When I receive advice or counsel,
00:11:04 how do I really feel about it at heart?
00:11:07 Does my internal reaction depend on whether the person giving it
00:11:11 has less or more experience or authority than I do?
00:11:16 Am I willing to accept valid suggestions regardless of who offers them?
00:11:22 A final way we can develop true modesty
00:11:24 is to ask Jehovah to help us.
00:11:27 We know what James 1:17 says:
00:11:32 “Every good gift and every perfect present is from above,
00:11:37 coming down from the Father of the celestial lights.”
00:11:41 Since modesty is one of Jehovah’s good gifts to us,
00:11:46 we can be sure that if we pray to Jehovah and ask him
00:11:49 to help us cultivate this quality,
00:11:51 he’ll answer our sincere prayers.
00:11:55 In review, what is modesty?
00:11:58 It’s a proper recognition of our limitations.
00:12:02 Why do we want to have this quality?
00:12:05 Because it pleases Jehovah,
00:12:07 it promotes good relationships with others,
00:12:10 and it adds to our joy.
00:12:13 How can we cultivate modesty?
00:12:16 There are many ways:
00:12:18 We can meditate on Bible examples, both good and bad,
00:12:22 and then apply the lessons in our own life.
00:12:25 We should apply the counsel to ‘not go beyond the things written.’
00:12:30 We can ask others for honest feedback
00:12:32 on how we’re doing in showing this quality.
00:12:35 And above all, we can pray to Jehovah
00:12:38 and ask him to help us develop it more fully.
00:12:42 When we think of all the positive ways
00:12:45 that modesty benefits ourselves and others,
00:12:48 wouldn’t you agree that it truly is a quality
00:12:50 that comes from “what is good”?

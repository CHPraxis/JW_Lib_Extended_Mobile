00:00:01 Our theme this month is
00:00:03 “Christian Neutrality
00:00:05 “—What It Means, What It Takes,
00:00:08 and Why We Choose It.”
00:00:10 What is your opinion?
00:00:12 Where do you stand?
00:00:14 Can one person make a difference in countering injustice?
00:00:19 When we hear people discussing political topics,
00:00:22 we might at first think their conversation is purely philosophical;
00:00:26 but when injustice threatens our loved ones,
00:00:29 it can seem personal.
00:00:32 We expect that people will be divided over political ideology.
00:00:36 Revelation chapters 8-13 foretold that in the last days,
00:00:40 government would be the burning issue among mankind
00:00:45 and that people would feel pressured to take sides.
00:00:49 The question each of us needs to ask himself is,
00:00:52 How do I respond when people debate solutions to serious injustices?
00:00:58 As Christians, we’re most interested
00:01:01 in the example of Christ.
00:01:04 If ever there was a person who could make a difference in countering injustice,
00:01:08 it was Jesus.
00:01:10 He felt deep compassion for people.
00:01:13 And with his abilities to feed the hungry,
00:01:15 heal the sick, raise the dead, and reach hearts with his winsome words,
00:01:20 Jesus could have exerted invincible influence in the realm of politics.
00:01:25 He certainly had the opportunity to do so.
00:01:28 Satan was pleased to offer him
00:01:30 “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth”
00:01:32 in an exchange for one act of worship.
00:01:35 But Jesus wouldn’t accept it.
00:01:37 Neither did he assert that Satan had no authority to make such an offer.
00:01:42 Later, Jesus’ own countrymen tried to make him king,
00:01:46 but he rejected that too.
00:01:48 Later still, someone asked him
00:01:51 whether it was lawful to pay taxes to the Roman government.
00:01:54 Again, Jesus didn’t take sides.
00:01:58 He refused to become a world ruler,
00:02:01 a national leader, or a political activist.
00:02:05 Did that mean that Jesus didn’t care? that he had no opinion?
00:02:10 To the contrary!
00:02:11 Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.
00:02:14 And by treating people fairly,
00:02:16 Jesus promoted justice at the most fundamental level.
00:02:20 Still, his principal focus
00:02:23 was on teaching people about the Kingdom of God,
00:02:26 which would eliminate injustice for all time.
00:02:29 So, what did Jesus indicate should be our position
00:02:33 regarding human governments?
00:02:36 We learn from Jesus’ response to the question about Roman taxation
00:02:40 as recorded at Mark 12:15-17:
00:02:46 “‘Bring me a denarius to look at.’
00:02:49 “They brought one, and he said to them:
00:02:52 “‘Whose image and inscription is this?’
00:02:55 “They said to him: ‘Caesar’s.’
00:02:57 “Jesus then said:
00:03:00 “‘Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,
00:03:03 but God’s things to God.’”
00:03:06 What are Caesar’s things?
00:03:09 At Romans 13:1-7,
00:03:13 the apostle Paul lists tax, tribute,
00:03:16 fear, and honor.
00:03:19 Notice, too, that Jesus said to “pay back Caesar’s things.”
00:03:24 What does that imply?
00:03:26 That Caesar,  the ruling authority of the day,
00:03:29 had issued valuable things —coins, for example.
00:03:33 Thus, Caesar had the right to ask for some of those coins back.
00:03:37 This enabled the State to continue rendering necessary services.
00:03:42 Jesus acknowledged that.
00:03:44 On the other hand,
00:03:46 our most valuable possessions are grants from God himself
00:03:50 —such gifts as our heart, our life, our mind, and our strength.
00:03:55 We can’t give those things back to Caesar
00:03:58 because Caesar didn’t grant them to us in the first place.
00:04:01 We rightly give those things back to God
00:04:04 in the form of our dedication and our love.
00:04:08 Regarding our love for God, Jesus said at Mark 12:30:
00:04:14 “You must love Jehovah your God
00:04:17 “with your whole heart and with your whole soul
00:04:21 “and with your whole mind
00:04:24 and with your whole strength.”
00:04:27 So the love we give back to God is total
00:04:31 —no bodily part, function,
00:04:33 capacity, or desire being left out.
00:04:36 Those who love God take the side of Jesus,
00:04:41 whom Jehovah has appointed as King.
00:04:45 But how would Jesus’ disciples defend his Kingdom when people opposed it?
00:04:50 We gain insight from events that occurred
00:04:53 on the last night of Jesus’ life on earth.
00:04:56 Recall from Matthew chapter 26
00:04:59 that when “a large crowd with swords and clubs” came to arrest Jesus,
00:05:03 Peter “drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.”
00:05:09 John reports that the slave’s name was Malchus.
00:05:13 Luke adds that Jesus touched the man’s ear and healed him.
00:05:17 Imagine that!
00:05:19 Jesus bore no ill will toward the men taking him into custody.
00:05:23 Further, according to Matthew 26:52,
00:05:27 Jesus told Peter:
00:05:29 “Return your sword to its place,
00:05:32 “for all those who take up the sword
00:05:34 will perish by the sword.”
00:05:38 Why did Jesus disapprove of Peter’s brave act?
00:05:42 For the same reason that he had avoided the political process all the way up to that point.
00:05:47 Jesus explained this when he appeared before Pontius Pilate later that night.
00:05:52 At John 18:36, we read:
00:05:57 “My Kingdom is no part of this world.”
00:06:03 Yes, because Jesus’ Kingdom is not of human origin,
00:06:06 it doesn’t need human defenses.
00:06:09 How can we be sure that this is what Jesus meant?
00:06:13 Look closely at the rest of John 18:36:
00:06:17 “If my Kingdom were part of this world,
00:06:21 “my attendants would have fought
00:06:23 “that I should not be handed over to the Jews.
00:06:25 “But as it is,
00:06:27 my Kingdom is not from this source.”
00:06:32 So as Christians,
00:06:34 what is our position where political matters are concerned?
00:06:38 We are neutral.
00:06:40 Sometimes people misunderstand this viewpoint.
00:06:44 Some have concluded that because we don’t promote one human government,
00:06:48 that we must be promoting another human government.
00:06:51 In the 1950’s, in what is now the Republic of Congo,
00:06:55 authorities falsely accused Jehovah’s Witnesses of being Communists.
00:06:59 But during the 1970’s,
00:07:01 when Congo adopted a Communist form of government,
00:07:04 the new authorities found fault with us for not being Communists!
00:07:09 Today, however, and for nearly three decades,
00:07:11 Jehovah’s Witnesses have enjoyed legal status in the Republic of Congo.
00:07:16 And whereas some have perceived
00:07:18 our Christian neutrality as sheer apathy,
00:07:21 others construe our position as a threat.
00:07:25 Let’s address both of these viewpoints.
00:07:28 First, there is a big difference
00:07:31 between Christian neutrality and apathy.
00:07:34 Apathy is defined
00:07:36 as “a lack of interest, enthusiasm, or concern.”
00:07:40 We certainly don’t lack interest in people,
00:07:42 nor are we insensitive to their feelings.
00:07:44 Like Jesus, we strive to alleviate people’s suffering
00:07:48 by helping them in practical ways
00:07:50 while teaching them about the only Kingdom
00:07:53 that can eliminate injustice.
00:07:55 By teaching people from God’s Word,
00:07:57 we endeavor to change hearts,
00:07:59 not political institutions.
00:08:02 We feel this approach is realistic
00:08:04 because mankind’s main problems are not political
00:08:08 but moral.
00:08:11 But why can it be said that Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a threat
00:08:14 but, rather, an asset?
00:08:17 We conscientiously obey the laws,
00:08:20 we support our communities through volunteer service
00:08:22 or compulsory civilian service where that exists,
00:08:26 and we pay our taxes.
00:08:28 It’s true, we don’t vote for political parties or candidates,
00:08:33 but neither do we disrupt elections
00:08:35 or interfere with those who choose to vote.
00:08:37 It’s true, we don’t lobby, campaign, or run for government office,
00:08:41 but neither do we criticize those in power,
00:08:44 undermine their policies, or demonstrate for political change.
00:08:48 It’s true, we won’t salute a flag,
00:08:51 but neither will we burn a flag, spit on a flag,
00:08:54 or disparage the nation that a flag represents
00:08:57 —even in lands where these are considered
00:09:00 protected expressions of freedom.
00:09:03 It’s true, we don’t sing national anthems,
00:09:06 but neither do we discourage others from singing,
00:09:09 nor do we make a public spectacle of not singing;
00:09:12 we simply don’t participate.
00:09:15 It’s true, we wouldn’t kill people in war,
00:09:18 but neither would we attack people at home.
00:09:21 So while we don’t promote any political position,
00:09:24 neither do we condemn any political position —even in our heart.
00:09:28 That is what neutrality means.
00:09:32 We don’t take sides.
00:09:35 But what if the demands of the State
00:09:38 conflict with the commands of Jesus?
00:09:42 There’s a Bible principle for that.
00:09:45 Are you thinking  of what it says at Acts 5:28, 29
00:09:50 —that “we must obey God as ruler rather than men”?
00:09:54 This is not disregard for the State,
00:09:57 but, rather, reverence for God.
00:10:00 If the State demands that we do what God forbids
00:10:03 or refrain from doing what God commands,
00:10:06 then we believe God would consider that an invalid request.
00:10:12 Now, one might say,
00:10:14 ‘I can imagine some situations where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.’
00:10:19 Jesus foretold as much at Matthew 24:9,
00:10:23 where he said: “You will be hated by all the nations
00:10:27 on account of my name.”
00:10:30 More specifically, at Revelation 2:10,
00:10:33 Jesus said that some of his disciples would be thrown into prison
00:10:37 —not all of us but some.
00:10:40 So we’re not disappointed if we don’t get thrown into prison,
00:10:44 but neither are we discouraged if we do.
00:10:47 Our minds turn to the thousands of brothers and sisters
00:10:50 who have been sentenced to prison over the years
00:10:52 for their Christian neutrality.
00:10:55 We are proud of them.
00:10:57 We pray for them.
00:10:58 We know that Jehovah is pleased with them.
00:11:02 Their endurance under trial spells victory for all of us.
00:11:07 How so?
00:11:09 To the congregation in Ephesus, Paul wrote:
00:11:14 “I ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations in your behalf,
00:11:18 for these mean glory for you.”
00:11:23 Paul wrote these words while he himself was under house arrest in Rome.
00:11:28 In what sense did Paul’s tribulations
00:11:31 “mean glory” for the Ephesians?
00:11:34 In that his perseverance in ministering despite trials
00:11:37 showed the congregation that the privileges they enjoyed as Christians
00:11:41 were of the highest importance.
00:11:43 If Paul had just given up, what would that have implied?
00:11:48 That their faith, their ministry,
00:11:50 and their hope in God’s Kingdom were not so valuable after all.
00:11:54 Instead, Paul’s endurance exalted Christianity.
00:11:58 It demonstrated that remaining faithful is worth any sacrifice.
00:12:03 In like manner, the endurance of our dear brothers and sisters in prison
00:12:07 proves that their hope is alive
00:12:10 and that the Kingdom they represent is real.
00:12:13 They have an identity as envoys,
00:12:17 not of any human government,
00:12:19 but of the heavenly Kingdom
00:12:21 —a Kingdom that will reward them with everlasting life
00:12:25 in a world without war.

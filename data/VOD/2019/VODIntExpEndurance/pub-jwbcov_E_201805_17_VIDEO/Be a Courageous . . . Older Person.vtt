I first learned about the Bible

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:07.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a friend in my second year of high school.

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became convinced that the Bible’s record

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah God’s existence was the truth.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided I wanted to serve him

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:20.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the rest of my life
and decided not to go to college.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family was very angry with my decision,

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially my uncle who was a doctor.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He burned my clothes and my identification card,

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he beat me for many hours.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no choice but to run away.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I ended up in a city far away,

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I was able to find a Kingdom Hall.

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters there
showed me warm hospitality.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized that year when I was 19.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In January of 1971,
my wife and I were assigned to the circuit work

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and we were enjoying it—

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when unexpectedly my wife became seriously ill.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had to receive immediate medical attention.

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, because of her condition,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to discontinue our service for a time.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so grateful to Jehovah,
who supported us in ways

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond our imagination during that difficult time.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In March 2015,

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of low blood pressure,

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I fell and hit my head
in the parking lot of our apartment.

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:28.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we have no children,
some might wonder who came to our aid.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we arrived at the emergency room,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers from many congregations
were already there waiting for us

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before our ambulance arrived.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are still truly grateful for their support.

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are convinced that Jehovah

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has always been with us these past decades.

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we are certain

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter what the situation,
he will always protect us

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:56.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and guide us through any tribulation,

00:01:56.303 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any hardship, or any difficulty that may arise.

00:00:01 Phelicity was a bright, vibrant little girl.
00:00:06 She was a beautiful kid —she really was.
00:00:08 She embraced the fact that she was ill.
00:00:11 She was confident and courageous,
00:00:14 knowing that Jehovah would resurrect her.
00:00:17 Phelicity really enjoyed the privilege
00:00:21 of being invited to share in the February broadcast of 2016.
00:00:26 But sadly, just a few weeks later, Phelicity passed away.
00:00:30 When you watch a child die in her mother’s arms,
00:00:34 it’s the most saddening thing you’ll ever see.
00:00:39 The pain and the sting of death is so strong.
00:00:45 But after some time, as time goes by,
00:00:49 the sting starts to fade a little bit into,
00:00:52 ‘I just really miss that person.’
00:00:55 Simple things like setting the table
00:00:58 —that’s when you need courage.
00:01:00 There’s one less plate, one less fork, one less knife,
00:01:03 one less seat.
00:01:05 On the day that Phelicity died,
00:01:07 the account of Jairus’ daughter actually helped Ben and I as parents.
00:01:10 At that moment,
00:01:12 when he was told that his daughter had died,
00:01:17 I know how he felt.
00:01:19 And yet Jesus said: ‘Do not fear.’
00:01:23 His daughter wasn’t dead.
00:01:26 She was just asleep.
00:01:28 After Phelicity died, we went to the very next meeting.
00:01:33 Many of our friends —they didn’t know what to say.
00:01:36 But they did the most important thing ever —they offered a warm embrace.
00:01:41 The friends in our Kingdom Hall are like family to us.
00:01:44 They really protected us; they comforted us.
00:01:47 Sometimes, there would be cards.
00:01:49 The hardest thing for us to do after Phelicity died
00:01:53 was to look at the resurrection hope during our family worship.
00:01:57 Our children lost their sister and their friend.
00:01:59 We were able to see the benefit,
00:02:02 especially when we heard their private prayers at nighttime.
00:02:05 They would make expressions about the resurrection hope,
00:02:09 and how they knew that Phelicity was safe in Jehovah’s memory.
00:02:12 Phelicity often said that she felt  the best when she was in the ministry
00:02:17 because she didn’t focus on her own illness.
00:02:20 And since she’s died, we can truly understand what she meant by that.
00:02:24 Our experience with losing Phelicity
00:02:28 has actually given us the ability to comfort other people.
00:02:31 So when we’re in the field and we meet people who have lost someone they love,
00:02:34 we feel better equipped emotionally and spiritually
00:02:38 to be able to strengthen others.
00:02:42 The expansion of our ministry has been something that we’ve really enjoyed.
00:02:46 It keeps our minds occupied and keeps the hope more real to us.
00:02:51 Of course, there’s always a pain
00:02:54 that won’t go away until we get Phelicity back.
00:02:57 But we put it in its place.
00:02:59 We allow it to energize our family to do the things that Jehovah wants us to do.
00:03:06 The resurrection hope is real; it’s going to happen.
00:03:09 We just have to be patient.

00:00:03 When our little daughter, Belen, was nearly three years old,
00:00:09 the doctors discovered that she had a brain tumor.
00:00:16 When her physical condition worsened,
00:00:19 as a father, I had to make decisions
00:00:21 on what kind of treatment she would receive to best take care of her.
00:00:27 And that completely terrified me.
00:00:31 It was like having Goliath
00:00:34 in front of me, and I felt desperate for a moment.
00:00:39 I remember that inside
00:00:42 I shouted to Jehovah to help me.
00:00:46 Through that situation,
00:00:48 I learned how to pray to Jehovah,
00:00:51 and Jehovah never left me.
00:00:54 Jehovah guided me.
00:00:56 Jehovah helped me make good decisions.
00:01:01 Only through prayer
00:01:03 did I understand
00:01:05 that what we were facing was too much for us to handle alone.
00:01:08 We needed Jehovah
00:01:10 more than ever.
00:01:14 As a family, we focused on our spiritual routine.
00:01:20 The key to not being afraid of these problems
00:01:24 is to trust in the resurrection hope.
00:01:30 My wife and I were determined to educate our girls with love
00:01:36 and also in a way that they would truly
00:01:38 get to know Jehovah as they grew up.
00:01:42 It was evident that we were leaning on Jehovah,
00:01:45 and they did the same.
00:01:49 Belen, when she was going through difficult circumstances,
00:01:52 she would say to me: “Don’t worry, Mom.
00:01:55 I prayed to Jehovah already!”
00:01:57 It made me see that, OK,
00:02:00 my daughter is seeing Jehovah as so real.
00:02:03 There were many moments where she strengthened me.
00:02:09 And even though it’s true that Belen fell asleep in death,
00:02:13 for me she came out victorious
00:02:16 because I know she’s going
00:02:19 to open her eyes in the new world,
00:02:21 and the four of us will be together again.

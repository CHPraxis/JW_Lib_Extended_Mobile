My husband did not recognize me for three days.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very dark time.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to BSCC,
Bible School for Christian Couples,

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in January of 2014.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It definitely helped prepare us

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for everything that would come our way

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the good and the bad.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned to Jackson, Alabama.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a great assignment.

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within a very short time,
we were asked to apply for LDC.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We traveled quite a bit,
looking at different Assembly Halls,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the focus went more
toward Kingdom Halls.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each field rep couple was assigned a state,

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were assigned the state of Louisiana.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On a Sunday night,
we had been invited to a dinner party.

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a normal—
We went to bed at night.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We basically woke up to a stroke.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I walked over to him,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could see that something was wrong,
and so I called 911.

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:06.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once they assessed him, they brought me in.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told me that they
needed to Life Flight him

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a larger hospital in New Orleans.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully, though,
they said that if you’re going to have a stroke,

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:17.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was the kind you’d want to have

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is fully recoverable.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made adjustments.

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We adapted so that we
could continue in the assignment.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he went from being in a wheelchair

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to using a walker.

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then later,
he started using a cane,

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he walks without assistance.

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a pretty walk,
but we’re working on that.

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She really has a durability

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I think excels all.

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just the way that she

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:53.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter what the situation,
how stressful the circumstance may be—

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she understands it’s necessary
for her to continue forward.

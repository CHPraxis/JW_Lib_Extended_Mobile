00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:09.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in the city of Gorlovka,

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the east of Ukraine.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking about the day I was arrested,
I did not think anything like that

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could happen to me.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was going to a field service meeting.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I was passing a train station,

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was asked by a military officer
to show my documents.

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I showed my passport.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then suddenly, he said, “Open your bag!”

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the bag I had my Bible

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and The Watchtower magazines.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrested me but not because

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my documents were missing.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They simply said:
“Believer, you are our prisoner.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to the basement.”

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I got there, the first thing I did

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was silently pray to Jehovah.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strengthened me a lot.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The smell was terrible—dirty, smoky.

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stunk!

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no space,
not even if everybody lay on their side.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day we were given

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only a few pieces of bread and water.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the detainees

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to incite everyone to escape.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took him out,
and from behind the door

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could only hear the sound

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the beating and his cries of pain.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was led back,
he was severely beaten.

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, all became silent,

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nobody complained anymore.

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say that they kept us in a state of fear.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One detainee said,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I would like to address God,
but I don’t know how to pray.”

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I volunteered and said, “I can pray.”

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I sang song 134.

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:25.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I preached a little
to the detainees and to the guards.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten days passed,
and then I was released.

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave me my bag

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said, “You are free now.”

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they were releasing me,

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one guard asked me to give him a magazine.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt joy that even the situation
I found myself in

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served for spreading the good news.

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A while ago, we were
discussing politics in social science class.

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher asked the class

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who we would vote for.

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:17.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could see what was coming,
so I offered a prayer to Jehovah.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:19.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she also stopped at my desk.

00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I simply answered

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I don’t vote.

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher looked at me all surprised

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but didn’t really know what to say,
so she just carried on.

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:33.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I felt very relieved and happy
because I had said what I needed to say.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But instead of leaving it at that, she came back

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:39.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked me why I don’t vote.

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:42.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started to explain that governments

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will never bring lasting peace,
no matter how sincerely they try.

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s when I told them
about God’s Kingdom.

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:53.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of being quiet, my classmates
started asking question after question like:

00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:55.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So when will God’s Kingdom come then?”

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “What is the Kingdom?”

00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never expected they would ask 
so many questions and be so interested.

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:05.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was a really nice surprise for me as well.

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was slightly starting to panic,
for I wasn’t sure what to say

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to explain it all properly.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of a sudden,
the idea came to me to show the video.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feeling a bit more confident,
I told the class that I had a video

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would explain exactly
what God’s Kingdom is.

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:30.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the students seemed enthusiastic
and wanted to see it.

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I got up and walked to the computer,
but it wasn’t working.

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:38.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so disappointed, for I really had the feeling

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that, apparently, I didn’t know how.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found it hard to explain, but the video could.

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now there was no way to show them.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some of my classmates
didn’t give up so easily.

00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked me, “Isn’t there another way

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still watch the video?”

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had really become interested.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, I came up with the idea to add
it to our school’s group app for the class.

00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they liked it.

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I did that.

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:06.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Almost at once I received a reply from a student,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wasn’t in my social science class, asking,

00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So when will God’s Kingdom come then?”

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:15.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here I am thinking, ‘How should I respond?’

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When, before I could even reply,

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:21.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another girl—also not in my
social science class—answers,

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, you should have watched the whole video,

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:25.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for then you would have seen that you need

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Good News brochure.”

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the end, I didn’t have to say or do anything.

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People were responding for me.

00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:34.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later on, I also heard two girls

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:37.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about God’s Kingdom,
even though I’d never spoken

00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:39.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to them about it nor sent them anything.

00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was pretty special too.

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:45.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t call myself a talkative person.

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When in a crowd, I prefer to stay
in the background and not say too much.

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:54.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why I truly believe
that Jehovah gives us courage.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:57.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normally I probably would never have stood up.

00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help, I did.

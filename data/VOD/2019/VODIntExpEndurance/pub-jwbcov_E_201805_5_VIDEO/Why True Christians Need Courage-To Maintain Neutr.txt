00:00:06 I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:09 in 1975 in Zaire.
00:00:11 Zaire was under a dictatorship at that time.
00:00:14 There was only one political party,
00:00:16 and everyone was supposed to join it.
00:00:19 Therefore, a position at work also required
00:00:22 a position in the political party.
00:00:24 I refused to have anything
00:00:26 to do with these political activities.
00:00:29 One day, they asked me to be present for the flag salute.
00:00:33 I had to go and explain
00:00:35 to all the workers who had assembled
00:00:38 why I didn’t want to be there.
00:00:40 So as I set off, understandably, I prayed a lot.
00:00:44 Until then, I would just stay out of sight,
00:00:47 but on that day, everyone was very angry;
00:00:50 so I had to be present.
00:00:53 On Saturday, a man from the party came.
00:00:57 He came to the office and started to yell,
00:01:01 “Who doesn’t want to participate in political activities?”
00:01:06 He carried on talking and called everyone to come outside,
00:01:10 so everyone went outside.
00:01:13 I stayed alone in the office.
00:01:16 On the way home, I thought that maybe
00:01:19 they were going to arrest me, but they did not.
00:01:22 We went home, myself included.
00:01:28 Afterwards, besides having to face peer pressure nearly every day,
00:01:33 I was demoted.
00:01:36 One year the children didn’t attend school
00:01:38 because we didn’t have enough money
00:01:40 —even for our day-to-day needs it became difficult.
00:01:45 I didn’t neglect spiritual things.
00:01:48 I always kept busy attending the meetings,
00:01:51 participating at the meetings, in the ministry,
00:01:54 with my personal study and, even more so,
00:01:58 with my prayer to Jehovah.
00:02:00 Jehovah has blessed me because I’m still in the truth.
00:02:05 All this time, he has blessed me.
00:02:08 To be neutral is the best way
00:02:11 to show that we support Jehovah’s Kingdom
00:02:13 —apart from the preaching work, obviously.
00:02:17 Even when the government goes against our activity,
00:02:20 we shouldn’t take this as something bad or negative.
00:02:23 It can serve a purpose.
00:02:26 It can render a witness.
00:02:28 It is a witness in support of God’s Kingdom,
00:02:31 the name of Jehovah, and his authority.
00:02:34 Understanding it in that way,
00:02:36 we will rely on Jehovah.
00:02:40 Jehovah never allows something without reason.

00:00:07 Since my dedication and baptism,
00:00:09 I have been serving in a territory
00:00:11 where our work is under ban.
00:00:13 When I was serving
00:00:15 in the full-time ministry,
00:00:17 I was assigned as a special pioneer to the territory
00:00:20 where my future husband had been serving.
00:00:22 Then we got married,  and now we are sharing
00:00:25 in this special avenue of service together.
00:00:28 We are persecuted, put on probation,
00:00:31 and confronted by government officials.
00:00:34 In difficult times,  Jehovah personally assures me
00:00:37 with the words from Isaiah:
00:00:39 “I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.”
00:00:45 The last time  government officials came to our place,
00:00:48 they took us to their office for questioning.
00:00:56 They said they had no choice,  and we went in their car.
00:01:00 At that moment, I felt that Jehovah
00:01:04 was not only giving me his holy spirit and wisdom
00:01:07 but also giving me the physical strength to go.
00:01:10 I was so thankful to him.
00:01:13 Indeed, on that day when we were taken in the car,
00:01:17 I prayed to Jehovah,
00:01:19 “Please help us to be able to give a witness about you.”
00:01:22 A government official even said these words:
00:01:26 “It’s very interesting for us to talk with you.
00:01:29 “When we talk with people of other faiths,
00:01:32 “we never have our questions fully answered.
00:01:35 “But you know  the correct answers to our questions
00:01:39 and are capable of giving them.”
00:01:41 Isaiah 31:5 is a big help
00:01:44 because there Jehovah is described
00:01:46 as being “like swooping birds.”
00:01:48 After all, Jehovah is above me.
00:01:50 In this verse he also promises that he will defend and save.
00:01:56 Encounters with government officials and discussions with them
00:01:59 have brought many blessings for our brothers,
00:02:02 for our Bible students, and for us.
00:02:04 But it has been  a good opportunity for policemen too,
00:02:07 because there are sincere ones among them who have a lot of questions.
00:02:11 We have had good discussions,
00:02:13 and I began to view them as my return visits.
00:02:17 We have shared with our students how Jehovah is giving us strength,
00:02:21 and how he is blessing us  when we are talking with government officials.
00:02:26 As a result, they are able to stay strong in the faith.
00:02:30 After meeting with the police, we never sit at home trembling in fear.
00:02:35 On the contrary, we try to share in field service with our brothers and sisters
00:02:40 even more because it’s also an encouragement for them.
00:02:43 We spend a lot of time sharing with them
00:02:46 how Jehovah glorifies his name.
00:02:50 In certain situations,  through his words in the Psalms,
00:02:53 Jehovah shows me that he is on my side,
00:02:56 and I fully believe it.
00:02:59 Jehovah indeed is on my side,
00:03:02 and he has shown me  that people can do nothing to me.
00:03:27 We participated in the construction when the Kingdom Hall was
00:03:31 built the first time.
00:03:33 Everything was finished very nicely.
00:03:39 Then we were involved in the construction
00:03:41 of the same Kingdom Hall the second time.
00:03:43 And when we were close to the end of the construction
00:03:46 and came to the construction site and saw everything burned-out and ruined,
00:03:50 we cried.
00:03:55 So almost every day, unfriendly neighbors stopped us
00:03:58 and continued to say to us: “Stop your work.
00:04:02 Go out from our village.”
00:04:07 In those moments, I just used to pray silently to Jehovah.
00:04:12 I was a bit afraid since I still had fresh in my mind all the memories,
00:04:16 the difficulties, and how the neighbors threw stones at us.
00:04:23 But the words in Isaiah 41:10 gave me strength:
00:04:28 “Do not be afraid, for I am with you.
00:04:31 “Do not be anxious, for I am your God.
00:04:33 I will fortify you, . . . I will really hold on to you with my right hand.”
00:04:37 Reading these words
00:04:40 always gave us power to continue in our service.
00:04:43 I reflected on the words in Nehemiah 2:17:
00:04:48 “Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
00:04:51 so that this disgrace will not continue.”
00:04:54 Jehovah wants this Kingdom Hall to be.
00:04:57 This is important to the people there,
00:04:59 so I wanted the praise for Jehovah, again.
00:05:03 It was more than clear that Jehovah was backing us.
00:05:06 We finished construction of that same
00:05:09 Kingdom Hall for the third time from the floor to the roof in 45 days.
00:05:14 From a human standpoint, this was not possible.
00:05:18 We worked closely with many elders and ministerial servants.
00:05:24 It was an enjoyable experience.
00:05:28 We felt Jehovah’s hand.
00:05:30 Jehovah strengthened our spirit.
00:05:35 He encouraged us, and we felt it.
00:05:39 We cannot be silent; we have to praise God.
00:05:43 We see him.
00:05:45 We know him.
00:05:46 Jehovah poured out his holy spirit,
00:05:50 and we gained confidence that Jehovah
00:05:53 is always near and ready to help.
00:05:56 He is like a loving Father holding us by our hands.
00:06:01 Endurance helped us to receive
00:06:03 all the blessings we are experiencing now.
00:06:08 I am very grateful to Jehovah God for all these blessings.
00:06:14 I realize more fully that
00:06:16 for his name, Jehovah becomes anything he wants.

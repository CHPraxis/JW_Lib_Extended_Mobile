They said, “You’ve got to go to Alaska

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of the greatest assignments
that you can be provided from the branch.”

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he popped up with the question,

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said,
“Have you ever thought of going to Alaska?”

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we said,
“Well, should we?”

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We definitely had to pray about it

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, Scripturally, look up some things.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we talked to two couples
that we knew that had served in Alaska.

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re assigned to the people,
and if you focus on that,

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you’ll find joy
in your assignment no matter where it is.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also like the spirit of Isaiah

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah asks: “Whom shall I send?”

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:44.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without a hesitation,

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah pipes up: “Here I am! Send me!”

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was just willing to be sent.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there were the logistics of figuring out

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:56.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to simplify and how to actually get up there.

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It definitely takes courage to take an assignment

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you’re out of your comfort zone.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might have needed some courage
for the assignment that we took,

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were so impressed with the courage
that the other brothers demonstrated.

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were a total 
of 16 different special pioneers

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were assigned,

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 6 of them
had never experienced a winter,

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re being sent
into the harshest of climates

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the harshest of winters in northern Alaska.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we saw these young men,
without hesitation,

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going to very unique places
out of their comfort zone

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it inspired us.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wasn’t just a harsh climate,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was darkness, no congregation—

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—isolation—

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—none of their friends, none of their family there.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would get a taxi cab to drive them

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:50.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the farthest part
of their territory for that particular day,

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:54.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drop them off,
and then they would work from that location

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:56.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back to their hotel.

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say that one
of the blessings that we enjoyed

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was seeing how Jehovah
opened up the language group.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:05.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah chose the right ones

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:09.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the first tract
translated into the Yupik language.

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the sisters who was asked to translate

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was intimidated because she did not know
how to read or write the language.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contemplating Noah gave her the courage

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill her assignment
because she, like Noah, “did just so.”

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the scripture
that says ‘the blessings of Jehovah,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is what makes rich.’

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is so true.

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could have stayed
in Jersey in our little apartment,

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even by now have a comfortable living.

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what really makes life worth living
is the people and friends you have.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:46.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As it was once said,
“You can’t outgive Jehovah.”

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone is considering going through a door

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has opened up for them,

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t hesitate.

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got the support of Jehovah,

00:02:55.988 --> 00:03:00.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unseen angels, His spirit, and the brotherhood.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the blessings are just waiting for you.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On one occasion,
my son called me on the phone and said:

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Dad, come quickly!

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They kidnapped John!”

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During a midweek meeting,

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three armed men
showed up at the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:25.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They threatened to harm the brothers,

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their families, or the congregation

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless they received
a considerable sum of money.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got to the Kingdom Hall,

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I opened the car door,
a kidnapper was there waiting for me.

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took me 
to an abandoned lot and left me there,

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they took my car.

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s dangerous to preach
in many parts of Mexico City,

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since we’re in danger
of being robbed at gunpoint.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, I once witnessed a shooting.

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband has been mugged.

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:02.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These kinds of things
don’t happen just in Mexico;

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:04.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they happen all over the world.

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the meetings,
we had as many as 20 attendants

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:13.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the doors of the Kingdom Hall
so that the congregation would feel safe.

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the meeting starts, the doors are closed.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we keep on the lookout,
and if somebody wants to come in,

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we make sure that they will not pose
a threat to the congregation.

00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:27.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re preaching from house to house,

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we try to stay together as a group.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re aware of our surroundings,

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching out for any dangers.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re always holding publications,

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a magazine or a Bible.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us because people identify us
as Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:45.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try not to have any valuables on me,
like a cell phone or jewelry.

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very productive territory
even though it is such a dangerous area.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of people are coming to know Jehovah.

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:57.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I was in the car with the kidnapper,

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:01.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he asked me what the difference
is between Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christians.

00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:07.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know I would have
the opportunity to preach, but I did.

00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I greatly admire the sisters that go out in service

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:18.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the courage they show—

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:22.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because even though their territories
are difficult, dangerous,

00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will not give up in this important work.

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For them, giving up is not an option.

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:30.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I will never give up either.

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Crime happens and will continue to happen.

00:05:36.064 --> 00:05:40.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re determined to serve Jehovah,
no matter what.

00:05:40.068 --> 00:05:43.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should not be afraid
of those who kill the body.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were to face this situation again,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation would not stop preaching.

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:51.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They love Jehovah so much.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they truly understand that their neighbors

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also suffering from crime,

00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:59.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they put forth much effort
to share a message of hope.

00:05:59.922 --> 00:06:02.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I will not stop preaching.

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:04.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work must go on

00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:07.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether there’s violence or not.

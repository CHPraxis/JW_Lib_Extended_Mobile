The persecution spread throughout Malawi

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soon after the announcement was made

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:13.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Witnesses were banned in the country.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their houses were burned,

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their maize crops were confiscated

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they refused to participate 
in the country’s politics.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The regular visits that Brother Johansson

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was doing as a branch representative at that time

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:47.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really encouraged the brothers 
from various parts of the country

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were affected by the persecution.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wife, Linda,

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suggested that he should ask
someone to accompany him

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he did not have to do the work alone.

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she suggested that I accompany him.

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was because of the fear
of what might happen.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:12.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got to the ferry crossing,

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the soldiers told Brother Johansson 
to get out and stand in front of the jeep.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said to me, “You can pass,

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we first have to shoot the white man.”

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Scriptures say:

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one has greater love than this,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone should surrender
his life in behalf of his friends,”

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said:

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shoot me instead!

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:38.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did this man do?”

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it happened
without me giving it a second thought.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just happened spontaneously.

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stood between him and the soldiers.

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer helped very much

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the people
that we thought were going to harm us

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a complete change of heart.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the way back,
Brother Johansson also saved my life.

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were stopped by a youth mob at a roadblock.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked for the political cards.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would have killed me.

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Brother Johansson
just sped off with his vehicle.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it was very exciting to see

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God
has many ways of saving his people.

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha said:

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For there are more who are with us

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than those who are with them.”

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, Jehovah will rescue his people.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in countries where our brothers are banned,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I encourage them to stand firm,

00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting in God
—the God who never fails, Jehovah.

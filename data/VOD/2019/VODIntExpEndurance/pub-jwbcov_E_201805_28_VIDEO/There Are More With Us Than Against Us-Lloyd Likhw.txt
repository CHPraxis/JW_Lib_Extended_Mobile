00:00:03 The persecution spread throughout Malawi
00:00:06 soon after the announcement was made
00:00:09 that the Witnesses were banned in the country.
00:00:26 Their houses were burned,
00:00:28 and their maize crops were confiscated
00:00:31 because they refused to participate  in the country’s politics.
00:00:36 The regular visits that Brother Johansson
00:00:38 was doing as a branch representative at that time
00:00:42 really encouraged the brothers  from various parts of the country
00:00:47 who were affected by the persecution.
00:00:50 His wife, Linda,
00:00:53 suggested that he should ask someone to accompany him
00:00:57 so that he did not have to do the work alone.
00:01:00 And she suggested that I accompany him.
00:01:04 This was because of the fear of what might happen.
00:01:09 When we got to the ferry crossing,
00:01:12 the soldiers told Brother Johansson  to get out and stand in front of the jeep.
00:01:18 They said to me, “You can pass,
00:01:20 but we first have to shoot the white man.”
00:01:24 Because the Scriptures say:
00:01:27 “No one has greater love than this,
00:01:29 that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends,”
00:01:32 I said:
00:01:34 “Shoot me instead!
00:01:36 What did this man do?”
00:01:39 Yes, it happened without me giving it a second thought.
00:01:43 It just happened spontaneously.
00:01:45 I stood between him and the soldiers.
00:01:52 Prayer helped very much
00:01:55 because the people that we thought were going to harm us
00:01:58 had a complete change of heart.
00:02:04 On the way back, Brother Johansson also saved my life.
00:02:08 We were stopped by a youth mob at a roadblock.
00:02:11 They asked for the political cards.
00:02:13 They would have killed me.
00:02:16 So Brother Johansson just sped off with his vehicle.
00:02:20 Yes, it was very exciting to see
00:02:23 that Jehovah God has many ways of saving his people.
00:02:27 Elisha said:
00:02:29 “For there are more who are with us
00:02:32 than those who are with them.”
00:02:35 In the end, Jehovah will rescue his people.
00:02:39 So in countries where our brothers are banned,
00:02:42 I encourage them to stand firm,
00:02:45 trusting in God —the God who never fails, Jehovah.

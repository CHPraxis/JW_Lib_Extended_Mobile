00:00:05 One afternoon as we were going to our meeting,
00:00:07 I was robbed by a couple of thieves
00:00:10 —young men.
00:00:13 But right away, there at home,
00:00:15 we realized that the best thing to do was to go to the meeting anyway.
00:00:19 We just had to go to the meeting.
00:00:22 It didn’t make any sense to stay at home crying
00:00:25 and feeling all negative and frustrated.
00:00:30 At the Kingdom Hall you feel refreshed.
00:00:32 It’s a safe place and you feel at peace.
00:00:37 Your thoughts calm down,
00:00:39 and those terrible feelings caused by being a victim
00:00:42 of the bad things that happen in this system dissipate.
00:00:47 This was the third vehicle I’d had as a taxi driver.
00:00:53 It was a really big blow financially.
00:00:56 The brothers found out that I had lost my means of living.
00:01:00 I no longer had an income.
00:01:02 And while I was wondering what to do,
00:01:05 they began to attend to each of our needs.
00:01:14 David, my son —he left to go on a Bible study
00:01:18 with another brother from the congregation.
00:01:23 But less than half an hour later,
00:01:25 I got a call from the brother who was with him.
00:01:28 He gave me the terrible news that my son had been run over.
00:01:32 Well, when we got to where he was being treated,
00:01:34 there were many brothers there already —many brothers.
00:01:38 To this day, I can’t figure out how they got there so quickly.
00:01:42 Who called them?
00:01:43 How did they find out?
00:01:45 Our son’s accident was so distressing.
00:01:48 Our hearts took a beating.
00:01:52 As my heart was aching,
00:01:54 it was as if Jehovah took my heart in his hand
00:01:57 and caressed it:
00:01:59 ‘Don’t you worry. Calm down.
00:02:02 ‘Everything will be all right.
00:02:05 ‘Just keep calm.
00:02:07 ‘You’ve suffered a test, but now you will see my hand in this.
00:02:12 ‘I won’t be coming down to be with you personally,
00:02:15 but look at all that’s happening.’
00:02:17 And we saw Jehovah’s power.
00:02:20 I’m not saying that it was good that it happened,
00:02:23 but it is important to see how Jehovah takes care of things.
00:02:27 Not a year passed by between the theft of my car
00:02:30 and my son’s accident.
00:02:32 The brothers were always there for us
00:02:36 —a greeting, a hearty handshake, a meaningful, “We’re right here, brother.”
00:02:41 And often there was something in that handshake
00:02:44 —money for things we needed at that moment.
00:02:47 Thanks to Jehovah,
00:02:49 my wife, my son, and I feel very happy
00:02:52 and amazed by all the good things
00:02:55 Jehovah does for us each day.
00:02:57 I want to take hold of Jehovah’s hand.
00:03:00 I concentrate on that and pray every day
00:03:02 to be able to cope with whatever problems arise.
00:03:05 And another important thing: I know that I can count on my friends.
00:03:09 I don’t have to face things alone.
00:03:26 I had a comfortable economic situation.
00:03:29 For 20 years I worked as the supervisor of a firm
00:03:32 contracted by the oil industry.
00:03:35 My family of five
00:03:37 —made up of my wife, my three daughters, and myself—
00:03:40 never had to worry about food.
00:03:42 One afternoon, as I watched the news on television,
00:03:46 I learned that the company I worked for
00:03:48 had come under new management.
00:03:53 That Monday, when I went to work,
00:03:55 I arrived at my office and found the new supervisor sitting in my chair
00:04:00 that I had occupied for 20 years.
00:04:04 I saw my résumé in his hand.
00:04:07 He congratulated me for being a hard worker
00:04:09 who was honest and productive,
00:04:12 but he said there was just one thing missing:
00:04:15 I needed to join a political party.
00:04:20 I replied as tactfully as I could
00:04:23 that my wife and I were Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:04:25 and that we were neutral in political matters.
00:04:28 The mood quickly deteriorated.
00:04:30 Visibly angered,
00:04:32 the supervisor’s facial expression and tone of voice changed,
00:04:35 and he threatened me, saying that if I did not join the political party,
00:04:39 then that would be my last day at work.
00:04:42 I did not sign it or join the political party,
00:04:45 because that would be like committing adultery
00:04:48 and keeping quiet about it.
00:04:51 I would feel as if I had betrayed Jehovah.
00:04:54 I could have signed it and kept my old job,
00:04:57 but I knew my conscience would bother me for the rest of my life.
00:05:03 I would never be able to go to the congregation
00:05:06 and serve as an elder knowing that I had let Jehovah down.
00:05:11 Suddenly, I was unemployed.
00:05:14 I lost 20 years of work and the severance and seniority pay I was due.
00:05:20 My wife and my daughters were waiting for me.
00:05:23 And right then and there,
00:05:25 we prayed together  and asked Jehovah to please provide for us,
00:05:30 to please not let us be tempted beyond what we could bear.
00:05:34 We knew that we were facing a huge test,
00:05:36 but that we would prevail
00:05:38 because we had been obedient to Jehovah.
00:05:43 Since losing my job, I’ve done several different odd jobs
00:05:46 like gardening and painting houses,
00:05:48 and at present, I work with public transportation.
00:05:52 My daughter, Genesaret, the second oldest,
00:05:55 paints pictures, and we sell them.
00:05:58 My wife makes food and homemade sweets,
00:06:01 and we have learned other skills as well.
00:06:04 We have greatly simplified our life.
00:06:07 My wife and I were even invited to pioneer school in 2014.
00:06:14 Our two older daughters auxiliary pioneer from time to time,
00:06:17 and our youngest daughter, who is 13, was baptized.
00:06:21 Jehovah has never let us down.

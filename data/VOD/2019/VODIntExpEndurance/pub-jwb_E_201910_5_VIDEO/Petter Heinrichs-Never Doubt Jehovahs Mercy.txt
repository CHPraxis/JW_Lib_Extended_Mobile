00:00:09 My first contact with the Witnesses was in my 20’s.
00:00:17 As my knowledge increased, I made drastic changes.
00:00:21 I quit smoking and stopped swearing and using drugs.
00:00:24 I also changed my violent behavior.
00:00:27 I completely gave up martial arts,
00:00:29 and then I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:33 It was an amazing day that I will never forget.
00:00:43 Shortly after my baptism,
00:00:45 I became quite involved in my work at the theater.
00:00:48 The environment there was very immoral, you know.
00:00:52 Even after several loving warnings
00:00:54 from brothers in the congregation advising me to look for another job,
00:00:58 I chose not to follow their advice.
00:01:00 I’d worked there for a long time,
00:01:02 so I thought, ‘I can handle it.’
00:01:05 But I was wrong.
00:01:07 My conscience became dull,
00:01:10 and I committed a serious sin against Jehovah.
00:01:18 When I left the truth,
00:01:20 several offers came my way.
00:01:22 I became a manager at a nightclub that was open until six in the morning.
00:01:26 It was a lot of parties, and it was a lot of drugs.
00:01:36 I also resumed martial arts.
00:01:40 I came in contact with serious criminals
00:01:43 and gradually became friends with the most influential person
00:01:46 in the criminal underworld in Oslo.
00:01:51 Eventually, I was imprisoned for my violent behavior.
00:01:58 A Christian movement visited the prison where I was,
00:02:02 and all of the inmates were invited to an event where there would be cake served.
00:02:07 That sounded very interesting.
00:02:09 I was tempted by a cake.
00:02:11 They also played music.
00:02:14 But after a while,  they started speaking in tongues,
00:02:18 and I felt very uncomfortable.
00:02:21 I didn’t want to be involved in that, but I couldn’t get up.
00:02:24 Even though I was big and strong back then,
00:02:27 I physically couldn’t stand up from my chair.
00:02:30 I’ve experienced a lot in my life,
00:02:32 but at that moment, I was genuinely scared.
00:02:36 So I cried out to Jehovah, and immediately I was released,
00:02:41 and I was able to get up and leave.
00:02:44 This big man was now in a fetal position, crying.
00:02:50 And then I called my wife and asked her to bring me a Bible
00:02:55 and some literature.
00:02:56 I had to start studying again and draw close to Jehovah.
00:03:04 The greatest challenge was prayer
00:03:07 —to start communicating with Jehovah again after being so far away from him,
00:03:12 doing all these bad things.
00:03:14 You know, it was a long way to go.
00:03:19 One scripture I especially remember
00:03:22 is Isaiah 1:18, where He says:
00:03:25 “Come, now, and let us set matters straight between us.”
00:03:30 That touched me deeply.
00:03:34 He also says that if ‘your sins are red like scarlet,’
00:03:39 Jehovah will make them “white as snow.”
00:03:44 It felt like he separated the darkness and stretched out his hand
00:03:48 and pulled me out, back into the light again.
00:03:58 Six months after I was reinstated,
00:04:00 my wife decided to dedicate her life
00:04:03 to Jehovah and was baptized.
00:04:08 She has been a huge support during my return.
00:04:13 I was very nervous at first,
00:04:17 but when I entered the Kingdom Hall,
00:04:20 that feeling just disappeared.
00:04:23 God’s spirit is here.
00:04:25 The way the brothers and sisters acted toward each other
00:04:29 was such a contrast to my former lifestyle.
00:04:36 We feel deeply blessed by Jehovah.
00:04:42 Of course, you make mistakes once in a while,
00:04:45 but now I feel confident that Jehovah is merciful.

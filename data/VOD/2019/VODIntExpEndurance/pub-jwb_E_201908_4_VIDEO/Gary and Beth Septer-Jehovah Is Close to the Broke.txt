00:00:04 God’s Word says:
00:00:07 “Remember, then, your Grand Creator
00:00:09 “in the days of your youth,
00:00:11 before the days of distress come.”
00:00:15 And “the days of distress”
00:00:17 —they arrived early on Jerod at 11.
00:00:21 Jerod was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.
00:00:27 We started trying to figure out how we could get him
00:00:30 the treatment that he needed, of course, but in no way would we accept
00:00:33 a blood transfusion, and neither would Jerod.
00:00:36 When Jerod was in the hospital, Child Protective Services
00:00:41 did investigate us.
00:00:42 They were concerned there was negligence.
00:00:44 It was just adding to the pain.
00:00:47 The way it turned out, they backed completely away from that.
00:00:51 They realized that we hadn’t been negligent.
00:00:53 So as we faced different situations, we’d pray at the time,
00:00:57 not to have miraculous answers,
00:01:00 but for Jehovah to open our eyes and to be able to find things.
00:01:04 And it seemed as though he was really directing us,
00:01:08 so that we could take care of ourselves spiritually
00:01:11 through this situation as well as take care of Jerod’s medical needs.
00:01:16 I remember
00:01:18 many times falling on my knees
00:01:21 and praying and thinking: ‘This is it.
00:01:24 I’m tested beyond what I can bear.’
00:01:27 And Jehovah would strengthen me.
00:01:29 And someone would come,
00:01:31 or they would say something.
00:01:34 And they fed us.
00:01:36 The brother made a schedule, and he said,
00:01:39 “You’re going to feed these friends.”
00:01:41 And the brother’s instructions were:
00:01:43 “You don’t bring it and just drop off the food.
00:01:45 You stay with those friends.”
00:01:47 It made me cry
00:01:50 —the love and the care that we experienced.
00:01:52 One time, I remember
00:01:54 the hallways of this hospital
00:01:56 —1,500 miles (2,400 km) away from our home—
00:01:59 started filling up with people.
00:02:02 To me, that was answering prayers too.
00:02:06 It was hard for us to get out of the hospital,
00:02:09 so they recorded talks.
00:02:10 They would look us in the eye, and they’d say:
00:02:13 “Now, you need to listen to this.
00:02:15 It will keep you strong.”
00:02:18 Jerod was worried about us, and he made it clear
00:02:21 that he was going to be fine.
00:02:24 He just didn’t know if we were going to be.
00:02:26 He died
00:02:29 in June of 1992.
00:02:32 He was at home.
00:02:35 And the last thing he said to us was,
00:02:38 “Work hard so we can all be together again.”
00:02:50 It’s numbing
00:02:52 because it’s almost like you’re living a nightmare
00:02:55 because you never think that those things will happen to you,
00:03:03 but it did.
00:03:05 I didn’t want people to see me cry.
00:03:07 I didn’t want pity, and I didn’t—
00:03:13 Because of that
00:03:15 —those negative feelings— my imagination ran wild.
00:03:21 What helped me, I know,
00:03:24 was Gary putting into my heart and mind
00:03:28 that this is a fight.
00:03:30 It’s been a challenge for all mankind.
00:03:33 ‘If you make it hard on them, they won’t love you’
00:03:35 —Satan said that about Jehovah and individuals.
00:03:39 So I would be giving in to that.
00:03:43 The strong feelings I had
00:03:45 and my sorrow almost made me stop.
00:03:48 I prayed a lot to go back to the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:52 The congregation cried; they lost a little boy.
00:03:57 It wasn’t just Gary and Beth.
00:03:58 They lost a little boy.
00:04:00 They cried,
00:04:04 and I didn’t feel alone.
00:04:07 And then we hugged; we cried together.
00:04:13 It really benefited us to get right back
00:04:16 into spiritual focus and to get our minds off ourselves.
00:04:19 And I could’ve given in to my pain and thought,
00:04:22 ‘Well, I’m too heartbroken.’
00:04:24 It made me have more joy
00:04:26 because I realized that now they have a hope.
00:04:30 People around us were vital
00:04:32 —the support system Jehovah has—
00:04:34 and his Word, his spirit.
00:04:38 Jehovah answered those prayers.
00:04:40 Our goal was really to stay
00:04:42 in the full-time ministry (maybe doing something else),
00:04:46 but we never, ever thought we would be in the circuit work.
00:04:50 But to have our daughter working with her husband in the circuit work
00:04:54 —it’s almost hard to believe that it’s happening.
00:04:58 We look forward to seeing Jerod again, having him back with us.
00:05:01 So I’m waiting, and I know I’m not going to be disappointed.
00:05:06 How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth
00:05:09 are able to take vacation time to travel occasionally
00:05:12 to see their daughter and her husband,
00:05:15 who are also serving in the traveling work.
00:05:19 And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jerod
00:05:23 felt Jehovah’s loving support
00:05:26 as they prayed throughout this heart-wrenching trial?
00:05:31 They asked for wisdom when seeking medical treatment for Jerod.
00:05:35 Jehovah put his arms around them and listened
00:05:40 when they felt overwhelmed with grief and negative feelings.
00:05:44 He strengthened Jerod’s hope in the resurrection
00:05:48 and helped Brother and Sister Septer
00:05:51 stay spiritually strong.
00:05:53 Can there be any doubt
00:05:56 that Jehovah was answering their prayers?
00:05:59 Doesn’t that strengthen our conviction
00:06:02 that Jehovah will also answer Jerod’s prayer
00:06:06 that they all will be together again?

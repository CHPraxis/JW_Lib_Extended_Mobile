God’s Word says:

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:09.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, then, your Grand Creator

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the days of your youth,

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the days of distress come.”

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “the days of distress”

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:21.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they arrived early on Jerod at 11.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:25.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod was diagnosed
with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:30.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started trying
to figure out how we could get him

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treatment that he needed,
of course, but in no way would we accept

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a blood transfusion, and neither would Jerod.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jerod was in the hospital,
Child Protective Services

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did investigate us.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were concerned there was negligence.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just adding to the pain.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way it turned out,
they backed completely away from that.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They realized that we hadn’t been negligent.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we faced different situations,
we’d pray at the time,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to have miraculous answers,

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for Jehovah to open our eyes
and to be able to find things.

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seemed as though
he was really directing us,

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could take care
of ourselves spiritually

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through this situation as well as take care
of Jerod’s medical needs.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times falling on my knees

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying and thinking: ‘This is it.

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m tested beyond what I can bear.’

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah would strengthen me.

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someone would come,

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they would say something.

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:36.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they fed us.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:39.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother made a schedule, and he said,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to feed these friends.”

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brother’s instructions were:

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You don’t bring it
and just drop off the food.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stay with those friends.”

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me cry

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:52.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the love and the care that we experienced.

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:54.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I remember

00:01:54.798 --> 00:01:56.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hallways of this hospital

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1,500 miles (2,400 km) away from our home—

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started filling up with people.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:04.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, that was answering prayers too.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard for us
to get out of the hospital,

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they recorded talks.

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would look us in the eye,
and they’d say:

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:15.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, you need to listen to this.

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will keep you strong.”

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:21.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod was worried about us,
and he made it clear

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:24.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was going to be fine.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just didn’t know if we were going to be.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in June of 1992.

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was at home.

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the last thing he said to us was,

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Work hard so we can all be together again.”

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s numbing

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:55.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s almost like
you’re living a nightmare

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you never think
that those things will happen to you,

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it did.

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want people to see me cry.

00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:12.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want pity, and I didn’t—

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:19.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those negative feelings—
my imagination ran wild.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped me, I know,

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was Gary putting into my heart and mind

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:30.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is a fight.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a challenge for all mankind.

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you make it hard on them,
they won’t love you’

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan said that
about Jehovah and individuals.

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I would be giving in to that.

00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The strong feelings I had

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:48.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sorrow almost made me stop.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed a lot
to go back to the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:57.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation cried;
they lost a little boy.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just Gary and Beth.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:00.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They lost a little boy.

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cried,

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t feel alone.

00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we hugged; we cried together.

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really benefited us to get right back

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:19.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into spiritual focus
and to get our minds off ourselves.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could’ve given in
to my pain and thought,

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I’m too heartbroken.’

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me have more joy

00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:29.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I realized that now they have a hope.

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:32.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People around us were vital

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the support system Jehovah has—

00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Word, his spirit.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered those prayers.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal was really to stay

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:46.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the full-time ministry
(maybe doing something else),

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never, ever thought
we would be in the circuit work.

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have our daughter
working with her husband in the circuit work

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s almost hard
to believe that it’s happening.

00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to seeing Jerod again,
having him back with us.

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:06.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m waiting,
and I know I’m not going to be disappointed.

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:09.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are able to take vacation time
to travel occasionally

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see their daughter and her husband,

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are also serving in the traveling work.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:23.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jerod

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt Jehovah’s loving support

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:31.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they prayed throughout
this heart-wrenching trial?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked for wisdom
when seeking medical treatment for Jerod.

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah put his arms around them and listened

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they felt overwhelmed
with grief and negative feelings.

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:48.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He strengthened
Jerod’s hope in the resurrection

00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:51.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped Brother and Sister Septer

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay spiritually strong.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:56.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can there be any doubt

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was answering their prayers?

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that strengthen our conviction

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will also answer Jerod’s prayer

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:09.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they all will be together again?

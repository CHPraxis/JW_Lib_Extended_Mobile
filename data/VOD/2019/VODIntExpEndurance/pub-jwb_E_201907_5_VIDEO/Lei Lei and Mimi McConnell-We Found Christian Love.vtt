This is my sister Lei Lei.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my sister Mimi.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:09.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sister Lei Lei—
She is very caring.

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that for sure.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that I appreciate about Mimi

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that she has a self-sacrificing spirit.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our family.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I love most about my mom
is that she has a big heart.

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:31.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know that my dad
really, truly loves his family.

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister, Sophie, always takes care of you,
making sure you are OK.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family is something
that we never want to replace.

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To us, it’s a forever family.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t always like that.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:51.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We haven’t always been sisters.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a young age,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was already in a foster home,

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Mimi became my foster sister.

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:04.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were not treated as part of their family.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never knew what love felt like.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There wasn’t a bedroom for us.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me and Lei Lei would share a couch.

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our foster families would leave us

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by ourselves at home,

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and me and Lei Lei had to take care of ourselves.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were very close together

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we would talk to each other
and just help each other out.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we would go to school,
we didn’t have school supplies,

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I would steal stuff.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we didn’t have school uniforms;

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had clothing that was dirty.

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like in some way
that with all these experiences

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it kind of made me feel like I didn’t care.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t like authority figures
and didn’t really trust them.

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was lost.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was confused.

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just did whatever I possibly could

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect myself.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have experienced things
that no child should go through.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found out there was a family
who wanted to adopt us.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 12 years old.

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was nine years old.

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that was tough for me was conversing.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know any English,

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was hard for my parents to know how I felt

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I had a hard time
expressing if I was sad or scared.

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a difficult time trusting.

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they showed us love,

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they hugged us
and just made us feel at home.

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I got to know them better and I got to see

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they truly loved me

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:45.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they truly treated me like their daughter,

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helped me to develop love and trust.

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:52.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time I saw
my mom and dad praying at the dinner meal,

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was very new to me because I never knew

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was a God.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had some past experience with religion,
and I didn’t like it.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I first saw my mom and dad praying,

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:08.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was uncomfortable with it.

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to figure out a way

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to introduce their best Friend,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, to us.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:18.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took us to this place
called the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first thing we felt was warmth and love.

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these friends were coming up

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying hi to us and giving us hugs

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just super loving toward us.

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad would give us a notepad,

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would tell us,
“Draw anything that you understand.”

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so those were our notes.

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:39.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would just draw pictures.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would pray with us,

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaching us how to pray specifically

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see how Jehovah
could answer our prayer.

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would eat breakfast
every day together and do the daily text;

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:56.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would reenact Bible stories.

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we prepared for meetings.

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simplified Watchtower came out,
and it really helped us so much.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to really learn
more about Jehovah and understand it.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that helped me to give
more comments and draw closer to Jehovah.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A big change for me

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was during the 2014 international convention.

00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:22.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just seeing the love and the unity

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between brothers and sisters touched my heart.

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:27.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That also helped me

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to progress toward making
the decision of getting baptized.

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going out in service more—
I think it really helped me

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:39.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw closer to Jehovah
and make the Kingdom feel real to me.

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s why I wanted to get baptized.

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I graduated from high school,
I started to pioneer.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one way to show my love for Jehovah.

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to just take care of myself,

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:58.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I learned to take care of others
and to think of others first.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us young ones, we should appreciate

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every moment that we have with our parents.

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your parents are the best friends
that you could ever have.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going out in service wasn’t easy for me at first

00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I’m actually a very shy person,

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I decided to rely on Jehovah
and started pioneering.

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:19.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just recently,

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started commuting to Bethel one day a week.

00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:28.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The important quality
that Jehovah has taught me is love

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:33.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that love from my family,
from Jehovah, and from my friends.

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that it’s OK to love people,
and that’s what you are supposed to do.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:40.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You love people and take care of people.

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:45.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I feel like my life
is more satisfying and meaningful.

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:49.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meditate and think
about what Jehovah has done for me and Lei Lei,

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:51.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to be afraid.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is my “secure refuge,”
because life may change,

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah does not change.

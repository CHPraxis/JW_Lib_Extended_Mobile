00:00:01 This is my sister Lei Lei.
00:00:04 This is my sister Mimi.
00:00:06 My sister Lei Lei— She is very caring.
00:00:09 I know that for sure.
00:00:11 One thing that I appreciate about Mimi
00:00:13 is that she has a self-sacrificing spirit.
00:00:17 We love our family.
00:00:19 Yeah.
00:00:24 What I love most about my mom is that she has a big heart.
00:00:27 And I know that my dad really, truly loves his family.
00:00:32 Our sister, Sophie, always takes care of you, making sure you are OK.
00:00:36 Our family is something that we never want to replace.
00:00:39 To us, it’s a forever family.
00:00:46 But it wasn’t always like that.
00:00:49 We haven’t always been sisters.
00:00:52 At a young age,
00:00:54 I was already in a foster home,
00:00:58 and then Mimi became my foster sister.
00:01:00 We were not treated as part of their family.
00:01:04 We never knew what love felt like.
00:01:07 There wasn’t a bedroom for us.
00:01:09 Me and Lei Lei would share a couch.
00:01:12 Our foster families would leave us
00:01:14 by ourselves at home,
00:01:17 and me and Lei Lei had to take care of ourselves.
00:01:20 And so we were very close together
00:01:23 because we would talk to each other and just help each other out.
00:01:27 When we would go to school, we didn’t have school supplies,
00:01:30 so I would steal stuff.
00:01:32 And we didn’t have school uniforms;
00:01:36 we had clothing that was dirty.
00:01:38 I felt like in some way that with all these experiences
00:01:41 it kind of made me feel like I didn’t care.
00:01:43 I didn’t like authority figures and didn’t really trust them.
00:01:47 I was lost.
00:01:49 I was confused.
00:01:52 I just did whatever I possibly could
00:01:54 to protect myself.
00:01:56 We have experienced things that no child should go through.
00:02:03 We found out there was a family who wanted to adopt us.
00:02:07 I was 12 years old.
00:02:09 And I was nine years old.
00:02:11 One thing that was tough for me was conversing.
00:02:16 I didn’t know any English,
00:02:18 and it was hard for my parents to know how I felt
00:02:21 because I had a hard time expressing if I was sad or scared.
00:02:25 I had a difficult time trusting.
00:02:29 But they showed us love,
00:02:31 and they hugged us and just made us feel at home.
00:02:37 As I got to know them better and I got to see
00:02:39 that they truly loved me
00:02:41 and that they truly treated me like their daughter,
00:02:45 it helped me to develop love and trust.
00:02:48 The first time I saw my mom and dad praying at the dinner meal,
00:02:52 it was very new to me because I never knew
00:02:55 that there was a God.
00:02:58 I had some past experience with religion, and I didn’t like it.
00:03:02 So when I first saw my mom and dad praying,
00:03:05 I was uncomfortable with it.
00:03:08 They had to figure out a way
00:03:10 to introduce their best Friend,
00:03:11 Jehovah, to us.
00:03:14 They took us to this place called the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:18 The first thing we felt was warmth and love.
00:03:22 All these friends were coming up
00:03:24 and saying hi to us and giving us hugs
00:03:27 —just super loving toward us.
00:03:29 Dad would give us a notepad,
00:03:32 and he would tell us, “Draw anything that you understand.”
00:03:35 And so those were our notes.
00:03:37 We would just draw pictures.
00:03:39 They would pray with us,
00:03:42 teaching us how to pray specifically
00:03:45 and to see how Jehovah could answer our prayer.
00:03:49 We would eat breakfast every day together and do the daily text;
00:03:53 we would reenact Bible stories.
00:03:56 And we prepared for meetings.
00:04:02 The simplified Watchtower came out, and it really helped us so much.
00:04:06 I was able to really learn more about Jehovah and understand it.
00:04:11 And that helped me to give more comments and draw closer to Jehovah.
00:04:15 A big change for me
00:04:17 was during the 2014 international convention.
00:04:20 Just seeing the love and the unity
00:04:22 between brothers and sisters touched my heart.
00:04:25 That also helped me
00:04:27 to progress toward making the decision of getting baptized.
00:04:32 Going out in service more— I think it really helped me
00:04:35 to draw closer to Jehovah and make the Kingdom feel real to me.
00:04:39 And so that’s why I wanted to get baptized.
00:04:44 After I graduated from high school, I started to pioneer.
00:04:47 It’s one way to show my love for Jehovah.
00:04:52 I used to just take care of myself,
00:04:54 but I learned to take care of others and to think of others first.
00:04:58 For us young ones, we should appreciate
00:05:01 every moment that we have with our parents.
00:05:03 Your parents are the best friends that you could ever have.
00:05:06 Going out in service wasn’t easy for me at first
00:05:09 because I’m actually a very shy person,
00:05:12 but I decided to rely on Jehovah and started pioneering.
00:05:17 And just recently,
00:05:19 I started commuting to Bethel one day a week.
00:05:23 The important quality that Jehovah has taught me is love
00:05:28 I felt that love from my family, from Jehovah, and from my friends.
00:05:33 I learned that it’s OK to love people, and that’s what you are supposed to do.
00:05:37 You love people and take care of people.
00:05:40 And I feel like my life is more satisfying and meaningful.
00:05:45 When I meditate and think about what Jehovah has done for me and Lei Lei,
00:05:49 I don’t have to be afraid.
00:05:51 Jehovah is my “secure refuge,” because life may change,
00:05:55 but Jehovah does not change.

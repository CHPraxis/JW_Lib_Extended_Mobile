00:00:03 ‎I was serving at the Austria branch
00:00:06 ‎from about the mid-1970’s to 1990.
00:00:10 ‎We had a small department
00:00:13 ‎that was assigned ‎to help certain countries in Eastern Europe.
00:00:18 ‎And that included  ‎visiting the brothers under ban,
00:00:21 ‎bringing them spiritual food,
00:00:23 ‎having secret meetings with them,
00:00:25 ‎and also strengthening  ‎the local organization
00:00:28 ‎that was exposed  ‎to persecution and ban.
00:00:33 ‎We would print books on Bible paper
00:00:36 ‎in miniature size.
00:00:38 ‎This way, more books or literature
00:00:41 ‎could be taken to these countries.
00:00:44 ‎The couriers transported literature
00:00:47 ‎to these countries  ‎in their own private cars.
00:00:50 ‎This way,  ‎hundreds of books could be transported.
00:00:56 ‎At the border, if a courier
00:00:58 ‎would be found transporting literature,
00:01:01 ‎they would interrogate the driver.
00:01:04 ‎But these brothers were trained;
00:01:06 ‎they knew what to say ‎to protect the work
00:01:08 ‎and to not give away any secrets.
00:01:11 ‎Usually, after a day or two days,
00:01:14 ‎the officials would let them go back home
00:01:18 ‎to their home country  ‎but not with their car;
00:01:21 ‎they had to use public transportation
00:01:23 ‎because their cars would be confiscated.
00:01:26 ‎But the brothers had the spirit of sacrifice; ‎they were willing to risk that.
00:01:31 ‎But the majority got through, ‎and actually every year,
00:01:35 ‎thousands of miniature books
00:01:37 ‎were transported secretly  ‎to Eastern Europe.
00:01:40 ‎So it was not just a matter
00:01:43 ‎of us being so clever in hiding things
00:01:47 ‎and getting it to the brothers,
00:01:49 ‎but we were always fully convinced  ‎and had evidence
00:01:53 ‎that it was Jehovah’s holy spirit  ‎that helped us.
00:01:57 ‎Also, we transported stencils
00:02:00 ‎for local production ‎so that in their countries
00:02:04 ‎they could reproduce the same material
00:02:07 ‎with mimeographing machines.
00:02:09 ‎In most cases, ‎the mimeographing machines
00:02:13 ‎were transported secretly ‎by the couriers.
00:02:16 ‎The other method  ‎was to build it within the country.
00:02:21 ‎I remember that there was a brother
00:02:23 ‎who was a very skilled engineer,
00:02:25 ‎and under his direction, ‎they decided to build it themselves.
00:02:29 ‎So there were self-made  ‎offset printing presses.
00:02:34 ‎The brothers had a number  ‎of underground printeries
00:02:38 ‎that they had dug out  ‎under their own homes.
00:02:41 ‎In many cases, the brothers had to do  ‎what they did during the night
00:02:46 ‎because in Communist countries,
00:02:50 ‎they had to go during the day
00:02:52 ‎to a factory or whatever else  ‎and do some secular work.
00:02:56 ‎But it testifies to the great spirit
00:02:59 ‎of sacrifice that the brothers showed
00:03:01 ‎—to forfeit so much  ‎of their private life as a family
00:03:05 ‎to do at night the printing ‎of the spiritual food.
00:03:10 ‎Some had only a few hours of sleep,
00:03:15 ‎but they loved Jehovah  ‎and the brothers so much
00:03:19 ‎that they did it.
00:03:22 ‎There was no Kingdom Hall.
00:03:25 ‎The brothers  ‎had secret meetings in private homes,
00:03:29 ‎and they would not all come  ‎at the same time
00:03:32 ‎because if the neighbors  ‎would see certain persons
00:03:35 ‎all the time going to a specific house, ‎there could be suspicions.
00:03:41 ‎And every week, they had the meetings
00:03:44 ‎in a different home of the brothers.
00:03:46 ‎And this helped to protect the work
00:03:49 ‎so that it could be kept secret.
00:03:52 ‎Singing was very important ‎for the brothers,
00:03:56 ‎and they didn’t have to have  ‎a songbook in hand.
00:03:59 ‎They knew the text of the song by heart,
00:04:02 ‎and immediately after saying a number,
00:04:05 ‎they could sing the song.
00:04:07 ‎That affected the heart ‎—the emotions of the brothers—
00:04:11 ‎so they were strengthened  ‎in their determination to be faithful.
00:04:16 ‎A lot of pressure  ‎was on the brothers in Romania.
00:04:20 ‎The Communist Party tried
00:04:23 ‎to sow distrust among the brothers,
00:04:26 ‎meeting with them separately
00:04:28 ‎and telling some brothers one thing
00:04:30 ‎and telling other brothers something else.
00:04:34 ‎Sometimes it happened
00:04:36 ‎that an official posed  ‎as an interested person
00:04:38 ‎and was clever enough to disguise that
00:04:42 ‎and pretend  ‎to make progress in the truth
00:04:46 ‎—not only to the point  ‎of getting baptized
00:04:49 ‎but even to the point  ‎of becoming an elder.
00:04:53 ‎But he was in reality an agent  ‎of the secret police
00:04:58 ‎with an aim to find out everything  ‎about the organization.
00:05:02 ‎So it did lead to, in one case,
00:05:04 ‎the brothers starting to distrust someone
00:05:09 ‎that was actually appointed by headquarters.
00:05:12 ‎And these brothers then separated
00:05:15 ‎from the organization that Jehovah used,
00:05:19 ‎and some of them were separated
00:05:21 ‎for not just a few years but for decades.
00:05:24 ‎And they were a large number,
00:05:28 ‎up to 5,000 publishers.
00:05:30 ‎They continued to meet together.
00:05:33 ‎They were preaching and using material
00:05:36 ‎that they had left over from earlier years,
00:05:38 ‎but they hardly got  ‎any new material to study
00:05:42 ‎because they were not in touch ‎with the organization
00:05:44 ‎that was used by headquarters.
00:05:47 ‎Attempts to bring the brothers back  ‎into the organization
00:05:51 ‎were made from time to time,
00:05:55 ‎but it seemed that the brothers
00:05:57 ‎from the separated organization  ‎did not have sufficient trust.
00:06:02 ‎But when we presented
00:06:06 ‎to the leader of the separated group
00:06:09 ‎that one  ‎from the Governing Body would come,
00:06:13 ‎he was happy about that  ‎and he had enough trust in that case
00:06:18 ‎to agree that we should have a meeting
00:06:21 ‎and seriously talk about reunification.
00:06:26 ‎And so from the separated group,
00:06:28 ‎there were Brother Albu,  ‎who was the leader,
00:06:31 ‎and four of his main elders.
00:06:34 ‎And from our side,  ‎there was Brother Jaracz,
00:06:38 ‎our translator,  ‎and I was part of that group.
00:06:42 ‎Also, there were several
00:06:45 ‎from the Country Committee of Romania.
00:06:50 ‎I remember that the first night  ‎there were a lot of accusations
00:06:54 ‎about what the others  ‎had done or not done,
00:06:56 ‎which did not create the best spirit,
00:07:01 ‎and we mainly listened.
00:07:04 ‎But everybody agreed  ‎to meet another night.
00:07:08 ‎And the second night,  ‎Jehovah obviously wanted
00:07:10 ‎the brothers to unite again
00:07:13 ‎because the whole spirit was different,
00:07:16 ‎and the brothers talked the matters over
00:07:18 ‎and clarified some misunderstandings.
00:07:21 ‎And at the end of the second evening,
00:07:25 ‎I remember that the leader  ‎of the separated group,
00:07:26 ‎Brother Albu, said, ‎‘Let’s do it because if we don’t do it now,
00:07:31 ‎we may never have  ‎another opportunity again.’
00:07:36 ‎And so the decision was made.
00:07:42 ‎That doesn’t happen every day ‎that 5,000 brothers
00:07:45 ‎come back to the organization.
00:07:51 ‎From then on, all the practical things
00:07:54 ‎were put in place  ‎to accomplish this reunification.
00:07:58 ‎They were asked to merge  ‎with our congregations.
00:08:03 ‎And that also took a lot of humility
00:08:05 ‎on their part, ‎but they were willing to do it.
00:08:10 ‎So they were really brothers
00:08:14 ‎in their heart and loved the truth.
00:08:18 ‎And so the reunification was accomplished,
00:08:22 ‎and that was a wonderful victory  ‎for Jehovah and against Satan.
00:08:28 ‎Reflecting on the experience  ‎with the brothers in Romania,
00:08:32 ‎we can see that there could always be
00:08:35 ‎misunderstandings among humans
00:08:38 ‎and there could always be  ‎even legitimate complaints
00:08:43 ‎about the misconduct  ‎of some responsible brothers.
00:08:47 ‎But the important thing  ‎is never to lose trust
00:08:52 ‎that this is Jehovah’s organization.
00:08:54 ‎That’s where Jehovah’s blessing is.
00:08:57 ‎Jehovah sees it all.
00:08:59 ‎Jehovah uses his holy spirit  ‎to keep the organization together,
00:09:04 ‎and what he wants  ‎to have accomplished will happen.
00:09:08 ‎If we work with the holy spirit,
00:09:10 ‎then Jehovah will bless our efforts
00:09:13 ‎and it will be successful to his praise.

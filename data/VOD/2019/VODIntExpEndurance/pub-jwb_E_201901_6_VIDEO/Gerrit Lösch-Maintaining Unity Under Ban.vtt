‎I was serving at the Austria branch

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:10.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from about the mid-1970’s to 1990. 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had a small department

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that was assigned
‎to help certain countries in Eastern Europe. 

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And that included 
‎visiting the brothers under ban,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎bringing them spiritual food,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎having secret meetings with them,

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and also strengthening 
‎the local organization

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that was exposed 
‎to persecution and ban.

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We would print books on Bible paper

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in miniature size. 

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This way, more books or literature

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎could be taken to these countries.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:47.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The couriers transported literature

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to these countries 
‎in their own private cars. 

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This way, 
‎hundreds of books could be transported. 

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At the border, if a courier

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would be found transporting literature,

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they would interrogate the driver. 

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But these brothers were trained;

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:08.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they knew what to say
‎to protect the work

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and to not give away any secrets. 

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Usually, after a day or two days,

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the officials would let them go back home

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to their home country 
‎but not with their car;

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they had to use public transportation

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because their cars would be confiscated. 

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:31.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But the brothers had the spirit of sacrifice;
‎they were willing to risk that. 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But the majority got through,
‎and actually every year,

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎thousands of miniature books

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were transported secretly 
‎to Eastern Europe. 

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So it was not just a matter

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of us being so clever in hiding things

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and getting it to the brothers,

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but we were always fully convinced 
‎and had evidence

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that it was Jehovah’s holy spirit 
‎that helped us.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Also, we transported stencils

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for local production
‎so that in their countries

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they could reproduce the same material

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with mimeographing machines. 

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In most cases,
‎the mimeographing machines

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were transported secretly
‎by the couriers. 

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The other method 
‎was to build it within the country. 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I remember that there was a brother

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who was a very skilled engineer,

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:29.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and under his direction,
‎they decided to build it themselves. 

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So there were self-made 
‎offset printing presses.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The brothers had a number 
‎of underground printeries

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that they had dug out 
‎under their own homes. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In many cases, the brothers had to do 
‎what they did during the night

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because in Communist countries,

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they had to go during the day

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to a factory or whatever else 
‎and do some secular work. 

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:59.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But it testifies to the great spirit

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of sacrifice that the brothers showed

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—to forfeit so much 
‎of their private life as a family

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to do at night the printing
‎of the spiritual food. 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Some had only a few hours of sleep,

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but they loved Jehovah 
‎and the brothers so much

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that they did it.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎There was no Kingdom Hall. 

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The brothers 
‎had secret meetings in private homes,

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they would not all come 
‎at the same time

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:35.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because if the neighbors 
‎would see certain persons

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎all the time going to a specific house,
‎there could be suspicions. 

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And every week, they had the meetings

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in a different home of the brothers. 

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And this helped to protect the work

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:52.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so that it could be kept secret.

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Singing was very important
‎for the brothers,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they didn’t have to have 
‎a songbook in hand. 

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They knew the text of the song by heart,

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and immediately after saying a number,

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they could sing the song. 

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That affected the heart
‎—the emotions of the brothers—

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so they were strengthened 
‎in their determination to be faithful.

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎A lot of pressure 
‎was on the brothers in Romania. 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Communist Party tried

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:26.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to sow distrust among the brothers,

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎meeting with them separately

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and telling some brothers one thing

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and telling other brothers something else. 

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Sometimes it happened

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:38.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that an official posed 
‎as an interested person

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:42.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and was clever enough to disguise that

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and pretend 
‎to make progress in the truth

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:49.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—not only to the point 
‎of getting baptized

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:53.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but even to the point 
‎of becoming an elder. 

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:57.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But he was in reality an agent 
‎of the secret police

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with an aim to find out everything 
‎about the organization. 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So it did lead to, in one case,

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the brothers starting to distrust someone

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that was actually appointed by headquarters. 

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And these brothers then separated

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:19.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from the organization that Jehovah used,

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and some of them were separated

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for not just a few years but for decades. 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And they were a large number,

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:30.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎up to 5,000 publishers. 

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:33.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They continued to meet together. 

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:36.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They were preaching and using material

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:38.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that they had left over from earlier years,

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:42.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but they hardly got 
‎any new material to study

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because they were not in touch
‎with the organization

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that was used by headquarters.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Attempts to bring the brothers back 
‎into the organization

00:05:51.872 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were made from time to time,

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but it seemed that the brothers

00:05:57.586 --> 00:06:02.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from the separated organization 
‎did not have sufficient trust. 

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:06.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But when we presented

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the leader of the separated group

00:06:09.097 --> 00:06:13.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that one 
‎from the Governing Body would come,

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:18.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he was happy about that 
‎and he had enough trust in that case

00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:21.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to agree that we should have a meeting

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:25.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and seriously talk about reunification.

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:28.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And so from the separated group,

00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:31.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there were Brother Albu, 
‎who was the leader,

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:34.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and four of his main elders. 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And from our side, 
‎there was Brother Jaracz,

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:42.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎our translator, 
‎and I was part of that group. 

00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:45.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Also, there were several

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from the Country Committee of Romania. 

00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:54.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I remember that the first night 
‎there were a lot of accusations

00:06:54.643 --> 00:06:56.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about what the others 
‎had done or not done,

00:06:56.853 --> 00:07:01.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎which did not create the best spirit,

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:03.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we mainly listened. 

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But everybody agreed 
‎to meet another night. 

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And the second night, 
‎Jehovah obviously wanted

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:13.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the brothers to unite again

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because the whole spirit was different,

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the brothers talked the matters over

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and clarified some misunderstandings. 

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:25.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And at the end of the second evening,

00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:26.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I remember that the leader 
‎of the separated group,

00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:31.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Brother Albu, said,
‎‘Let’s do it because if we don’t do it now,

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we may never have 
‎another opportunity again.’ 

00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And so the decision was made.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That doesn’t happen every day
‎that 5,000 brothers 

00:07:45.694 --> 00:07:48.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎come back to the organization.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎From then on, all the practical things

00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:58.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were put in place 
‎to accomplish this reunification. 

00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:03.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They were asked to merge 
‎with our congregations.

‎And that also took a lot of humility

00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:10.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎on their part,
‎but they were willing to do it. 

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So they were really brothers

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:18.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in their heart and loved the truth. 

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And so the reunification was accomplished,

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:27.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and that was a wonderful victory 
‎for Jehovah and against Satan.

‎Reflecting on the experience 
‎with the brothers in Romania,

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we can see that there could always be

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎misunderstandings among humans

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and there could always be 
‎even legitimate complaints

00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:47.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about the misconduct 
‎of some responsible brothers. 

00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:52.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But the important thing 
‎is never to lose trust

00:08:52.052 --> 00:08:54.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that this is Jehovah’s organization. 

00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s where Jehovah’s blessing is. 

00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:59.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah sees it all. 

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:04.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah uses his holy spirit 
‎to keep the organization together,

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:08.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and what he wants 
‎to have accomplished will happen. 

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎If we work with the holy spirit,

00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:13.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎then Jehovah will bless our efforts

00:09:13.657 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and it will be successful to his praise.

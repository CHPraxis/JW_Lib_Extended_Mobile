00:00:02 Culture on my island is very strong.
00:00:06 For example, the head of the family can choose the family’s religion
00:00:10 and also who they will marry.
00:00:16 One day, many family members of a boy
00:00:19 that my father wanted me to marry
00:00:22 came to visit my father.
00:00:24 Their purpose was that they could request
00:00:27 that we would be married.
00:00:29 I respectfully explained that I could not do that.
00:00:32 So my father started beating me.
00:00:35 The first blow with the rod was very painful.
00:00:39 But Jehovah helped me by moving Mama to act
00:00:43 as if she would help him to beat me,
00:00:46 but instead, she didn’t actually beat me.
00:00:50 For six months, he imprisoned me in the house,
00:00:53 and he assigned me various hard jobs to do.
00:00:58 The thing that was the most difficult for me
00:01:01 was not being with the brothers and sisters
00:01:03 doing spiritual activities for Jehovah.
00:01:06 But what really strengthened me
00:01:09 was the gift of prayer.
00:01:12 I would pray constantly
00:01:14 and talk to Jehovah through prayer.
00:01:17 When I would do the meetings by myself,
00:01:20 I would make a schedule on Saturday night.
00:01:23 Then, on Sunday when all my family went to church,
00:01:27 I would start by praying,
00:01:31 singing, reading the paragraphs,
00:01:34 raising my hand,
00:01:36 and I would answer the questions myself.
00:01:40 It was as if I was with my brothers and sisters at the meeting.
00:01:45 Also, I would wait to see my younger cousins
00:01:48 every Sunday as they walked by
00:01:51 because I knew they would visit my studies and return visits.
00:01:55 I just went to the kitchen to wait.
00:01:59 I waited for them and watched them go by,
00:02:02 looking forward to being able to see them,
00:02:06 even though they didn’t see me.
00:02:08 Only I saw them.
00:02:11 And when they passed by,
00:02:13 I saw that they went to preach where the Bible students were.
00:02:17 I really felt strengthened, happy.
00:02:21 During those trials that I had to endure,
00:02:24 there were times that I was very scared, frightened.
00:02:28 I really needed the courage that Jehovah supplies.
00:02:33 That is why I begged Jehovah for courage,
00:02:36 and immediately Jehovah gave me courage
00:02:40 so that I didn’t have to be afraid anymore.
00:02:43 I had peace, and I was able to endure those trials.
00:02:47 By helping me to endure that test,
00:02:50 Jehovah helped me to experience the blessings that I’m having today.
00:02:55 Now, I am really happy!
00:03:06 In 2013, we decided to make a move
00:03:10 from the United States to the Marshall Islands.
00:03:13 We have a combined family
00:03:15 of 9 children and 24 grandchildren.
00:03:17 We had a middle income family,
00:03:21 and, you know, you have everything at your disposal.
00:03:24 It was a big adjustment
00:03:26 to move where we knew that we wouldn’t have those conveniences.
00:03:30 Life here is very different from the United States.
00:03:33 Many of the houses don’t have kitchens or indoor bathrooms,
00:03:38 and even in the house that we rented,
00:03:40 there was no stove or refrigerator.
00:03:42 I was very apprehensive about making the move.
00:03:45 It’s a little bit harder for older ones to learn a new language.
00:03:48 And so how would I be able to conduct Bible studies?
00:03:52 How would I be able to, as an elder, help out within the congregation?
00:03:58 I had one study who had a really fierce dog,
00:04:01 and I really didn’t want to go back to that house.
00:04:05 But I went back to have the Bible study,
00:04:08 and I didn’t see the dog.
00:04:10 So I asked her, “Where is the dog?”
00:04:11 And she said,
00:04:12 “My uncle ate him.”
00:04:15 At 2 Chronicles 15:7,
00:04:16 it says ‘do not be discouraged, there exists a reward for your activity.’
00:04:22 And so we busied and asserted ourselves in the work.
00:04:25 And so immediately we had, like, ten Bible studies in two weeks.
00:04:29 But the benefit of that is we would go over chapter one,
00:04:34 maybe ten times.
00:04:36 And so through repetition and through due diligence,
00:04:40 it really facilitated us
00:04:42 learning the language and being able to use it
00:04:45 to study with people and help them come to know Jehovah.
00:04:48 I am a bit afraid of water.
00:04:50 You know, we are on an island,
00:04:52 and here I’m surrounded by water, and I cannot swim.
00:04:56 We had a campaign recently to preach to the outer islands,
00:05:00 so I had to think about the people.
00:05:03 When I think about their desire to learn
00:05:07 more about God, their love for God,
00:05:09 their love and respect for the Bible,
00:05:12 it really motivates me to keep going in spite of my fears.
00:05:16 And when you think about going from door to door,
00:05:20 every person will stop —stop what they’re doing—
00:05:24 to talk to you about God.
00:05:26 They’ll accept the literature; they want Bible studies.
00:05:29 It’s really a pioneer’s dream.
00:05:31 Their desire,
00:05:33 their love for the truth and wanting to know about Jehovah,
00:05:37 well, that’s an additional blessing that is encouraging and strengthening us.
00:05:41 She says, “It’s a pioneer’s dream.”
00:05:43 I say, “It’s a pioneer’s paradise.”

After attending the School for Kingdom
Evangelizers, I received an assignment

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in another part of the country.

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is an area where it is costly to live,
and the living expenses are high.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was worried about how it would turn out

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if I could manage.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not too long thereafter,
I found a small room I could rent.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The housing conditions
were not ideal, but it was OK.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also received a small cleaning job,

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was not quite enough
for me to make ends meet.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to travel a long distance to get to work.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was tired constantly,

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it was difficult
to keep my focus on the ministry.

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had some savings when I moved,
but it started to shrink.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My funds slowly dwindled.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:59.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By coincidence, I saw a job advertisement.

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I handed in an application,

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one and a half hours later,
they called me in for an interview.

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They felt bad because they could only offer me
a part-time position.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To compensate, they offered me a higher salary,
which I didnâ€™t object to.

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time that I found a job,
a couple came to me in the Kingdom Hall

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that they had found
an apartment for me.

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a city where it is very difficult
to find a place to live,

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suddenly had a small and cozy apartment.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now everything has come together.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that I can focus on my ministry

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the congregation.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows just what we need.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we test him out,

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will bless our efforts.

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really feel safe leaving my life in his hands.

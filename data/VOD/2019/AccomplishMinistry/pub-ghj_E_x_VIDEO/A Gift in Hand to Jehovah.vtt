In ancient times,
when an Israelite

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:11.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a heartfelt offering 
to support the temple,

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that offering was referred to 
as ‘a gift in hand to Jehovah.’

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, in Kingdom Halls
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world, 
there are small boxes

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
marked for voluntary contributions.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we give our valuable things, 
where does it actually go?

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each year, hundreds of thousands 
become our new brothers and sisters.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accommodate our growing numbers,

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
funds are provided to help construct 
new places of worship,

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as branch facilities 
all over the world.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that I really appreciate 
about being here

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to see family heads, 
fathers and husbands,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
choose to use their vacation time.

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:03.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thank you to the families 
and the congregations

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that support all of this
and us to be here.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s just as impressive
is seeing millions of brothers and sisters

00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:14.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
voluntarily give of their funds 
so that we can keep building.

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:18.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just that in itself is an amazing act
of Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:23.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Large doors leading to greater activity

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being opened 
by means of theocratic schools.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Training is provided to help 
those enrolled to develop spiritually

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take a zealous lead 
in the evangelizing work.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think of the organization 
and the education,

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine education that it provides,

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is no government on earth today

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that educates its citizens 
like the Kingdom.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has strengthened 
my relationship with Jehovah

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways I never considered before.

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The training is wonderful; 
it motivates spiritual growth.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Voluntary contributions help support

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the thousands of special 
full-time servants worldwide.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These include Bethelites.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While working in the printery, 
it’s abundantly clear

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:15.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that none of this could happen 
without Jehovah’s support,

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shown by what the friends can give.

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my assignment, 
and serve with the knowledge

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:24.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my sacrifice wouldn’t be possible

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the sacrifice 
of brothers and sisters in the field.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also included are missionaries,

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveling overseers,

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:35.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
international servants, 
and special pioneers.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the support makes it possible

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes our assignment 
a great joy and a privilege,

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:46.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that we look forward to 
each and every week,

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:47.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each and every month,

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each and every year 
that we’re able to devote

00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:53.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our full-time efforts in preaching 
the good news of the Kingdom.

00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It allows us to be here so that we 
can help as many people as possible

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who do want to learn about Jehovah.

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:03.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every year, we look forward to receiving

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rich spiritual gems at our conventions.

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Funds are provided for equipment 
and other needs

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:13.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help everything run 
as smoothly as possible.

00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a delight this year to see

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:19.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how technology was used 
to promote the unity.

00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:21.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having the different cities involved

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where video streaming

by Governing Body members 
and their helpers

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:29.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received tremendous response 
from those cities.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen more people 
in their seats during the program

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were afraid 
to get up even for a moment

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:38.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause they might miss 
something that was special.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When disaster strikes,

00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:43.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

immediate relief

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:46.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers and sisters in need.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and much more are shipped over 
as quickly as possible.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have come to really appreciate 
Jehovah’s organization.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No other organization can compare

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:04.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in how it provides support 
in such a loving way.

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:07.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know now that Jehovah 
does look after his people.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m really grateful for that,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been praying and giving thanks.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

have a meaningful share

Kingdom interests worldwide.

Each donation is like ‘a gift in hand 
to our heavenly Father Jehovah.’

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we give from our heart,

we are expressing our love for him,

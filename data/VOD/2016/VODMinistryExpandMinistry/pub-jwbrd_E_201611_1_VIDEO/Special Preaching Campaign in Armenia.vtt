00:05.067 --> 00:08.487
Armenia is an ancient country 
with rich history, 


00:08.487 --> 00:11.000
situated in the lands 
of Mount Ararat.


00:13.783 --> 00:16.203
In the Caucasus region, 
Lake Sevan 


00:16.203 --> 00:19.000
is considered to be 
a prized jewel.


00:22.918 --> 00:25.253
Diversity of its flora and fauna 


00:25.253 --> 00:28.000
contribute to the unique 
and beautiful countryside.


00:30.717 --> 00:33.137
Yerevan, the capital, 


00:33.137 --> 00:36.390
is a modern metropolis 
with picturesque views 


00:36.390 --> 00:40.227
that remind many of Paris 
with its trees, cafés, 


00:40.227 --> 00:43.000
and beautiful water fountains.


00:47.568 --> 00:52.000
Recently, a special three-week 
preaching campaign took place.


00:53.740 --> 00:56.493
Groups of Armenian-speaking 
Jehovah’s Witnesses 


00:56.493 --> 00:58.078
from six different countries 


00:58.078 --> 01:02.000
wholeheartedly responded 
to the invitation.


01:07.295 --> 01:10.798
The main purpose of the campaign 
was to cover as many


01:10.798 --> 01:13.968
of the 512 unassigned territories
as possible 


01:13.968 --> 01:16.138
with the Kingdom good news. 


01:16.138 --> 01:18.140
Thus, an opportunity 


01:18.140 --> 01:21.518
for an interchange 
of encouragement was created 


01:21.518 --> 01:25.000
for both the local friends 
and the campaign participants.


01:27.148 --> 01:29.651
They were warmly greeted 
at the airport 


01:29.652 --> 01:32.000
by local brothers and sisters.


01:37.910 --> 01:41.705
The Witnesses made good use 
of their tablets and smartphones to show


01:41.705 --> 01:45.542
videos from the jw.org website.


01:45.542 --> 01:48.379
Armenia is also currently home 


01:48.378 --> 01:52.381
to over 11,000 Western-Armenian refugees.


01:52.382 --> 01:55.635
A special effort was made 
to share with these individuals 


01:55.635 --> 01:58.763
the positive message of hope
and peace from the Bible


01:58.763 --> 02:01.000
in their native tongue, 
West Armenian.


02:02.100 --> 02:05.478
Metropolitan witnessing 
served as an effective way 


02:05.478 --> 02:07.856
to reach these ones.


02:07.857 --> 02:10.109
It was the first time in my life 


02:10.108 --> 02:12.485
that I participated in public witnessing, 


02:12.485 --> 02:14.488
and it was very encouraging. 


02:14.488 --> 02:17.240
When individuals would approach us 
and show interest, 


02:17.240 --> 02:19.952
I could explain to them 
the truth in their own language. 


02:19.952 --> 02:21.954
It was amazing.


02:21.953 --> 02:24.121
It’s been very heartwarming. 


02:24.122 --> 02:26.792
People have really responded well. 


02:26.792 --> 02:28.419
They were in need of comfort


02:28.418 --> 02:30.003
and the good news, especially those that 


02:30.003 --> 02:32.296
we came for,
the Western Armenians. 


02:32.297 --> 02:34.967
Pretty much every door invited us in, 


02:34.967 --> 02:37.219
and they were very hospitable 
and receptive.


02:37.218 --> 02:40.138
After we heard the announcement 
about the special campaign 


02:40.138 --> 02:43.475
in the Western language 
that’s going to take place in Armenia, 


02:43.475 --> 02:45.477
we said: “We cannot miss this. 


02:45.477 --> 02:47.479
“We have to be there 
and bring our share 


02:47.478 --> 02:50.815
in this very joyful
preaching campaign.”


02:50.815 --> 02:53.110
During the three-week campaign, 


02:53.110 --> 02:55.195
over 15,000 pieces 


02:55.195 --> 02:58.490
of Bible-based literature 
were left with interested ones, 


02:58.490 --> 03:01.000
and over 200 Bible studies 
were started.


03:03.828 --> 03:06.248
We were very happy to see 


03:06.248 --> 03:09.166
how many brothers and sisters 
were ready to come 


03:09.167 --> 03:11.170
for the campaign in Armenia 


03:11.170 --> 03:13.797
from different countries 
around the world.


03:13.797 --> 03:15.799
That response showed 


03:15.798 --> 03:18.000
that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.


03:19.177 --> 03:21.347
Those who came from far and wide 


03:21.347 --> 03:23.432
greatly appreciated the share 


03:23.432 --> 03:25.684
they had in this special event.


03:25.683 --> 03:28.270
Everyone was so happy to see us. 


03:28.270 --> 03:30.355
And when we were giving them a Bible, 


03:30.355 --> 03:34.275
they were so excited to find answers
from their own Bible.


03:34.275 --> 03:36.528
I’m so blessed to be here. 


03:36.528 --> 03:38.530
This has been the best vacation 


03:38.530 --> 03:41.117
that we have had as a family.


03:41.117 --> 03:43.785
The first time I came to Armenia, 


03:43.785 --> 03:45.953
it was in 1982. 


03:45.953 --> 03:48.123
And I looked for the Witnesses, 


03:48.123 --> 03:51.293
and I hardly found just a few. 


03:51.293 --> 03:54.630
But now that I came 
for this campaign, 


03:54.630 --> 03:57.715
we have 11,000 Witnesses! 


03:57.715 --> 04:01.000
I’m really so happy! 
I really want to come back!


04:02.847 --> 04:06.517
It is our hope that Jehovah God 
continues to help 


04:06.517 --> 04:09.019
all sorts of people to be saved 


04:09.018 --> 04:29.728
and come 
to an accurate knowledge of truth.

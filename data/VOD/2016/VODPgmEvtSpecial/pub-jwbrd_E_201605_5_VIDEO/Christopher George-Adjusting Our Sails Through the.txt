00:00 There’s a common saying  at Bethel
00:03 that the only thing  that is constant is change.
00:06 But frankly, that’s an understatement now,  wouldn’t you say?
00:11 In fact, wherever you turn,  it seems like at every occasion
00:16 we see change coming about  in one way or another.
00:19 In fact, when I first  submitted this outline
00:23 and think back to that day,
00:26 it has changed so much  just in those few months.
00:29 It really shows that we are  in a time of great change.
00:34 Of course, we’re in an organization  that’s built on change.
00:39 We’re in an organization  that as far back as Brother Russell
00:43 was willing  to study God’s Word and see
00:46 where perhaps his belief did not align  with what God’s Word said, and he changed.
00:51 And from that day forward,  our organization has continued to change.
00:56 And aren’t we glad  “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:58 continues to make adjustments  where necessary
01:02 for the sake of the preaching work;  for the sake of Jehovah’s name;
01:06 and, of course,  for his people, his sheep.
01:09 So when we think about that,
01:12 we think,  ‘Change is not always bad.’
01:15 Now, all change  is not profound either.
01:19 We’ve had many changes  right here in Bethel in the last few years
01:22 —changes  that have benefited us as well.
01:25 Perhaps maybe it’s having  all our Saturdays off
01:28 so we can enjoy field service  with the congregation more regularly.
01:32 Perhaps it’s an extra day off  when we turn 70.
01:37 So, again, personal matters  can be attended to;
01:40 field service can be enjoyed  more fully by these.
01:43 What a blessing!
01:44 Even to have morning worship
01:46 and our Watchtower Study  in our room when we’re sick.
01:48 These are nice changes.
01:49 We can just go on and on  about the things that we enjoy in changes.
01:54 But sometimes,  sometimes in our life,
01:58 changes come about that maybe,
02:01 well, they cut a little deeper  into our comfort zone.
02:04 Isn’t that true?
02:06 So maybe it can cause us  a measure of personal anxiety
02:09 —maybe it’s fear of the unknown.
02:11 Or maybe it’s just the feeling  that I don’t have as much control
02:15 in my life anymore because  of this change that’s come about.
02:19 And so there is some anxiety  that goes with that.
02:22 In fact, whatever the case,
02:25 if we allow ourselves  to become too anxious,
02:28 the truth of Proverbs 12:25  comes about, where it says:
02:31 “Anxiety in a man’s heart  weighs it down.”
02:35 And so it can actually prevent us  from moving forward.
02:38 It can prevent us or it can slow us down  sometimes and we become overwhelmed
02:42 with anxious feelings  about what’s going on around me.
02:46 How am I being affected?
02:50 We use the example  in the theme
02:53 to talk about those sailors  on a sailing ship.
02:58 Why?
02:59 Well, because for a sailor  while at sea,
03:02 it may seem that he  is at the mercy of the elements.
03:06 And it’s true,  he cannot control the weather,
03:09 but he can adjust  to the weather.
03:14 An experienced sailor  is able to keep control.
03:17 He’s able  to stay on course
03:20 —by adjusting his sails,  by continuing to move forward,
03:24 by catching the wind from different angles,  and by allowing himself
03:28 to keep making progress
03:31 —even though at first  bad weather can slow you down.
03:35 In fact, for a ship to keep moving,  it has to have the winds
03:38 catching the sails.
03:40 And if you’ve ever seen a racing team  that has raced these large sailing ships,
03:45 it’s amazing how they can maneuver them,  how they can turn them,
03:48 how fast they can go  because they are experienced.
03:52 Well, in some ways, we think
03:56 we may not have complete control  over our life at Bethel.
03:59 And that’s true, we don’t.
04:01 We do have changing circumstances,
04:05 but we also  can keep control of our life.
04:09 Why?  Why can we say that?
04:11 Well, turn with me  to our first scripture in the 46th Psalm.
04:16 In Psalm 46,
04:18 notice what it says  in the very first three verses.
04:22 It says:  ‘God is our refuge and strength,
04:27 ‘a help that is readily found  in times of distress.
04:31 ‘That is why we will not fear,  though the earth undergoes change,
04:35 ‘though the mountains topple  into the depths of the sea,
04:38 ‘though the waters  roar and foam over,
04:40 though the mountains rock  on account of its turbulence.’
04:44 Of course, these  are some pretty extreme circumstances.
04:48 I’m in no way  saying that’s Bethel.
04:50 But if we think  about the amount of change:
04:55 The entire earth is portrayed here  as undergoing some massive changes
05:00 —mountains falling into the sea,  violent oceans—and yet the psalmist said
05:04 he didn’t have to worry.
05:06 He was in control; he had no fear.  Why?
05:08 Because of verse 1:  ‘God is our refuge and strength,
05:12 ‘a help readily found  in times of distress.
05:15 That is why I will not fear.’
05:19 And the psalmist  did not fear because of that.
05:21 Jehovah is our strength;
05:24 he is our refuge.
05:26 And his stability
05:28 —the fact that he can never be shaken  in his stability—it grounds us.
05:33 It means that as long  as we stick close to Jehovah,
05:37 then nothing is going to put us  completely off balance.
05:41 And if it does  for a short period of time,
05:43 if we experience  a little bit of rough seas
05:45 —well, we adjust.
05:47 Why?
05:48 Because we have Jehovah,  and he helps us do that.
05:52 In our discussion tonight, we’re going  to consider three significant changes
05:57 —some have already happened,
05:59 some are affecting  our family even now,
06:03 and others will likely affect us  more even into the future.
06:07 We are also going to give attention  to three Bible accounts
06:10 that will help us to see Jehovah’s unchanging love
06:15 for us and his ability  to help us ride through any storm.
06:20 The first has to do  with a change of location.
06:25 Now, of course,  think back to January 6, 2015.
06:29 It seems like a long time ago.
06:30 It is.  In Bethel time, it seems.
06:32 It was a normal day at Bethel.
06:34 You made your way down  to the dining room
06:36 for some cheese and chive egg white omelet  and a little muesli.
06:42 Then came that historic Bethel announcement  from the Governing Body.
06:47 It adjusted what departments  would be transferring to Wallkill.
06:50 You remember.
06:51 Now, not the Computer Department,  not Regional Design Construction
06:55 but now the Service Department  and the Branch Committee Office
06:58 would be relocating to Wallkill.
07:01 So think about that.
07:03 How many people’s lives changed
07:06 with just a few sentences  in a few minutes at morning worship?
07:10 Of course,  the Regional Design Construction Department
07:13 would then be moving  to Puerto Rico.
07:15 Who would have thought of that?
07:17 Did you see that one coming?
07:20 Change can happen quickly.
07:22 But, of course,  as a result of that announcement,
07:24 just beginning next month,  some 400 members of our family
07:28 from Patterson and Brooklyn  will be moving to Wallkill
07:31 in the beginning  of large changes for all of us.
07:35 And as big as that was,  it does seem like a long time ago.
07:39 Just when you were coming to grips with that,  then September rolled around
07:44 and you came down  to breakfast.
07:47 Yes, they served muesli again.
07:54 But the announcement given  to the Bethel family that day
07:57 discussed additional changes  to the organization.
08:00 It included a significant reduction  to Bethel families around the world
08:05 and a reemphasis  to the preaching work
08:10 and the assistance that could be given  to that preaching work through this change.
08:15 For the United States Bethel family,  we learned that we would not retain
08:20 the tunnel complex  as had been previously planned.
08:23 Instead, all property in Brooklyn  would be sold and any remaining departments
08:27 would have to fit  within the properties upstate.
08:30 So more movement.
08:32 And that’s already,  according to our recent update,
08:35 already beginning.
08:37 And we are seeing  signs of that around, aren’t we?
08:40 So, of course,  for many of us, what that meant
08:43 was family worship  took a little detour that week.
08:47 We had to go home  and talk about some of these things
08:50 because our families  got affected by these changes.
08:54 Of course,  individually and as a family,
08:58 we do loyally comply  with any direction.
09:01 The organization has reasons
09:03 for making adjustments,  and we understand that.
09:05 And so we want to be cooperative.
09:09 But for many,  it does mean a big change.
09:11 Maybe leaving a complex that has been  the one they’ve served at forever
09:15 —since they’ve been at Bethel.
09:17 Maybe it’s where  they’ve become very close
09:20 to not just friends there  but in the congregation
09:23 that they’ve served in  for many, many years.
09:26 Or consider others perhaps  who have relocated their aging parents
09:31 into the area of the complex  they’ve been serving in.
09:34 Now, can they move them again?
09:37 Are their parents  well enough to even be moved?
09:39 These are real situations.
09:41 And we understand that, of course,  they could give us a measure of anxiety
09:46 that can make us seem  a little bit concerned
09:49 or maybe even overwhelmed  sometimes.
09:52 But how can we be helped?
09:54 What can we do  so that we can move on?
09:57 What are some ways?
09:59 Obviously,  we can’t change a decision.
10:02 That’s not our position,  and we don’t want to.
10:04 We want to be cooperative  with what’s being done.
10:08 So we’re looking  for ways to do that.
10:10 Well, look at what the psalmist said,  David’s words in the 40th Psalm.
10:17 In the 40th Psalm,  notice what David said
10:21 —the confidence he has  in verse 5.
10:24 It says: “How many things  you have done, O Jehovah my God,
10:29 “your wonderful works  and your thoughts toward us.
10:32 “None can compare to you;
10:34 “if I were to try to tell  and speak of them,
10:38 they would be  too numerous to recount!”
10:42 So maybe it’s time  to personally take stock
10:47 —personally recount the saving acts  that Jehovah has done
10:52 toward us personally
10:54 here at Bethel,  in our family.
10:58 Perhaps, did he take you by the hand  when you were nervous
11:02 about coming into Bethel  for the first day?
11:06 Maybe he helped care for you  when you were a new bride trying to adjust
11:11 to a new city,  a new congregation, marriage
11:16 and, of course, a new job —a new work you would do at Bethel.
11:20 Can you recall when you were feeling low  and he sent not just the right person
11:24 but the right person  at the right time with just the right words
11:27 to help kick you back into play a little bit  and maybe even protect you
11:32 from making a mistake about leaving  your Bethel service some time ago?
11:36 All of us probably can recount  over and over again
11:39 things that Jehovah has done  to show his love toward us
11:43 and his care for us,  even as David was confident.
11:47 But the question is,  Do you think He can do it again?
11:51 We had a beautiful Watchtower  just now that talked about faith.
11:55 And so we think about that.
11:57 Do we have that faith  that He will do it again?
11:59 Isaiah 59:1 says:  ‘Jehovah’s hand will not be short.’
12:03 There is nothing  that cannot be accomplished
12:06 for those  who are faithful to Jehovah.
12:09 So we can recount it.
12:12 It may be that we need  to even write it down.
12:14 It may need to be that we pray  about these things so that we say,
12:17 “Yes, I see how Jehovah  has really taken care of me.”
12:20 Now, for others . . .
12:22 Another group that’s affected  by that same announcement is . . .
12:27 Maybe they’re having  a little anxiety
12:29 over not moving  to another complex.
12:33 Maybe they had their hope set  on where they were going,
12:36 and they  were looking forward to it.
12:38 Of course, as all were, necessarily,  because they adjust themselves.
12:42 They think, ‘OK, I’m ready.  Well, now I’m not going.’
12:47 And it may be that the tendency would be  to say, “Well, why not me?
12:51 “Let’s see,  my department is going,
12:54 “my work is going,  my friends are going.
12:57 What?  Did I do something wrong?”
13:00 And yet, really,  that’s not the case.
13:03 But circumstances  and decisions have to be made,
13:07 and so now we find ourselves . . . We have to examine ourselves:
13:11 ‘How am I going to react  to those types of feelings
13:14 that come up within myself?’
13:17 Proverbs 13:12 says:
13:21 “Expectation postponed  makes the heart sick.”
13:24 But the footnote  to that scripture says,
13:27 where it says “expectation,”  it says “hope.”
13:30 And so it could be that our hopes,  or our expectations,
13:35 are not realized,  and it can take a toll on us.
13:37 That’s natural.
13:38 But the question is,  Will we allow it
13:42 —our emotions —to override our clear thinking?
13:44 Will we allow it to blow us off course,  so to speak, or slow us down
13:48 or even maybe change our direction  for a while, that,
13:52 well, we just don’t seem to be heading  in the same direction we thought we were?
13:56 We’re not making  as much progress as we once were.
13:59 To stay positive,  to stay levelheaded, to stay on course
14:04 requires sometimes that we  give a little change to our thinking
14:09 —especially if the circumstances  aren’t going to change.
14:13 It is easy to compare ourselves  with others, but it’s not healthy.
14:18 And Galatians 6:4  tells us not to compare.
14:21 It says don’t compare  ourselves or our work
14:23 with our fellow workers  in the truth or in the congregation.
14:28 So, what can be done?
14:30 Well, we would like to look  at our first Scriptural account.
14:33 It really helps us to see  the need to avoid comparing.
14:37 It has to do with Jesus’ selection  of the 12 apostles.
14:42 Think of what it meant to be with Jesus  at that time when he was on earth
14:46 —getting to know him,  working, learning from him personally,
14:51 listening to him  maybe day after day for some.
14:53 What a privilege!
14:55 They got to do it  for three and a half years.
14:58 We would trade a lot of time  even to spend just a little bit of time
15:03 learning from Jesus directly  like that, wouldn’t we?
15:07 Well, undoubtedly there were many  who wanted the privilege
15:11 of being one of Jesus’  closest disciples and apostles.
15:14 But the time came  that only 12 were chosen.
15:18 We know there were many  to choose from.
15:20 Look at what it says  in Acts the first chapter.
15:25 In Acts 1,
15:27 notice when they  were going to replace Judas,
15:31 who they chose from.
15:34 So after Jesus had died  and ascended to heaven,
15:37 verse 21, it says this  in Acts the first chapter.
15:40 Or after Jesus had died, it says this:  “It is therefore necessary
15:45 that of the men  who accompanied us,” in verse 21,
15:49 “during all the time in which the Lord Jesus  carried on his activities among us,
15:54 “starting with his baptism by John  until the day he was taken up from us,
15:59 one of these men should become a witness  with us of his resurrection.”
16:05 So there were many followers.
16:08 They knew who they were,  and they were able to select from them.
16:13 So imagine what it was
16:16 —a year and a half  into Jesus’ ministry,
16:18 after his baptism —it was time to select the Twelve.
16:23 This is what Mark 13  says in that account.
16:25 Mark the 3rd chapter, sorry.
16:27 In Mark chapter 3,  notice what it says
16:34 in verse 13.
16:36 It says of Jesus:  “He ascended a mountain
16:38 “and summoned those whom he wanted,  and they came to him.
16:42 “And he formed a group of 12,  whom he also named apostles,
16:46 “those who were to accompany him  and whom he would send out to preach
16:51 and to have authority  to expel demons.”
16:54 So Jesus selected from those.
16:58 Luke’s account says  he prayed all night about it first.
17:02 And then he came down,  and then from the crowd of his disciples,
17:06 he selected those 12 men.
17:09 Now, picture yourself there.
17:12 What if you were one of the men  who loyally stuck by Jesus since His baptism?
17:17 Maybe, like Andrew  and John and Peter and James,
17:21 you were  an instantaneous believer too.
17:23 You left everything,  and you followed Him immediately.
17:26 You believed,  and you left all things behind.
17:30 But Jesus didn’t select you  as one of his 12.
17:34 How would you feel?  Slighted? Wronged?
17:37 Maybe that some injustice  had been done?
17:40 Would you begin to discount  those who were selected?
17:42 No, of course not!
17:43 You would think:  ‘OK, I’m not going to be one of those 12.
17:47 But what are the blessings  I do get to enjoy?’
17:51 What were the blessings these men  would still be able to enjoy?
17:55 And apparently from Acts,  those men remained with Jesus.
17:59 Those followers—those disciples —stuck close to him as well.
18:03 Well, they still got to listen  to him teach and preach.
18:08 They still—just a few days later, really —would be able to hear
18:13 that famous Sermon on the Mount  if they had stayed right with him.
18:17 They were still entrusted  with the privilege of the ministry.
18:20 In fact, Jesus sent  the disciples out, the Twelve,
18:24 and then later  sent 70 to preach.
18:27 So, many others enjoyed  that blessing as well.
18:30 They could help others  to find the Messiah,
18:32 and they still had the hope  for the same reward
18:37 that those 12 apostles  were going to have
18:40 —being anointed and being able  to be in heaven with Jesus
18:44 after their resurrection.
18:46 So, what’s the lesson?
18:48 Well, rather than feeling  passed over for something
18:50 —maybe for the type of assignment or even the location of an assignment
18:53 —we think about it, we adjust.
18:56 ‘What do I have?  What are things I can enjoy?’
19:00 We devote ourselves, our time,  our energy, and all our mental resources
19:05 to fulfilling our ministry —what we’ve been given to do
19:08 whether it’s our work here at Bethel  or in the field, things we can control.
19:13 Because what’s the option —lower our sails,
19:18 just start floating aimlessly?
19:20 None of us want to do that.
19:22 That’s not why we came  to Bethel in the first place.
19:25 It also would be  a very dangerous thing to do.
19:29 So we avoid that.
19:32 Instead, we stay focused  on what’s most important.
19:36 Turn with me  to the book of 2 Corinthians,
19:42 2 Corinthians and the 4th chapter.
19:46 Notice what it says after talking  about the tribulation in verse 17
19:51 that’s “momentary and light”  and going to pass.
19:54 Notice what it says though  in verse 18:
19:56 “While we keep our eyes,  not on the things seen,
19:59 “but on the things unseen.
20:01 For the things seen are temporary,  but the things unseen are everlasting.”
20:06 What’s the lesson for us?
20:09 Everything in this system
20:13 except our relationship  with Jehovah is temporary
20:17 —our work assignments,  likely temporary;
20:21 our work locations,  temporary;
20:25 locations we live,  probably temporary too.
20:29 What doesn’t change  is our loyalty,
20:34 our devotion,  and integrity to Jehovah.
20:37 That’s what lasts,  and that’s why Jehovah promises
20:41 in Psalm 84:11:  ‘He will not hold back anything good
20:45 from those walking in integrity.’
20:49 You notice, it didn’t require  a location or a job assignment.
20:53 Psalm 18:25 says:  “With someone loyal
20:56 you [or Jehovah] act in loyalty.”
21:00 That’s Jehovah’s promise  to all of us.
21:03 There’s another group affected  by those couple of announcements,
21:08 and that’s our wives.
21:10 Now, our wives  are often impacted in greater ways
21:13 than even we are  by some of these changes.
21:16 Most of our dear wives,  pretty much they’re going to move
21:19 if their husband is moving.
21:21 Now, stop and think about that.
21:24 How could it make you feel?
21:26 What if their move  to another complex
21:28 means losing  the job that they love?
21:32 Maybe they  are even good at it, right?
21:35 You know what that’s like.
21:37 Or even leaving those  that they are enjoying working with,
21:40 but now they’re separating.
21:42 I know for our office,  our Bethel Office in Brooklyn,
21:46 we are splitting  into many different directions and going.
21:49 So we are feeling  very personally that movement
21:52 of members  of our very close family
21:56 of office mates  that will be moving too.
21:59 But for our wives,  they don’t even . . .
22:03 Some of them do not yet know  where they will work.
22:05 They’re waiting still on that.
22:07 So imagine how  that would make them feel.
22:10 And they might even wonder:  ‘Does anybody outside of my husband
22:13 even understand the anxiety  I am going through?’
22:16 Are emotions involved?  Absolutely!
22:18 Because often,  isn’t it true that we have more detail
22:22 about what’s going to happen to us  than sometimes even our wives do?
22:26 So it is good  for us to think about that.
22:28 What can help our wives  to cope with these feelings
22:31 and sometimes  the staying balanced and staying on course
22:36 with this question  hanging over their heads?
22:38 Well, we would like to consider  our second Scriptural example,
22:41 that of Esther.
22:43 Of the women in the Bible, Esther was one  who seemed to have very little say
22:47 on how she  would spend her life.
22:51 But she willingly submitted.
22:53 Let’s turn to Esther  and look at this account together.
22:58 In Esther the 2nd chapter,  we want to learn a little something
23:00 about Esther first —Esther the 2nd chapter,
23:04 verse 7, in the b part.
23:07 In the second part, it says:  “The young woman was beautifully formed
23:12 “and attractive in appearance,  and at the death
23:15 of her father and her mother, Mordecai took her as his daughter.”
23:19 So she was  a beautiful young woman
23:24 in Israel.
23:26 So no doubt,  there was no shortage
23:29 of nice young men
23:31 in the nation  that would have been interested,
23:33 and she probably  could have had her pick.
23:35 But did she get her pick?
23:37 No.
23:39 She, along with other  beautiful young women in that nation,
23:44 were taken by a pagan king,  Ahasuerus.
23:48 And look what it says  in chapter 2, verse 12.
23:53 It says, first it says:  “Each young woman had her turn
23:57 “to go in to King Ahasuerus  after completing the 12-month treatment
24:01 “that was prescribed for the women,  for this was the way
24:05 “they had to fulfill their beauty treatment —six months with oil of myrrh
24:09 and six months with balsam oil  and various ointments for beauty treatment.”
24:14 Verse 14, it says:  “In the evening she would go in,
24:18 and in the morning she would return  to the second house of the women.”
24:22 So, of course,  instead of her getting to pick
24:27 a nice young man  that she could raise a family with
24:31 and serve Jehovah with  and maybe even be
24:34 someone who could  produce the Messiah,
24:38 that was gone
24:40 because now she was with someone  who didn’t love Jehovah.
24:45 A pagan, really,  and he already had many wives.
24:49 So that’s a pretty difficult situation.
24:53 Could you go along with that?
24:55 Well, Esther did.  Why?
24:57 Well, this is what it says.
24:59 Even Mordecai told her,  ‘Don’t tell them you’re a Jew.’
25:02 Now, that may have gotten her  out of that whole arrangement.
25:05 Of course,  it may have cost her her life too.
25:07 But Esther 2:20 says this:
25:11 “Esther did not say anything  about her relatives and her people,
25:15 “just as Mordecai  had instructed. . . .
25:17 “Esther continued to do  what Mordecai said,
25:20 just as when she  was under his care.”
25:23 Esther put her personal preferences  and comforts aside.
25:27 She did just as she was told.
25:29 And, of course, we know what happened:  her act of faith, she became queen.
25:34 But also, what really happened?
25:37 Well, the 4th chapter, verse 14,
25:40 Mordecai says to her  in the latter part:
25:43 “Who knows whether  it is for a time like this
25:46 that you have attained  to your royal status?”
25:49 Jehovah used her.
25:51 She made herself available.
25:53 Her willingly complying —even in difficult circumstances
25:56 that would have tested  any Christian sister in our time
26:01 —surely shows  that she had
26:04 a beautiful,  a beautiful spirit.
26:07 And do you think she ever looked back  and regretted that decision
26:10 —whether or not her cozy little life  that she wished she would have had was lost?
26:15 If she did, if so, all she had to do  was look around and see
26:20 every little boy and little girl
26:22 that she saw pass by  and realize that she had something.
26:25 Her self-sacrifice helped Jehovah
26:28 in preserving  that young person alive.
26:32 So she was  a powerful woman of faith
26:35 that we can call  a good example.
26:38 And our sisters are no different.
26:39 You aren’t simply here at Bethel  because of your husbands.
26:43 You made a choice,  a conscious decision to come to Bethel
26:47 —to live a life of self-sacrifice  and devotion through your Bethel service.
26:52 And we know that.
26:54 You could have said no  when that young man was interested in you
26:57 and he asked you, “Would you like  to get married and come to Bethel?”
27:00 You could have said no.  He would’ve followed you anywhere, right?
27:05 Or you sisters who are already married,  and you sat down with your husband
27:10 and you prayed about it  and you talked about it:
27:12 “Can we make ourselves available  for this avenue of service?”
27:15 And if you would’ve said no,  he would’ve stuck with you.
27:18 But you didn’t.
27:20 You put your own  personal comforts aside to a measure
27:25 so that you could have  this additional avenue of service.
27:29 And you know, we often talk about  telling people what we did in the new system
27:33 when we’re in Paradise and others ask,  “How did you spend your time?”
27:37 You’re not going to say, “Well, my husband  was at Bethel, so I was there.”
27:42 You’re going to say: “No,  I was at Bethel with my husband.
27:47 “And we got to  serve Jehovah full-time
27:49 “in the most exciting time  of the organization’s history,
27:53 “and we got to see beautiful things  that strengthened our faith.
27:56 And we got to be a part of that —a part of that history.”
28:00 So it is for us.
28:03 We feel honored  to serve with you sisters
28:06 that are with us, our wives.
28:08 When Proverbs 31:31 speaks,  we think of you.
28:12 It says: “Give her  the reward for what she does,
28:15 and let her [own] works  praise her in the city gates.”
28:20 Now, that’s just one area of change.
28:22 What about a second area of change  that’s affecting many of us.
28:25 We want to talk about that  for just a few minutes.
28:28 And that’s the  change of assignment.
28:30 We’ve been talking  about reassignments.
28:33 But more specifically,  we’d like to talk to you brothers and sisters
28:36 who have been working  as temporary workers.
28:39 Some of you are temporary volunteers  who have poured your heart and soul
28:44 into the Wallkill and Warwick projects,  and we’re thankful for that.
28:49 You, many of you,  have seen the project go from a pile of dirt,
28:54 to a deep hole,  to beautiful structures.
28:56 At both locations, it’s been really marvelous  to see the willing workers.
29:01 But now the projects  are wrapping up,
29:05 and the majority of Wallkill work  will be done in just a few months.
29:09 And Warwick, of course, now we got the news:  move-in date of September 1.
29:14 So that’s exciting.
29:16 Some may have thought,  ‘Well, if I’d just worked hard enough,
29:19 if I’d just stayed long enough,  maybe I’d get to stay afterward.’
29:24 And we can’t blame you  for feeling that way.
29:26 But, of course, it’s pretty clear now,  many will be going home.
29:31 So, of course,  that’s a change of assignment for you.
29:34 You may be wondering  what you will do next.
29:37 Most, like you, are wondering, though,  where are you going to get the same joy?
29:41 Where are you going to be able  to do the same fulfilling work
29:44 that you made yourself  available for here?
29:46 And that’s really commendable.
29:48 We’d like you to consider  the account of Bezalel.
29:52 Now, we’ve talked  a lot about Bezalel.
29:54 Of course, during construction  we always do, right?
29:56 If you turn to the account  in Exodus 31,
30:00 let’s just look at this  together for just a moment.
30:04 In speaking about Bezalel,  this is what it says about him.
30:07 In verse 2  of chapter 31 of Exodus,
30:10 it says:  “See, I have chosen Bezalel
30:14 “the son of Uri the son of Hur  of the tribe of Judah.
30:17 “I will fill him with the spirit of God,  giving him wisdom,
30:21 understanding, and knowledge  of every kind of craftsmanship.”
30:26 And verse 6 says: ‘Moreover, to assist him  I have appointed Oholiab
30:30 ‘the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan,  and I am putting wisdom into his heart
30:35 ‘and all those who are skillful,
30:37 so that they may make everything  I have commanded you.’
30:40 Well, that was a powerful,  powerful commission
30:44 by Jehovah for Bezalel.
30:47 He personally would be overseeing  the building of the tabernacle,
30:51 but not just the tabernacle  but everything that was in it
30:55 —the furnishings,  the utensils, the ark of the covenant,
30:59 the cover of the ark,  the tables,
31:02 the alters,  even the clothing for the priests.
31:07 It’s really amazing
31:09 what he as well as these other  skilled craftsman had been able to do!
31:13 But in a sense,  isn’t that what Jehovah’s spirit
31:16 has empowered you to do  in your work at Wallkill and Warwick?
31:21 You came with skills,  and you learned others.
31:24 Like Bezalel, Jehovah’s spirit has helped,  and it’s been evident.
31:29 And no doubt Bezalel  was admired and praised for what he did,
31:33 just as we admire and praise  you for much of your work.
31:36 However,  once that tabernacle was inaugurated,
31:39 things changed for Bezalel.
31:42 When the tabernacle was inaugurated,  Bezalel could no longer enter it.
31:47 Leviticus 16  says that only Aaron
31:51 could come into the Most Holy  and only that during the appointed time.
31:55 Additionally, in Numbers 3:31,  it says Bezalel could no longer
31:59 even touch the furnishings  because now the Kohathites
32:03 had the sole responsibility  of moving those utensils.
32:07 So now here is someone who had  a personal hand in doing all of that work
32:12 for that tabernacle to be built,  but now he couldn’t go inside,
32:16 couldn’t touch,  couldn’t even look.
32:20 How do you think he felt?
32:22 Well, the scripture doesn’t say,
32:25 but likely  to a man of devotion like him,
32:29 the work would’ve been more important  than just his own personal feelings.
32:33 But we know this:  What he couldn’t do
32:37 would only be overshadowed  by what he could do.
32:41 He had beautiful memories.
32:43 Imagine telling his children  and grandchildren of what work he did.
32:47 Imagine having them meet others  who worked right alongside him.
32:51 Yes, a lasting monument to praise Jehovah —that’s what he was working on,
32:56 and that’s what you’ve been  working on.
32:59 Something to praise Jehovah,  to make his name known.
33:03 But imagine how thrilled Bezalel  is going to be when he learns
33:07 that his faithfulness and his actions  were recorded in God’s Word for all of us.
33:12 What a privilege that will be too!
33:15 What’s the lesson for us?
33:18 Don’t judge the quality  or appreciation of your work
33:21 by whether or not  you get to stay.
33:24 In our Bible reading  this last week,
33:26 2 Chronicles 15:7 was cited.
33:30 It says: ‘But you, be strong  and do not be discouraged,’
33:34 or “do not let your hands drop” down,  “for your activity will be rewarded.”
33:39 Yes, you don’t need  to be discouraged.
33:41 Like Bezalel, you have a lifetime of memories  to share and you can appreciate.
33:46 You’ll be able to bring your family  to facilities that you’ve helped build.
33:50 You’ll be able to point out  things that you did.
33:53 You’ll also have memories  that no one can take away from you,
33:57 and those  will be precious as well.
34:00 Maybe some of those bus rides  you’ll be able to talk about.
34:04 And I know  that the audience here
34:07 especially can appreciate  those bus rides.
34:10 A mechanic  told me once he was working
34:12 on the air conditioning  for the bus in the middle of the night.
34:15 He said,  “You do not want a hot bus
34:18 “full of 60 hot workers
34:21 stuck in midtown-Manhattan traffic  coming home.”
34:25 But think of those memories.
34:27 Think of the things that went right; think  of the things that maybe had a little glitch.
34:32 Those are memories you have,  and every time you get together with someone
34:36 who you served with,  you’re going to talk about that.
34:38 And what was the biggest frustration  that you had is now going to be something
34:41 you laugh about  and talk about for an eternity.
34:46 Memories that can never ever  be taken away from you.
34:50 So remember,  this is not your last assignment.
34:53 We don’t retire  from Jehovah’s service.
34:55 We don’t have a rocking chair  somewhere on a porch,
34:58 and now we’re just going  to rock ourselves into the sunset.
35:02 We have work to do, and Jehovah  wants you to be part of it.
35:06 So it’s just like . . .
35:08 If you have to leave Bethel,
35:11 one of the things  that someone had said before is:
35:13 “The best way to leave Bethel  is to take it with you when you go.
35:17 “Take your memories with you.
35:19 “Build enthusiasm  and appreciation for others in Bethel.
35:24 “Take your friendships,  and never stop volunteering
35:27 for any assignment  the organization needs.”
35:30 They need us.  They need you to do that work.
35:35 Finally, the third and last change  we want to talk about
35:39 has to do  with changing circumstances personally
35:43 for many in our family.
35:45 Many of our older members  of the family have served for decades.
35:50 They have witnessed  an exciting growth
35:52 in the history  of Jehovah’s people.
35:56 Maybe when Brooklyn  was the only buildings at Bethel,
36:01 then Kingdom Farm,  Mountain Farm, Wallkill, Patterson
36:05 —tremendous expansion —and now Warwick.
36:09 Many of our older ones at Bethel  have experienced all of that.
36:13 They have seen all of that come.
36:15 What a beautiful privilege  that they’ve had!
36:18 But maybe, some have been told  that they won’t be going
36:23 with their department to Wallkill  or even Warwick in some cases.
36:27 So that can be pretty disappointing.
36:30 That can stir  some pretty deep-seated emotions.
36:33 They might feel as the psalmist did  in Psalm 71:9, where he said:
36:37 “Do not cast me off in my old age;  do not abandon me
36:41 when my strength fails.”
36:44 But we must remember  that our changing circumstances
36:49 —whoever we are,  wherever we serve—have nothing to do
36:53 with how Jehovah views us.
36:56 So it doesn’t change our desire  to be used by him as well.
37:02 This last week  Brother Larson mentioned
37:06 Isaiah the 46th chapter,  and it’s an appropriate scripture
37:09 for us to consider when talking  about this particular subject as well.
37:14 Isaiah 46:4, it says:
37:18 “Until you grow old  I will be the same;
37:21 “until your hair is gray  I will keep bearing you.
37:25 “As I have done,
37:27 I will carry you  and bear you and rescue you.”
37:32 Jehovah has always done that for us.
37:35 And for you older members of the family  with many decades of faithful service,
37:42 you’ve shown us how  to let Jehovah do that,
37:45 so that you  can get the work done.
37:48 It’s that same unchangeable God
37:51 that helps us  continue to be stabilized.
37:55 It grounds us,  and it guards our heart,
37:59 so that we know  that Jehovah loves us
38:02 and cherishes us personally.
38:05 When our hair is gray  and our strength is gone, Jehovah carries us.
38:10 So we know, you brothers  and sisters did not come to Bethel
38:15 with the idea  that one day you would retire.
38:18 You have worked hard.  You didn’t plan for that day.
38:22 But Jehovah doesn’t view it that way.
38:24 We think about Daniel  in the 10th chapter.
38:28 Jehovah described Daniel  as a “very precious man.”
38:33 He was likely  around 100 years of age,
38:36 and yet he was  still very precious in Jehovah’s eyes
38:40 —even as you are.
38:42 So it’s important to remember  that just because we cannot do
38:45 what we once did, does not mean we cannot do anything at all.
38:50 We’d like to consider, finally,
38:52 the example  of the apostle John
38:56 to help us maybe  get a perspective on this.
38:59 Now, of course,  John was used mightily by Jehovah.
39:03 He was a man of action, of faith.
39:05 Jesus called him  and his brother the “Sons of Thunder.”
39:10 So they were people  who were full of action.
39:15 John 21:7 also says he’s described  as “the disciple whom Jesus loved.”
39:22 He sat directly next to Jesus  at mealtimes.
39:26 He was a very special friend.
39:28 Maybe even Jesus shared things  with him that He didn’t
39:31 with the other disciples  around Him.
39:35 He was one of the few  to witness the transfiguration.
39:39 He was one of the three  that accompanied Jesus
39:42 into the house of Jairus  to witness the resurrection of his daughter.
39:47 He even had the honor  of caring
39:50 for Jesus’ mother  after his death.
39:54 Still, after Jesus’ ascension  to heaven,
39:57 when all of this activity  was going on,
40:01 what did John do?
40:03 Well, he preached.
40:06 He was a faithful member  of the congregation.
40:09 He was with Peter when some  of the most fiery speeches were given,
40:14 miracles were performed,  and when they stood up to say:
40:17 ‘We will obey God  as ruler rather than men.’
40:21 All of those things show  that John was a man of faith.
40:25 But a long time went by
40:29 when we catch up with John  later in life.
40:32 In the meantime,  so much else had happened.
40:35 Many had written  their own Gospel, right?
40:37 Matthew had written it  some eight years after Jesus’ death.
40:41 Fifteen to seventeen years later,  Luke wrote his.
40:45 A few years after that,  Mark wrote his.
40:47 But not John,  he still hadn’t written his.
40:50 Sixty-three years later,  where do we find John?
40:54 Well, apparently where most Christians  were back then
40:56 —preaching or in prison.
40:59 So look at what it says,  Revelation 1:9,
41:02 Revelation 1:9.
41:05 Now imagine, he’s old;  he’s well into his 90’s.
41:10 He’s the last  of the apostles to be alive.
41:15 Revelation 1:9 says:  “I John, your brother
41:18 “and a sharer with you  in the tribulation and kingdom
41:21 “and endurance  in association with Jesus,
41:24 “was on the island called Patmos  for speaking about God
41:28 and bearing witness  concerning Jesus.”
41:32 John was old,  but he was active.
41:36 His faith was intact,
41:38 and he found himself  in prison.
41:42 But that’s not even  fully the point.
41:46 You see, John was yet to receive,  was just about to receive,
41:51 or had just received  what was arguably
41:54 the greatest privilege  he would ever have.
41:58 Yes, because Jehovah caused him  to see a thrilling vision of the future.
42:03 It brings it all the way down  to the time of the end
42:06 and the conclusion  of this system of things.
42:08 He got to pen  the vision of Revelation.
42:13 And then after that,  he got to write his Gospel
42:17 and three other books  with his name.
42:20 Do you think he was worthless?
42:23 No.  He was at an all-time peak.
42:26 His value was the best ever.
42:29 But isn’t it amazing!
42:31 We think sometimes that maybe  there’s nothing left for us to do,
42:34 but that’s not  how Jehovah sees it.
42:37 What a grand privilege for John  to cap some 70 years of faithful service!
42:41 What’s the lesson?
42:42 We never lose our value  to Jehovah or his organization
42:47 as long as we remain faithful.
42:49 And it’s true  that for our older ones here at Bethel,
42:52 you’ve taught us  as young ones coming into Bethel
42:57 what it means  to work for Jehovah.
42:59 What it means  to really put yourself out for that.
43:02 The example I always think of  is when it snows outside in Brooklyn.
43:05 We have a nice arrangement.
43:07 The Transportation Office will go out;
43:10 they’ll actually see  if the roads can be traveled.
43:11 They’ll call the Bethel Office.
43:13 The Bethel Office  will call the Branch Committee.
43:15 We’ll put an announcement together:  It’s too snowy to go out.
43:18 You know what we spend  the most time on?
43:20 Trying to figure out how to tell  the senior members of the family
43:23 it’s OK  not to go to work.
43:28 You would think we’re trying  to make them renounce their faith.
43:33 And don’t let those sidewalks dry up  before noon, because they’ll be out there.
43:38 They’ll be going to work.
43:40 Yes, you have taught us  how to be
43:44 really devoted servants of Jehovah,  and you will continue to do that.
43:48 Your example is one that comes  like a tree that has maturity.
43:53 It’s so much more valuable  than just a sapling
43:57 that is waiting  to produce fruitage.
43:59 So it is that we know you’re  like “big trees of righteousness” to Jehovah.
44:05 So these are areas  that all of us face.
44:09 We haven’t covered them all.
44:12 It’s just a few  we’ve considered tonight.
44:14 But we recognize that change is a fact  of life, and we’re all affected by it.
44:19 It’s going to continue;  we expect it to.
44:22 But we’ve all learned that the one thing  that doesn’t change is Jehovah.
44:27 He’s the one who will keep us;  he’s the one who will ground us,
44:31 and he is our refuge  and our strength.
44:34 In our Bible examples today,  do we have one that can help us
44:37 in Bezalel, in Esther,
44:39 in the apostle John,  and their faithful examples?
44:44 When we go back  to our illustration of sailing,
44:47 rarely is a boat able
44:50 to get somewhere  sailing in a direct line.
44:53 Now, sometimes you’ll have great weather  and that can happen.
44:56 But when sailing into the wind,
44:59 a sailor needs to employ  what they call tacking,
45:02 and the organization has used that  in talking about maneuvering and changes.
45:06 But in short, it means that they steer  upwind in a zigzag fashion
45:11 so that they get the wind hitting  both sides of the sail,
45:14 and it pushes them forward  in spite of riding into the wind.
45:19 For us,  we have the advantage.
45:23 Jesus is at the helm.
45:25 He knows exactly where  he wants us to be going.
45:28 We’re not alone  in going through changes at Bethel either.
45:32 First Corinthians 12:25  tells us:
45:35 “There should be  no division in the body,
45:39 but its members should have  mutual concern for one another.”
45:41 So our concern for others  should help us
45:44 to not just think  about ourselves.
45:47 We have many who  are changing assignments even now
45:51 —temporary workers who are leaving, Bethel family members being reassigned,
45:55 and others  who will be moving very soon.
45:58 These are changes,  and they affect us.
46:01 But Jehovah  is that same person,
46:04 even as we read  in the 46th Psalm.
46:07 The One who can be  with us no matter what.
46:11 Bigger,  more exciting changes?
46:15 I appreciate Brother Lett saying that,  even in his Watchtower study today.
46:20 Armageddon is coming.
46:23 Does it get  any bigger than that?
46:25 Wickedness will be  a thing of the past.
46:29 Paradise will be real  and here.
46:34 The resurrection will happen,
46:37 and old age and death  will be a thing of the past.
46:40 These are changes we can believe in,  and we can look forward to.
46:45 When we think about that,
46:48 whatever changes come our way, we can be confident that
46:52 we will not just go through them,  but we can actually embrace them.
46:56 We can even grow  from them;
46:59 we can even make sure  we’re moving ahead with them.
47:02 We can be sure  that our unchanging God, Jehovah,
47:06 will stick by us,
47:08 and he’s our rewarder  everlastingly.

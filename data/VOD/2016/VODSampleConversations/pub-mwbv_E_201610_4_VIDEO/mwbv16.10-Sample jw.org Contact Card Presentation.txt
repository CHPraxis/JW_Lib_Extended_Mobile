00:00:01 I’ve really enjoyed talking with you.
00:00:04 I have to get off at the next stop,
00:00:06 but I’d like to give you this.
00:00:08 I know you mentioned that you don’t read much,
00:00:11 but I think you’ll really like this website.
00:00:13 It has free information and videos for your whole family.
00:00:17 Thanks. I’ll take a look at it.
00:00:19 You’re welcome. Have a great day!
00:00:24 So, soon the whole earth will be a paradise
00:00:27 and there’ll be no more sickness.
00:00:29 I wish I had faith like yours.
00:00:31 It would really help me to cope with this health problem.
00:00:35 Well, you know, the hope I just described
00:00:37 is found in the Bible.
00:00:41 This card takes you to a website
00:00:43 that has more information.
00:00:45 The code on the back directs you to a video
00:00:47 that briefly explains why there are so many problems in the world.
00:00:50 Oh, thank you.
00:00:52 I will definitely watch it when I go home.
00:00:54 Next patient, please.
00:00:56 Well, it looks like they’re ready for me.
00:00:58 Thank you for the card and for listening.
00:01:04 Hey, Sabrina, where did you get that information for your class report?
00:01:08 I found it on this website, jw.org.
00:01:11 It has a whole section for teens, and everything is free.
00:01:14 Thanks!
00:01:15 I’ll check it out after class.
00:01:20 Hi, would you like something to read?
00:01:22 Do you have anything in Korean?
00:01:24 Unfortunately, we don’t today.
00:01:26 But our website, jw.org, does have literature in Korean.
00:01:29 If you have a moment, I can show you.
00:01:31 OK, great!

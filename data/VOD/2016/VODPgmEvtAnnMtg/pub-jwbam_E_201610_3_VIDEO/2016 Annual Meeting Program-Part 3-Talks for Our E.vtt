00:01.985 --> 00:06.022
Brother Mark Sanderson
has labored over his material


00:06.022 --> 00:09.059
and is looking forward to
presenting his talk.


00:09.058 --> 00:13.530
It’s entitled
“Your Labor Is Not in Vain.”


00:13.530 --> 00:17.467
Brother Sanderson,
you have our ears.


00:17.467 --> 00:21.437
The date was
September 8, 1922,


00:21.437 --> 00:23.507
Cedar Point, Ohio.


00:23.507 --> 00:27.010
Brother Rutherford,
before that assembled crowd,


00:27.010 --> 00:29.678
said those words
that still ring in our ears.


00:29.678 --> 00:33.550
He said: “Behold!
The King reigns!


00:33.550 --> 00:36.820
“You are his publicity agents.


00:36.820 --> 00:41.825
“Therefore advertise,
advertise, advertise


00:41.825 --> 00:44.893
the King and his kingdom.”


00:44.893 --> 00:49.298
Well, what a call to action that was
by Brother Rutherford.


00:49.298 --> 00:51.600
And in those few words,


00:51.600 --> 00:53.570
Brother Rutherford showed


00:53.570 --> 00:57.640
that he recognized something
that is very important.


00:57.640 --> 01:02.345
The faithful men and women
that were in that audience


01:02.345 --> 01:06.817
and so many others
who have followed them since


01:06.817 --> 01:10.520
were to be
Jehovah’s publicity agents.


01:10.520 --> 01:13.923
They were to be preachers and teachers


01:13.923 --> 01:16.793
of the good news of God’s Kingdom.


01:16.793 --> 01:19.595
Now, that’s a simple fact,


01:19.595 --> 01:23.298
but it reveals something amazing


01:23.298 --> 01:26.101
about our heavenly Father, Jehovah.


01:26.102 --> 01:29.272
Although he is so almighty,


01:29.272 --> 01:32.109
although just one angel


01:32.108 --> 01:36.980
could kill 185,000 in one night,


01:36.980 --> 01:40.817
we know Jehovah
could use any miraculous means


01:40.817 --> 01:44.020
in order to accomplish
this preaching work.


01:44.020 --> 01:48.458
But how has Jehovah
chosen to accomplish it?


01:48.458 --> 01:52.261
By using imperfect,


01:52.262 --> 01:57.267
ordinary men and women
like you and like me


01:57.267 --> 02:00.837
in order to accomplish
the greatest preaching work


02:00.837 --> 02:03.874
that has ever been accomplished in history.


02:03.873 --> 02:07.210
It reminds us of what
the apostle Paul wrote here


02:07.210 --> 02:09.345
in 
1 Corinthians chapter 1.


02:09.345 --> 02:12.000
Will you open your Bibles
and read it with me?


02:16.585 --> 02:21.190
First Corinthians 1:26,
the apostle Paul said:


02:21.190 --> 02:24.127
“For you see his calling of you, brothers,


02:24.127 --> 02:27.997
“that there are not many wise
in a fleshly way,


02:27.997 --> 02:32.402
“not many powerful, not many of noble birth,


02:32.402 --> 02:35.739
“but God chose the foolish things
of the world


02:35.738 --> 02:38.173
“to put the wise men to shame;


02:38.173 --> 02:41.176
“and God chose the weak things
of the world


02:41.177 --> 02:43.880
“to put the strong things to shame;


02:43.880 --> 02:47.283
“and God chose the insignificant things
of the world


02:47.283 --> 02:51.420
“and the things looked down on,
the things that are not,


02:51.420 --> 02:54.823
“to bring to nothing the things that are,


02:54.823 --> 02:59.461
so that no one might boast
in the sight of God.”


02:59.462 --> 03:02.332
Well, perhaps those in Corinth


03:02.332 --> 03:05.902
thought that being a new movement,


03:05.902 --> 03:09.439
Jehovah would raise up
people who were powerful


03:09.438 --> 03:15.278
—people from important families
or people who had great worldly wisdom—


03:15.278 --> 03:19.415
but that was not the means
that Jehovah was going to use.


03:19.415 --> 03:22.218
He was going to use people
who were described


03:22.218 --> 03:25.621
as “unlettered and ordinary.”


03:25.622 --> 03:28.457
Well, for what purpose?


03:28.457 --> 03:33.362
Well, really, to magnify him
and to magnify his almightiness.


03:33.362 --> 03:36.065
He could use these imperfect people


03:36.065 --> 03:39.068
to accomplish this tremendous work


03:39.068 --> 03:41.703
and, really, so that no human


03:41.703 --> 03:44.873
could ever boast
in what was accomplished.


03:44.873 --> 03:48.110
Well, when those words
of Brother Rutherford went out


03:48.110 --> 03:51.513
—that call to action—
our brothers got busy.


03:51.513 --> 03:55.651
Brother Melvin Sargent,
who was baptized in 1912


03:55.652 --> 04:00.557
and who was present there in Cedar Point
to hear those words, said this:


04:00.557 --> 04:03.459
“Those of us inside
the Lord’s organization


04:03.458 --> 04:06.061
“have tried,
in every way possible,


04:06.062 --> 04:09.632
“to turn their attention
to the message of life.


04:09.632 --> 04:13.770
“We have used slogans,
full-page advertisements,


04:13.770 --> 04:17.807
“radio, sound cars,
portable phonographs,


04:17.807 --> 04:19.975
“gigantic conventions,


04:19.975 --> 04:23.813
“parades of information-walkers
carrying signs,


04:23.813 --> 04:27.516
and a growing army
of house-to-house ministers.”


04:27.517 --> 04:29.085
How true!


04:29.085 --> 04:31.920
And perhaps
some of you shared in some of those


04:31.920 --> 04:35.190
different activities,
and you used those tools.


04:35.190 --> 04:37.860
Well, what about today?


04:37.860 --> 04:42.865
Today, brothers, we have amazing tools
to help us to accomplish the work,


04:42.865 --> 04:45.735
things that we
could never even have imagined:


04:45.735 --> 04:49.905
jw.org, the JW Library app,


04:49.905 --> 04:54.210
our Language app, JW Broadcasting,


04:54.210 --> 04:57.280
as well as literature that’s now available


04:57.280 --> 05:01.250
in literally hundreds
and hundreds of languages.


05:01.250 --> 05:03.285
But, brothers,


05:03.285 --> 05:07.723
no matter how wonderful
any of these tools are,


05:07.723 --> 05:09.825
no matter how many tools


05:09.825 --> 05:14.163
we ever produce,
we cannot forget one simple point:


05:14.163 --> 05:18.133
Tools need users.


05:18.133 --> 05:21.603
And that means
that every one of you


05:21.603 --> 05:25.675
—every publisher
of the good news of God’s Kingdom—


05:25.675 --> 05:28.343
is absolutely essential


05:28.343 --> 05:32.415
and is absolutely needed
to accomplish this work.


05:32.415 --> 05:35.000
Do you agree with me?


05:44.060 --> 05:47.763
And we have to say
that as a Governing Body, as we travel,


05:47.763 --> 05:51.833
we see you preaching boldly
from house to house.


05:51.833 --> 05:54.870
We see your literature carts in airports,


05:54.870 --> 05:58.173
on public corners, in train stations.


05:58.173 --> 06:02.245
The work that you are accomplishing
is amazing,


06:02.245 --> 06:06.115
and you are to be commended
for your hard work in preaching.


06:06.115 --> 06:08.517
It’s much like the
apostle Paul said here


06:08.517 --> 06:13.055
in 1 Corinthians 15:58,


06:13.055 --> 06:16.758
he said:
“Therefore, my beloved brothers,


06:16.758 --> 06:19.828
“be steadfast, immovable,


06:19.828 --> 06:23.900
“always having plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,


06:23.900 --> 06:27.703
“knowing that your labor is not in vain


06:27.703 --> 06:29.705
in connection with the Lord.”


06:29.705 --> 06:31.540
Well, that’s what you’re doing! 


06:31.540 --> 06:35.878
You see, you have 
“plenty to do in the work of the Lord.”


06:35.878 --> 06:39.215
But, let’s ask another question.


06:39.215 --> 06:44.220
We know, of course,
that our “labor is not in vain,”


06:44.220 --> 06:49.225
but could we from time to time
come to that wrong conclusion?


06:49.225 --> 06:51.527
Could we begin to think


06:51.527 --> 06:55.030
that our labor really is in vain?


06:55.030 --> 06:58.433
Well, let’s consider
three different areas


06:58.433 --> 07:01.870
where we might wrongfully
come to that conclusion.


07:01.870 --> 07:04.373
Here’s the first.


07:04.373 --> 07:07.310
With advancing age


07:07.310 --> 07:10.447
or with increasing health challenges,


07:10.447 --> 07:12.682
we may begin to think:


07:12.682 --> 07:16.685
‘Well, my voice
is really very, very small.


07:16.685 --> 07:20.322
‘I really cannot contribute very much anymore


07:20.322 --> 07:22.692
to the preaching of the good news.’


07:22.692 --> 07:26.195
Well, if that’s the way
you may have felt,


07:26.195 --> 07:29.532
it might be encouraging
to think about what we did today


07:29.532 --> 07:32.702
—the release
of our brand new songbook.


07:32.702 --> 07:34.704
Now, isn’t it true?


07:34.703 --> 07:38.941
We love to listen to our choral singing.


07:38.942 --> 07:41.877
But now, when you listen
to that choral singing,


07:41.877 --> 07:44.314
what is it
that makes it beautiful?


07:44.313 --> 07:48.016
Is it the fact that 
there are two or three loud,


07:48.017 --> 07:51.420
booming voices that overpower everyone?


07:51.420 --> 07:54.623
No, the beauty lies


07:54.623 --> 07:59.628
in all of the voices coming together,
harmonizing,


07:59.628 --> 08:03.731
making beautiful music that praises Jehovah.


08:03.732 --> 08:06.369
So, what can we learn from that?


08:06.368 --> 08:10.138
Well, you see,
whether our voice is loud


08:10.138 --> 08:14.810
or whether our voice is very soft
—or very small—


08:14.810 --> 08:19.815
we all can contribute
to this wonderful chorus


08:19.815 --> 08:23.318
that’s being sung around this earth
to praise Jehovah.


08:23.318 --> 08:27.121
And, as Brother Splane
so nicely mentioned in his talk,


08:27.122 --> 08:32.027
the principle of 2 Corinthians 8:12


08:32.027 --> 08:34.964
must be very powerful in our minds.


08:34.963 --> 08:37.400
You see, there,
the apostle Paul said:


08:37.400 --> 08:41.237
“For if the readiness is there first,


08:41.237 --> 08:46.242
“it is especially acceptable according
to what a person has,


08:46.242 --> 08:49.645
not according to what
a person does not have.”


08:49.645 --> 08:53.182
Well, now, we apply that
to many different types of giving.


08:53.182 --> 08:57.854
We apply it to our literal contributions
of material things.


08:57.853 --> 09:01.556
But we also can apply it
to our use of our time,


09:01.557 --> 09:04.460
our energy, our abilities


09:04.460 --> 09:08.130
—everything that we give
for the preaching of this good news.


09:08.130 --> 09:12.235
So the question is not,
What do you not have?


09:12.235 --> 09:15.203
But the question is,
What do you have?


09:15.203 --> 09:17.306
Do you have a voice?


09:17.307 --> 09:21.077
Well, whether it’s strong or soft,
use it.


09:21.077 --> 09:24.447
Continue to use it to praise Jehovah.


09:24.447 --> 09:27.784
If you use sign language to communicate,


09:27.783 --> 09:30.085
well, then, use your hands


09:30.085 --> 09:33.923
to be able to tell others
about the good news of God’s Kingdom.


09:33.923 --> 09:38.593
Just recently, a brother sent me
an experience of a Bible student


09:38.593 --> 09:41.896
in India who is both deaf


09:41.897 --> 09:45.802
and also was born with no arms.


09:45.802 --> 09:48.070
Now, how can this man communicate?


09:48.070 --> 09:49.405
Can you imagine?


09:49.405 --> 09:53.142
He’s learned to do sign language
with his feet,


09:53.142 --> 09:57.947
and he is able to communicate
and express his voice in that way.


09:57.947 --> 09:59.349
Isn’t that wonderful?


09:59.348 --> 10:04.353
We can use what we have
to praise Jehovah.


10:04.353 --> 10:07.523
And, I have to say,
the Governing Body


10:07.523 --> 10:12.193
deeply appreciates
all of the hard work that you brothers


10:12.193 --> 10:16.665
are doing whether your voice
is loud and strong or quite weak.


10:16.665 --> 10:20.937
We appreciate every one of you
and the work that you’re doing


10:20.937 --> 10:25.074
in preaching the good news
of God’s Kingdom.


10:25.073 --> 10:28.143
But now let’s talk
about a second area


10:28.143 --> 10:31.846
where we might think
that our labor is in vain.


10:31.847 --> 10:34.084
This is when we say:


10:34.083 --> 10:38.586
“Well, someone’s work
is really far better than mine.


10:38.587 --> 10:41.857
They can do
so much more than I can.”


10:41.857 --> 10:44.394
Well, it is a human tendency


10:44.393 --> 10:47.663
for us to want to
compare ourselves with others.


10:47.663 --> 10:51.800
But, what is the counsel
that we have from God’s Word in this regard?


10:51.800 --> 10:56.000
Let’s read Galatians 6:4.


11:00.542 --> 11:04.280
Galatians 6:4, it says:


11:04.280 --> 11:08.917
“But let each one
examine his own actions,


11:08.917 --> 11:12.589
“and then he will have cause
for rejoicing in regard


11:12.588 --> 11:14.656
“to himself alone,


11:14.657 --> 11:18.760
and not in comparison with the other person.”


11:18.760 --> 11:22.598
Yes, we have to look at what we can do


11:22.598 --> 11:26.468
and what we can contribute
to the work ourselves.


11:26.468 --> 11:29.771
And in this regard,
we have a beautiful example


11:29.772 --> 11:33.942
that comes from our modern-day history
that I’d like to share with you.


11:33.942 --> 11:38.114
It’s the example
of a brother named Adolf Weber.


11:38.113 --> 11:42.685
Now, Brother Weber was baptized
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania,


11:42.685 --> 11:46.555
all the way back in the year 1890.


11:46.555 --> 11:48.590
Now, that’s a long time ago,
isn’t it?


11:48.590 --> 11:50.658
Now, who was this man?


11:50.658 --> 11:52.895
He was a Swiss woodcutter.


11:52.895 --> 11:54.963
He had come to America,


11:54.963 --> 11:58.766
and he worked
with Brother Russell as a gardener.


11:58.767 --> 12:01.937
He obtained a very deep knowledge
of the Scriptures


12:01.937 --> 12:03.939
from working with Brother Russell.


12:03.938 --> 12:08.010
After a time, Brother Weber
wanted with all his heart


12:08.010 --> 12:10.980
to go back to Europe and begin preaching


12:10.980 --> 12:13.948
in the French-language territories.


12:13.948 --> 12:15.985
But, now, who was he?


12:15.985 --> 12:18.120
Well, the yearbook—
I’ll quote it.


12:18.120 --> 12:21.490
I won’t try to make any judgments
because I didn’t know Brother Weber.


12:21.490 --> 12:24.460
But here’s what it said,
‘Brother Weber was


12:24.460 --> 12:29.165
a simple man
of peasantlike appearance.’


12:29.165 --> 12:31.567
Well, if you see his picture
in the Proclaimers book,


12:31.567 --> 12:33.802
you might agree with that.


12:33.802 --> 12:37.405
But, at the same time,
the yearbook said:


12:37.405 --> 12:40.042
“He was a devout, mature Christian


12:40.042 --> 12:44.280
who knew well the English,
French, and German languages.”


12:44.280 --> 12:48.283
In fact, he translated
the Studies in the Scriptures


12:48.283 --> 12:51.986
and other early publications
into French.


12:51.987 --> 12:54.424
Well, as soon as
he got back to Switzerland,


12:54.423 --> 12:56.458
Brother Weber got busy.


12:56.458 --> 12:58.826
He placed advertisements


12:58.827 --> 13:02.665
in French-language religious newspapers
and magazines


13:02.665 --> 13:07.235
for Volume 1 of the Studies in the Scriptures
and other books of Brother Russell.


13:07.235 --> 13:09.305
Well, as a result,


13:09.305 --> 13:12.307
people began to order
Brother Russell’s publications.


13:12.307 --> 13:16.112
They began to subscribe
to The Watchtower in French.


13:16.112 --> 13:19.715
Brother Weber
went on big preaching campaigns.


13:19.715 --> 13:22.852
He would go through
Switzerland placing tracts.


13:22.852 --> 13:26.722
He would go to France and Belgium,
and he would meet with people


13:26.722 --> 13:30.592
who had ordered literature
or who had subscribed to The Watchtower,


13:30.592 --> 13:33.695
all the while supporting himself


13:33.695 --> 13:37.298
by doing woodcutting or gardening.


13:37.298 --> 13:42.303
But now, were all of these efforts
blessed by Jehovah?


13:42.303 --> 13:45.340
Yes, because throughout that territory


13:45.340 --> 13:47.810
—in Switzerland,
in France, in Belgium—


13:47.810 --> 13:52.815
many began to associate
and began to serve Jehovah.


13:52.815 --> 13:55.250
But then what happened?


13:55.250 --> 14:00.255
In 1912, Brother Russell
was on a trip through Europe,


14:00.255 --> 14:04.760
and he decided to arrange
to open a French-language office


14:04.760 --> 14:06.928
in Geneva, Switzerland.


14:06.928 --> 14:10.365
And so when Brother Russell
looked at the candidates available,


14:10.365 --> 14:13.202
he felt that there were other brothers


14:13.202 --> 14:18.207
who were better educated
who should now take over the work.


14:18.207 --> 14:21.510
Well, now,
how would that affect Brother Weber?


14:21.510 --> 14:24.247
Here this humble man
who had worked so hard


14:24.247 --> 14:28.117
to get everything established
was now being asked, as it were,


14:28.117 --> 14:30.352
to turn over the reins.


14:30.352 --> 14:33.189
Well, Brother Weber didn’t hesitate a bit.


14:33.188 --> 14:36.558
The yearbook said
he gladly stepped down


14:36.558 --> 14:40.061
in favor
of the more educated brothers.


14:40.062 --> 14:43.399
Well, was he discouraged?
Did he give up?


14:43.398 --> 14:46.168
Did he try to compare himself
with those other men?


14:46.168 --> 14:49.971
No, the yearbook went on to say
that he kept a good spirit.


14:49.972 --> 14:53.742
He continued making his pilgrim visits
to the congregations


14:53.742 --> 14:57.880
and visiting the isolated brothers
who spoke French.


14:57.880 --> 14:59.915
But what happened?


14:59.915 --> 15:02.718
Do you know
the end of the story?


15:02.718 --> 15:04.820
Well, just after a few years,


15:04.820 --> 15:09.090
those well-educated brothers
who had been placed in charge of the work—


15:09.090 --> 15:11.127
Do you know what happened to them?


15:11.127 --> 15:14.029
They all proved to be unfaithful.


15:14.028 --> 15:16.031
And what happened?


15:16.032 --> 15:18.567
Well, where’s Brother Weber?


15:18.567 --> 15:23.172
We have to go and find this dear,
humble man and bring him back.


15:23.172 --> 15:26.709
He had to go
and strengthen the brothers,


15:26.708 --> 15:31.713
encourage them, readjust them,
which he gladly did.


15:31.713 --> 15:35.616
Despite the many challenges
that this brother experienced,


15:35.617 --> 15:39.154
he continued to strengthen
and fortify the brothers


15:39.153 --> 15:41.490
until he finished his earthly course


15:41.490 --> 15:44.493
sometime about the year 1947.


15:44.493 --> 15:47.528
What’s the lesson that we can learn?


15:47.528 --> 15:49.765
See, Brother Weber


15:49.765 --> 15:53.535
demonstrated the truth of Galatians 6:4.


15:53.535 --> 15:57.038
He proved what his own work was.


15:57.038 --> 15:59.775
He was content to be a lesser one


15:59.775 --> 16:03.278
and to use his abilities and his spirituality


16:03.278 --> 16:05.981
to be a source
of encouragement to others.


16:05.982 --> 16:08.050
He did not spend all of his time


16:08.050 --> 16:12.487
comparing himself with others,
but he brought what he had


16:12.487 --> 16:15.457
and he used it to honor Jehovah.


16:15.457 --> 16:17.894
Well, his labor was not in vain.


16:17.893 --> 16:21.996
Do you know in the area
where he opened up the work so long ago,


16:21.997 --> 16:26.402
there are well over
100,000 publishers


16:26.402 --> 16:28.637
who are praising Jehovah’s name?


16:28.637 --> 16:31.440
What a powerful lesson we can learn


16:31.440 --> 16:35.943
from this simple,
humble brother, Adolf Weber.


16:35.943 --> 16:39.481
But, now, let’s talk about our final area


16:39.482 --> 16:44.085
where we might begin to think
that our labor is in vain.


16:44.085 --> 16:48.023
Perhaps some of you here
have been serving


16:48.023 --> 16:51.526
at Bethel for decades
—many, many years—


16:51.527 --> 16:54.830
and now you have been
reassigned to the field.


16:54.830 --> 16:58.533
Others of you
may be circuit overseers


16:58.533 --> 17:00.935
who have reached the age of 70,


17:00.935 --> 17:05.073
and now you’ve begun
to serve as regular or as special pioneers.


17:05.073 --> 17:08.176
Well, now, should any
of you in that situation


17:08.177 --> 17:12.214
feel that your labors have been in vain?


17:12.213 --> 17:15.050
Absolutely not!


17:15.050 --> 17:18.887
Quite frankly, brothers,
if possible,


17:18.887 --> 17:23.825
all of us at Bethel should return
to the field, if it were possible.


17:23.825 --> 17:28.830
Because what did
Jesus say at Matthew 9:37?


17:28.830 --> 17:32.167
“Yes, the harvest is great,


17:32.167 --> 17:34.670
“but the workers are few.


17:34.670 --> 17:37.873
“Therefore, beg the Master
of the harvest


17:37.873 --> 17:41.710
to send out workers into his harvest.”


17:41.710 --> 17:45.580
Yes, the workers
are needed out in the field.


17:45.580 --> 17:49.785
And these dear brothers and sisters
who have returned to the field


17:49.785 --> 17:52.153
who are now in the pioneer service,


17:52.153 --> 17:55.490
they are accomplishing tremendous work.


17:55.490 --> 17:59.027
Just as the Gilead School
now has been designed


17:59.027 --> 18:01.564
to train special full-time servants


18:01.563 --> 18:05.100
to strengthen and stabilize,


18:05.100 --> 18:10.105
well, now these ones who have returned
to the field are having a powerful


18:10.105 --> 18:12.707
and strengthening effect
on the congregations.


18:12.707 --> 18:16.412
They’re sharing their experience,
their maturity,


18:16.412 --> 18:19.380
the many wonderful lessons
that they learned


18:19.380 --> 18:24.385
from all of those years either
in Bethel service or in traveling work.


18:24.385 --> 18:28.757
Now, you know the Governing Body
receives many letters from the field


18:28.757 --> 18:30.825
—many letters of appreciation.


18:30.825 --> 18:34.563
But I’d like to just quote
from one that we recently received.


18:34.563 --> 18:37.900
A sister wrote to the Governing Body
and she said this:


18:37.900 --> 18:42.170
“I want to thank you
for sending into the field


18:42.170 --> 18:45.607
“those who have served
in special full-time service.


18:45.607 --> 18:49.979
“While I cannot imagine
how hard the decision must have been,


18:49.978 --> 18:53.548
“I know I have benefited 
beyond words


18:53.548 --> 18:57.151
“from having such dear ones 
in my congregation.


18:57.152 --> 19:01.022
“They are truly
a treasure from Jehovah.


19:01.022 --> 19:03.392
“What a blessing to all those


19:03.392 --> 19:06.529
“that have such ones in their congregation!


19:06.528 --> 19:09.665
I thank you so much!”


19:09.665 --> 19:11.900
Well, now,
that’s just one letter.


19:11.900 --> 19:13.968
But those words have been echoed


19:13.968 --> 19:17.940
by publishers in this country
and all around the world


19:17.940 --> 19:21.510
who have received these
well-qualified individuals


19:21.510 --> 19:23.545
coming to their congregations.


19:23.545 --> 19:25.613
So, dear brothers and sisters,


19:25.613 --> 19:30.151
we’d like to say to all those
of you who have been reassigned


19:30.152 --> 19:34.624
how much we love you,
how much we respect you,


19:34.623 --> 19:37.558
how much we appreciate your work.


19:37.558 --> 19:41.000
“Your labor is not in vain”!


19:59.915 --> 20:04.887
Well, it truly is thrilling to be a part
of Jehovah’s organization at this time.


20:04.887 --> 20:09.190
From those small beginnings
back in 1922 until today,


20:09.190 --> 20:12.693
it’s amazing to see
what has been accomplished


20:12.693 --> 20:17.465
—now more than 8 million publishers 
of the good news.


20:17.465 --> 20:21.803
Our magnificent 
and our wonderful God, Jehovah, 


20:21.803 --> 20:25.940
has chosen to accomplish
this tremendous preaching work


20:25.940 --> 20:29.277
using ordinary, imperfect people.


20:29.277 --> 20:32.714
And we have been given
the tremendous privilege


20:32.713 --> 20:34.850
to be his fellow workers.


20:34.850 --> 20:39.855
Brothers, are you determined
to continue to preach along with us


20:39.855 --> 20:43.000
until we say that this work 
is finally completed?


21:07.782 --> 21:11.987
Then may all of us have
“plenty to do in the work of the Lord”


21:11.987 --> 21:14.022
with full confidence


21:14.022 --> 21:18.000
that our labor will never be in vain.


21:29.370 --> 21:33.575
We certainly want to thank Mark
for that fine talk,


21:33.575 --> 21:38.000
and it’s encouraging to know
that our labor will never be in vain.


21:39.080 --> 21:43.118
So Jehovah remembers
us for the effort that we put forth


21:43.118 --> 21:48.000
in our service,
and he remembers us for good.


21:49.090 --> 21:54.495
Next, we have Brother Gerrit Lösch
with a rousing subject for us.


21:54.495 --> 21:59.000
The theme is
“Be a Conqueror.”


22:00.568 --> 22:04.806
The English word “conqueror”
refers to one that conquers.


22:04.807 --> 22:09.745
To conquer means
“to defeat someone or something.”


22:09.745 --> 22:12.947
The Spanish explorers and warriors


22:12.947 --> 22:17.952
who successfully conquered
much of America in the 16th century


22:17.952 --> 22:22.424
are called conquistadores, or conquerors.


22:22.423 --> 22:28.330
One of them was Hernán Cortés,
who conquered the Aztec Empire.


22:28.330 --> 22:30.432
At the peak, the Spanish Empire


22:30.432 --> 22:33.902
ruled over 19.4 million


22:33.902 --> 22:36.639
square kilometers,


22:36.638 --> 22:42.843
or 7.5 million square miles.


22:42.843 --> 22:46.448
But who conquered more land
than the Spanish?


22:46.448 --> 22:50.251
The Mongols and the British.


22:50.252 --> 22:54.089
At its greatest extent,
the British Empire was known


22:54.088 --> 22:57.491
as the largest empire in history,


22:57.492 --> 23:01.497
as it covered more than
13,000,000 square miles,


23:01.497 --> 23:05.234
or 33.7 million square kilometers,


23:05.233 --> 23:07.668
which is approximately a quarter


23:07.668 --> 23:11.338
of the earth’s total land area.


23:11.338 --> 23:14.675
Despite its overseas holdings,


23:14.675 --> 23:19.000
it was barely bigger than
the Mongol Empire under Kublai Khan.


23:20.182 --> 23:22.184
The British Empire was bigger


23:22.183 --> 23:26.888
only because of its overseas landholdings.


23:26.888 --> 23:30.158
The Mongols were a nomadic people


23:30.158 --> 23:34.595
who originated from the grassland plateau
of what is today Mongolia,


23:34.595 --> 23:37.232
in central and northeast Asia.


23:37.232 --> 23:39.234
Their speedy conquests,


23:39.233 --> 23:43.971
beginning in the early 13th century
of our Common Era,


23:43.972 --> 23:46.842
changed the face of Asia
and half of Europe.


23:46.842 --> 23:49.544
In just 25 years,


23:49.543 --> 23:52.513
the Mongols subjugated the inhabitants


23:52.513 --> 23:56.283
of more territories than the Romans


23:56.283 --> 24:00.021
had conquered in four centuries.


24:00.022 --> 24:04.994
At the peak of their power,
they ruled from Vietnam to Hungary


24:04.993 --> 24:08.396
(a distance of about 5,500 miles,


24:08.397 --> 24:11.265
or 8,700 kilometers)


24:11.265 --> 24:15.337
and from Siberia to India


24:15.337 --> 24:19.307
—the largest contiguous land empire


24:19.307 --> 24:24.000
in recorded history,
including modern times.


24:25.947 --> 24:30.319
Then there was Hitler
who saw himself as a world conqueror.


24:30.318 --> 24:32.553
He promoted the slogan


24:32.553 --> 24:35.390
“Today, Germany belongs to us;


24:35.390 --> 24:39.060
tomorrow, the whole world.”


24:39.060 --> 24:45.967
His attempt to conquer
the world failed miserably.


24:45.967 --> 24:49.670
How about conquests in Bible times?


24:49.670 --> 24:52.273
After the Exodus of the Israelites


24:52.273 --> 24:55.876
from Egypt in 1513 before our Common Era,


24:55.877 --> 25:00.249
Jehovah told the Israelites
to conquer the land of Canaan.


25:00.248 --> 25:03.185
They were afraid and disobeyed.


25:03.185 --> 25:07.922
Besides Moses,
only Joshua and Caleb were willing to fight.


25:07.922 --> 25:10.359
Numbers 13:30 says:


25:10.358 --> 25:12.493
“Then Caleb tried to calm the people


25:12.493 --> 25:14.761
“as they stood before Moses by saying:


25:14.762 --> 25:18.967
“‘Let us go up immediately, 
and we are sure to take possession of it, 


25:18.967 --> 25:23.104
because we can surely conquer it.’”


25:23.103 --> 25:25.140
For their lack of faith,


25:25.140 --> 25:29.343
the Israelites had to wander
for 40 years in the wilderness.


25:29.343 --> 25:35.583
After that, they conquered Canaan
during a period of about five years.


25:35.583 --> 25:39.353
In King Jehoshaphat’s day,
Jehovah caused a victory


25:39.353 --> 25:42.223
over the Ammonites, Moabites,
and Edomites


25:42.223 --> 25:45.760
from Seir—an alliance of nations.


25:45.760 --> 25:49.263
Israel did not conquer in their own strength,


25:49.263 --> 25:52.000
but Jehovah gave them the victory 


25:52.000 --> 25:56.337
by confusing the enemy alliance
so that they killed each other,


25:56.337 --> 26:02.000
according to 2 Chronicles 20:1-4.


26:03.278 --> 26:06.815
What about conquests
in the time of the end?


26:06.815 --> 26:10.518
Do you know a world conqueror
that conquered a larger area


26:10.518 --> 26:15.123
than the Mongol and the British Empires?


26:15.123 --> 26:19.860
Well, Revelation 6:2 gives the answer.


26:19.860 --> 26:23.000
We can read about that conqueror:


26:25.467 --> 26:30.439
“And I saw, and look! a white horse,
and the one seated on it had a bow;


26:30.438 --> 26:35.443
“and a crown was given him
[well we know it refers to Jesus],


26:35.443 --> 26:41.000
and he went out conquering
and to complete his conquest.”


26:42.283 --> 26:46.955
Well, Jesus now rules over the whole earth.


26:46.955 --> 26:49.958
When did he go out to conquer?


26:49.958 --> 26:52.893
In 1914 of our Common Era.


26:52.893 --> 26:55.630
And when will he complete his conquest?


26:55.630 --> 26:57.632
At Armageddon.


26:57.632 --> 27:00.902
Whom did Jesus already conquer?


27:00.902 --> 27:05.407
First, he conquered Satan and the demons,
throwing them out of heaven


27:05.407 --> 27:09.844
and restricting their movements
to the earth and its vicinity.


27:09.843 --> 27:14.781
This war is described
in Revelation chapter 12.


27:14.782 --> 27:19.620
But in 1914,
his conquest was not complete yet.


27:19.620 --> 27:22.890
At Armageddon, it will be.


27:22.890 --> 27:27.495
Satan will be thrown
into an abyss of inactivity,


27:27.495 --> 27:30.632
and at the end
of the foretold thousand years,


27:30.632 --> 27:33.702
he will be totally destroyed.


27:33.702 --> 27:36.437
What a conquest that will be!


27:36.437 --> 27:39.707
At Armageddon, also,
all human governments


27:39.707 --> 27:42.000
will likewise be conquered.


27:43.912 --> 27:49.684
Let’s read Revelation 17:14,


27:49.683 --> 27:52.000
where we find this prophecy.


27:59.127 --> 28:02.064
It says: 


28:02.063 --> 28:04.865
“These will battle with the Lamb,


28:04.865 --> 28:08.102
“but because he is Lord of lords


28:08.102 --> 28:12.140
“and King of kings,
the Lamb will conquer them.


28:12.140 --> 28:14.642
“Also, those with him who are called


28:14.642 --> 28:19.647
“and chosen and faithful
[anointed Christians]


28:19.647 --> 28:22.517
will do so.”


28:22.517 --> 28:25.754
How about spiritual conquests?


28:25.753 --> 28:30.525
In Revelation chapters 2 and 3,
seven times Jesus says


28:30.525 --> 28:35.330
with reference to the anointed:
“To the one who conquers.”


28:35.330 --> 28:39.900
One example is Revelation 3:21, it says:


28:39.900 --> 28:45.373
“To the one who conquers I will grant
to sit down with me on my throne,


28:45.373 --> 28:51.946
just as I conquered and sat down
with my Father on his throne.”


28:51.947 --> 28:56.284
How do the anointed conquer
even right now before Armageddon?


28:56.283 --> 28:59.886
They conquer
by remaining loyal to Jehovah.


28:59.887 --> 29:04.000
They conquer due to their faith,
due to their love for Jehovah and Jesus.


29:05.260 --> 29:11.933
They also conquer the evil
with the good in everyday life.


29:11.933 --> 29:16.703
What about the “great crowd”
mentioned in Revelation chapter 7?


29:16.703 --> 29:21.441
Talking about the situation on earth
under the Messianic Kingdom,


29:21.442 --> 29:24.579
Revelation 21:7 says:


29:24.578 --> 29:27.448
“To anyone thirsting


29:27.448 --> 29:31.218
“I will give from the spring
of water of life free.


29:31.218 --> 29:35.656
“Anyone conquering
will inherit these things,


29:35.657 --> 29:39.927
and I will be his God
and he will be my son.”


29:39.927 --> 29:43.465
The Revelation Climax book,


29:43.465 --> 29:47.668
therefore, says on page 304:


29:47.668 --> 29:52.000
“The great crowd . . . too must conquer.”


29:55.443 --> 29:58.846
Even children can be conquerors.


29:58.847 --> 30:01.817
When a child is shoved by a sibling,


30:01.817 --> 30:05.820
usually the child’s first reaction
is to shove back.


30:05.820 --> 30:09.157
Sadly, such behavior
is not limited to children.


30:09.157 --> 30:11.994
Many adults act similarly.


30:11.993 --> 30:15.663
When offended by someone,
they want to get even.


30:15.663 --> 30:20.100
Granted, most adults
will not give a literal shove,


30:20.100 --> 30:24.172
but many will push back
in more subtle ways.


30:24.172 --> 30:29.677
Whatever method is used,
the intent is the same—to retaliate.


30:29.677 --> 30:32.714
Although the urge
to get even is deep-seated,


30:32.713 --> 30:37.318
true Christians
resist giving in to that urge.


30:37.318 --> 30:39.320
Instead, they strive to follow


30:39.320 --> 30:44.292
the apostle Paul’s admonition
of Romans 12:17:


30:44.292 --> 30:49.000
“Return evil for evil to no one.”


30:50.432 --> 30:52.867
Paul explains in detail
how all of us


30:52.867 --> 30:56.972
can conquer in everyday life.


30:56.972 --> 31:01.575
He wrote in Romans 12:20, 21:


31:01.575 --> 31:04.545
“‘If your enemy is hungry, 
feed him;


31:04.545 --> 31:07.148
“‘if he is thirsty,
give him something to drink;


31:07.148 --> 31:11.318
“for by doing this
you will heap fiery coals on his head.’


31:11.318 --> 31:15.856
“Do not let yourself
be conquered by the evil,


31:15.857 --> 31:20.000
but keep conquering the evil
with the good.”


31:22.030 --> 31:24.032
Back to you children.


31:24.032 --> 31:26.902
How can you
conquer the evil with the good


31:26.902 --> 31:31.805
if a sibling or a classmate
says something or does something unkind?


31:31.805 --> 31:36.610
You conquer by not retaliating.


31:36.610 --> 31:40.415
A worldly nursery rhyme
puts it this way:


31:40.415 --> 31:43.985
“Tit for tat.
You kill my dog; I kill your cat.”


31:43.985 --> 31:46.000
Maybe some of you know that.


31:48.923 --> 31:52.293
But Jesus tells us to forgive.


31:52.293 --> 31:54.261
Do something good.


31:54.262 --> 31:57.132
Pray for the other child.


31:57.132 --> 31:59.700
Because another has made a mistake,


31:59.700 --> 32:03.203
it is no reason
for us to make one also, is it?


32:03.203 --> 32:07.608
Jehovah does not want
us to retaliate.


32:07.608 --> 32:09.943
In 1 Thessalonians 5:15,


32:09.943 --> 32:12.180
it says: “See that no one renders


32:12.180 --> 32:15.683
“injury for injury to anyone else,


32:15.683 --> 32:20.000
but always pursue what is good
toward one another and to all others.”


32:22.190 --> 32:24.325
Therefore, children, 


32:24.325 --> 32:28.763
are you willing
to conquer the evil with the good?


32:28.763 --> 32:33.000
We want to commend you
for your effort to do that.


32:34.835 --> 32:38.000
You are making Jehovah’s
heart glad this way.


32:40.240 --> 32:44.245
How can we all conquer spiritually?


32:44.245 --> 32:46.847
We do so by not retaliating.


32:46.847 --> 32:49.084
This is the way of love.


32:49.083 --> 32:52.386
Many came into the truth
because of a Christian mate


32:52.387 --> 32:55.990
doing good to an
unbelieving mate for decades,


32:55.990 --> 32:58.893
although having been treated terribly.


32:58.893 --> 33:02.996
In the domestic setting,
a wife who shows genuine kindness 


33:02.997 --> 33:05.867
to her husband
after he makes unpleasant comments


33:05.867 --> 33:10.070
about her beliefs or yells at her
may well diffuse


33:10.070 --> 33:13.240
a potentially explosive situation.


33:13.240 --> 33:18.913
Such sisters conquer evil with good.


33:18.913 --> 33:21.915
We want to commend all of you


33:21.915 --> 33:26.000
who are not giving up
on your unbelieving marriage mates.


33:29.757 --> 33:32.494
If you show understanding
and compassion


33:32.493 --> 33:34.695
to the person
who is treating you badly,


33:34.695 --> 33:37.132
you might make him or her
want to learn more about


33:37.132 --> 33:39.534
the Bible and more about Jehovah.


33:39.533 --> 33:42.270
No matter how he or she responds,


33:42.270 --> 33:46.807
your mild and kind actions and words


33:46.807 --> 33:50.512
make the person wonder why you are different.


33:50.512 --> 33:52.880
1 Peter 3:4 refers


33:52.880 --> 33:57.385
to “the incorruptible adornment


33:57.385 --> 34:02.000
of the quiet and mild spirit”


34:03.523 --> 34:08.000
—quiet and mild spirit.


34:09.263 --> 34:14.068
On one island, a Pentecostal woman
started to study the Bible.


34:14.068 --> 34:19.173
But her opposed husband did,
of course, not like it. 


34:19.173 --> 34:21.875
He even threatened the elders.


34:21.875 --> 34:25.112
But then he fell sick
and was taken to a hospital,


34:25.112 --> 34:27.549
where he fell into a coma.


34:27.548 --> 34:30.585
When he eventually regained consciousness,


34:30.585 --> 34:34.122
two sisters visited
and brought him some soup,


34:34.122 --> 34:36.957
which he first thought was for his wife.


34:36.957 --> 34:41.162
“No, the soup is for you!” said the sisters.


34:41.162 --> 34:45.434
“That touched me deeply,” he recalls.


34:45.433 --> 34:49.870
“No Pentecostal had visited me,
yet two of Jehovah’s Witnesses


34:49.870 --> 34:54.000
—the very people I had strongly opposed—
brought me a meal.”


34:55.275 --> 34:57.978
He recovered from his illness.


34:57.978 --> 35:00.113
He studied twice a week


35:00.113 --> 35:04.000
and was baptized in 1998.


35:05.385 --> 35:08.000
You want to hear another soup experience?


35:09.857 --> 35:13.929
Two brothers in Russia were preaching
from house to house one morning.


35:13.928 --> 35:17.398
A woman listened to their introduction
and then excused herself.


35:17.398 --> 35:22.035
She returned with a pot of borscht
—a red beet soup—


35:22.035 --> 35:24.672
and threw this on the brothers,


35:24.672 --> 35:29.910
adding angrily, “Do not visit me again!”


35:29.910 --> 35:32.713
The brothers returned home
to change their clothes


35:32.713 --> 35:34.881
and then continued their activity.


35:34.882 --> 35:37.485
Later that day,
they went to the market


35:37.485 --> 35:42.055
to order ingredients


35:42.055 --> 35:44.425
needed for a good borscht.


35:44.425 --> 35:48.528
That evening,
they visited the same woman again.


35:48.528 --> 35:53.433
They told her that this time they came,
not to preach, but to compensate her


35:53.433 --> 35:56.436
for the loss of her family’s food,


35:56.437 --> 35:59.140
knowing that the soup she had wasted


35:59.140 --> 36:02.000
might have been the entire family meal.


36:03.143 --> 36:06.813
Then they handed her the foodstuffs
that they had purchased.


36:06.813 --> 36:11.718
The woman was so surprised
that she invited the brothers in to talk.


36:11.718 --> 36:16.000
In time, a Bible study
was started with this woman.


36:18.158 --> 36:22.863
When non-Witnesses treat us badly,
it is to be expected.


36:22.863 --> 36:26.666
But when problems occur
with a spiritual brother or sister,


36:26.667 --> 36:29.504
the pain can be much deeper.


36:29.503 --> 36:33.573
One brother recalled, “My biggest hurdle
when coming into the truth


36:33.573 --> 36:38.111
was accepting the fact that
Jehovah’s people are not perfect.”


36:38.112 --> 36:40.447
Thus, if a fellow Christian,


36:40.447 --> 36:42.850
especially one 
with privileges in the congregation,


36:42.850 --> 36:46.187
is thoughtless
and acts in an unchristian way,


36:46.187 --> 36:48.255
it can hurt us.


36:48.255 --> 36:52.660
‘How can such things occur among
Jehovah’s people?’ some may ask.


36:52.660 --> 36:56.630
Actually, such things did occur
even among anointed Christians


36:56.630 --> 36:59.400
in the days of the apostles.


36:59.400 --> 37:03.370
How should we respond
when we are affected?


37:03.370 --> 37:07.375
We can forgive,
and we can pray for them.


37:07.375 --> 37:12.247
In this way,
we prove ourselves to be conquerors.


37:12.247 --> 37:15.182
Recall the experience of Joseph. 


37:15.182 --> 37:19.154
His brothers dealt cruelly with him, 
but he conquered the bad 


37:19.153 --> 37:23.890
they did to him with good, 
resulting in happiness for all 


37:23.890 --> 37:26.000
and certainly also for Jehovah.


37:27.862 --> 37:31.665
Brothers in Nazi times 
and in concentration camps 


37:31.665 --> 37:36.637
did not retaliate
when mistreated by SS officers.


37:36.637 --> 37:41.209
Because of that,
some of the SS officers came into the truth.


37:41.208 --> 37:46.046
Some officers in camps preferred to be shaved
by the brothers


37:46.047 --> 37:48.082
—only the brothers.


37:48.082 --> 37:52.219
They were nervous
if other prisoners would do it,


37:52.218 --> 37:54.921
fearing that one would, perhaps,


37:54.922 --> 37:58.000
retaliate and cut their throats in revenge.


38:01.128 --> 38:06.133
Twelve sisters were in the camp
of Birkenau only a few days,


38:06.133 --> 38:09.536
then they were taken
to another camp, Auschwitz,


38:09.537 --> 38:12.940
to work in the homes of SS officers.


38:12.940 --> 38:16.177
They wanted
only Jehovah’s Witnesses for that.


38:16.177 --> 38:19.647
These officers were afraid
of having others


38:19.647 --> 38:21.649
working in their households.


38:21.648 --> 38:26.000
They trusted that the sisters
would not try to poison them.


38:27.220 --> 38:32.125
In the 1960’s, I met Franz Desch,
from Jenbach, Austria.


38:32.125 --> 38:35.628
He was taken to the
Gusen concentration camp.


38:35.628 --> 38:40.166
There, he was able to study the Bible
with an SS officer.


38:40.167 --> 38:42.437
How much progress was made?


38:42.437 --> 38:46.674
Well, imagine the great joy
of both of them when,


38:46.673 --> 38:48.875
some years later,


38:48.875 --> 38:52.000
they met as brothers at a convention.


38:55.448 --> 38:59.886
Now, let’s talk about
conquering opposition today.


38:59.887 --> 39:04.459
The pressures of life in this wicked system
can make people feel angry.


39:04.458 --> 39:08.095
Although we are kind, peaceful,
and law-abiding,


39:08.095 --> 39:11.765
Jehovah’s enemies
launch vicious attacks against us


39:11.765 --> 39:15.135
—like some people in lands such as Russia.


39:15.135 --> 39:19.040
Some slander us in the press
or even in courts.


39:19.040 --> 39:22.377
Some governments have banned God’s people.


39:22.377 --> 39:27.982
Jesus said that his followers
ought to expect that.


39:27.982 --> 39:31.152
In the future,
as the great tribulation gets closer,


39:31.152 --> 39:34.255
we may have to face even more opposition.


39:34.255 --> 39:37.290
How should we react?


39:37.290 --> 39:40.227
Romans 12:17 says to never


39:40.227 --> 39:45.299
“return evil for evil” in word or deed.


39:45.298 --> 39:49.303
Regardless of what the Devil
and his agents bring upon us,


39:49.303 --> 39:53.840
by “conquering the evil with the good,”
we can give a fine witness.


39:53.840 --> 39:58.178
An important key is using gracious speech.


39:58.178 --> 40:00.480
Proverbs 25:15:


40:00.480 --> 40:05.000
“A mild tongue itself can break a bone.”


40:06.920 --> 40:10.290
Jesus is the best example of not retaliating.


40:10.290 --> 40:12.727
When the apostle Peter
cut off the ear of Malchus


40:12.727 --> 40:14.762
in the garden of Gethsemane,


40:14.762 --> 40:18.032
Jesus reproved him and healed Malchus.


40:18.032 --> 40:21.735
He did good to Malchus,
although he was a member


40:21.735 --> 40:25.000
of that mob that had come
to arrest Jesus.


40:26.640 --> 40:30.743
Well, Jesus was perfect; we are not.


40:30.743 --> 40:35.515
But we need to conquer also ourselves.


40:35.515 --> 40:38.918
We need to conquer wrong attitudes


40:38.918 --> 40:41.621
or bad habits that we might have.


40:41.622 --> 40:45.592
To conquer also means,
according to a dictionary,


40:45.592 --> 40:48.495
“to gain control of a problem


40:48.495 --> 40:51.765
or difficulty through great effort.”


40:51.765 --> 40:56.737
Many of us, when we came into the truth,
have conquered the smoking habit,


40:56.737 --> 41:02.544
overuse of alcohol,
or drug addiction with great effort.


41:02.543 --> 41:07.446
Then there is the bad habit
of viewing pornography.


41:07.447 --> 41:12.319
According to one estimate,
the number of pornographic e-mails


41:12.318 --> 41:14.388
that are sent daily


41:14.388 --> 41:19.193
amount to 2.5 billion,


41:19.193 --> 41:24.598
or 1.7 million per minute.


41:24.598 --> 41:27.300
Great effort is needed


41:27.300 --> 41:33.000
to conquer the addiction
of viewing pornography.


41:34.342 --> 41:37.645
After baptism,
there may be more things to conquer


41:37.645 --> 41:41.115
like overeating, a violent temper,


41:41.115 --> 41:43.783
the inclination to gossip


41:43.783 --> 41:48.000
—perhaps truthfully,
but negatively about others.


41:50.757 --> 41:55.129
It also includes conquering
an exaggerated fear of men.


41:55.128 --> 41:58.865
Faith in Jehovah will help you
to conquer such fears.


41:58.865 --> 42:03.437
Governments may try to
restrict freedom to worship God.


42:03.437 --> 42:07.240
We may even feel not sure
about our own lives.


42:07.240 --> 42:08.608
But remember: 


42:08.608 --> 42:13.146
The antidote to fear of man
is faith in Jehovah.


42:13.147 --> 42:15.649
1 John 5:5 asks:


42:15.648 --> 42:18.418
“Who can conquer the world?


42:18.418 --> 42:21.188
“Is it not the one who has faith


42:21.188 --> 42:24.225
that Jesus is the Son of God?”


42:24.225 --> 42:28.195
The previous verse, verse 4, says:


42:28.195 --> 42:30.297
“And this is the conquest


42:30.297 --> 42:32.399
“that has conquered the world,


42:32.398 --> 42:34.835
our faith.”


42:34.835 --> 42:39.340
In view of his matchless power,
Jehovah could force us


42:39.340 --> 42:43.943
to conquer every weakness
without having to struggle


42:43.943 --> 42:47.146
or to learn from our mistakes.


42:47.147 --> 42:49.417
But why does he not do so?


42:49.417 --> 42:54.220
Jehovah has given us
the precious gift of free will.


42:54.220 --> 42:58.225
By choosing to do God’s will
and by working hard to do so,


42:58.225 --> 43:01.162
we show the depth of our love for Jehovah


43:01.162 --> 43:04.000
and our desire to please him.


43:05.732 --> 43:09.404
We are conquerors even now.


43:09.403 --> 43:13.640
Jesus did not say he will conquer
at the end of the system of things.


43:13.640 --> 43:18.212
He said that he already
had conquered when he was on earth.


43:18.212 --> 43:20.780
John 16:33 says:


43:20.780 --> 43:23.450
“In the world
you will have tribulation,


43:23.450 --> 43:28.000
but take courage!
I have conquered the world.”


43:30.223 --> 43:32.425
In the verse before, Jesus said:


43:32.425 --> 43:36.763
“The Father is with me.”—John 16:32.


43:36.763 --> 43:39.533
So, yes, Jehovah helped him to conquer.


43:39.533 --> 43:41.901
Jesus did not have to fight alone,


43:41.902 --> 43:44.805
and neither do we have to fight alone.


43:44.805 --> 43:48.708
Jehovah and Jesus
are on our side to support us.


43:48.708 --> 43:53.013
Paul said: “Jehovah is my helper;
I will not be afraid.


43:53.013 --> 43:58.000
What can man do to me?”—Hebrews 13:6.


43:59.252 --> 44:03.424
Be determined to keep conquering the world.


44:03.423 --> 44:05.658
Winning one fight is not enough.


44:05.658 --> 44:08.228
We have to keep fighting.


44:08.228 --> 44:11.031
To conquer is a continuous action.


44:11.032 --> 44:13.900
We need endurance.


44:13.900 --> 44:17.403
Second Corinthians 4:16, Paul said:


44:17.403 --> 44:20.000
“We do not give up.”


44:21.008 --> 44:23.876
The Spanish, the Mongols, and the British


44:23.877 --> 44:26.847
did not conquer their territories


44:26.847 --> 44:30.017
in a day or a week or a month.


44:30.017 --> 44:33.287
Similarly, Romans 12:21 says:


44:33.287 --> 44:36.057
“Do not let yourself be conquered . . . ,


44:36.057 --> 44:40.527
but keep conquering the evil with the good”


44:40.527 --> 44:43.000
—continuous action.


44:44.665 --> 44:46.667
Here’s a true or false.


44:46.667 --> 44:50.870
Since we are much weaker than Jesus,
and since we are imperfect,


44:50.870 --> 44:54.307
we can conquer the evil,
we can conquer the world,


44:54.307 --> 44:57.000
but we cannot conquer Satan.


44:58.145 --> 45:02.817
False. First John 2:14 says:


45:02.817 --> 45:07.020
“I write you, young men,
because you are strong


45:07.020 --> 45:11.392
and the word of God remains in you
and,” listen,


45:11.392 --> 45:15.362
“you have conquered the wicked one.”


45:15.362 --> 45:19.600
Yes, they conquered Satan
back in the first century;


45:19.600 --> 45:22.002
we can do the same today.


45:22.002 --> 45:27.140
We will not be able
to conquer Satan out of his existence.


45:27.140 --> 45:30.243
Soon, though, Jehovah will
use Jesus and the anointed


45:30.243 --> 45:34.246
to throw Satan and the demons
into an abyss of inactivity.


45:34.247 --> 45:36.284
And at the end of the millennium,


45:36.283 --> 45:39.786
they will crush Satan’s head completely,


45:39.787 --> 45:43.000
according to Romans 16:20.


45:44.390 --> 45:49.000
Satan and the demons
are not conquerors of God’s people.


45:50.730 --> 45:53.000
They are losers.


45:55.868 --> 45:59.171
Jehovah will also direct Christ Jesus
to “crush and put an end”


45:59.172 --> 46:01.909
to all human political systems.


46:01.908 --> 46:06.000
They also will end up being losers.


46:08.582 --> 46:14.000
Now let’s read Romans 8:37-39,


46:17.457 --> 46:20.000
and this assures all faithful ones.


46:21.328 --> 46:24.000
It says:


46:26.200 --> 46:31.205
“In all these things
we are coming off completely victorious


46:31.205 --> 46:33.473
“through the one who loved us.


46:33.473 --> 46:37.276
“For I am convinced
that neither death nor life nor angels


46:37.277 --> 46:41.915
“nor governments nor things now here
nor things to come nor powers


46:41.915 --> 46:46.187
“nor height nor depth nor any other creation
will be able to separate us


46:46.187 --> 46:51.000
from God’s love
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”


46:52.392 --> 46:54.427
In review,


46:54.427 --> 46:59.399
be assured that
we can spiritually conquer the world


46:59.398 --> 47:03.803
by remaining loyal to Jehovah, to Jesus,
and to the Kingdom.


47:03.803 --> 47:06.906
We can spiritually conquer evil


47:06.907 --> 47:12.980
by our faith, by our love,
and by doing good.


47:12.980 --> 47:15.415
Second, we can also spiritually conquer


47:15.415 --> 47:19.953
our own bad habits or wrong attitudes.


47:19.953 --> 47:23.956
Third, we can spiritually conquer
Satan the Devil,


47:23.957 --> 47:26.000
and we can do it even now.


47:27.393 --> 47:29.495
Fourth, finally,


47:29.495 --> 47:33.933
Jesus and the anointed
will completely conquer Satan,


47:33.933 --> 47:37.871
the demons,
and all human governments


47:37.872 --> 47:41.140
in opposition
to Jehovah at Armageddon


47:41.140 --> 47:45.378
—the climax of the coming great tribulation.


47:45.378 --> 47:49.315
What strong encouragement
we have


47:49.315 --> 47:53.000
to continue to be conquerors!


48:00.793 --> 48:02.963
Thank you very much, Brother Lösch.


48:02.963 --> 48:06.165
We needed those words of encouragement


48:06.165 --> 48:08.335
to be world conquerors.


48:08.335 --> 48:12.038
We appreciate your help.


48:12.038 --> 48:17.343
Now pay close attention
to Brother Geoffrey Jackson.


48:17.343 --> 48:22.181
As expected,
he has an intriguing title for us:


48:22.182 --> 48:27.000
“Expect the Unexpected.”


48:31.525 --> 48:35.228
I’m sure every one of us
here today would agree


48:35.228 --> 48:38.298
that this year’s regional convention program


48:38.298 --> 48:41.000
was absolutely fantastic!


48:54.682 --> 48:58.019
And probably one of the
most common comments


48:58.018 --> 49:02.121
that have been made is that
many brothers and sisters have said,


49:02.122 --> 49:05.725
“This convention has truly prepared us


49:05.725 --> 49:07.860
for the great tribulation.”


49:07.860 --> 49:10.597
And we certainly feel that way.


49:10.597 --> 49:14.467
But as our minds think about
the great tribulation


49:14.467 --> 49:17.137
and the importance of Jesus’ words,


49:17.137 --> 49:20.040
it’s true, at times that our imagination,


49:20.040 --> 49:22.042
perhaps, becomes very active.


49:22.042 --> 49:24.645
We may have questions:


49:24.645 --> 49:28.515
How long will be the great tribulation?


49:28.515 --> 49:31.518
How will it affect me personally?


49:31.518 --> 49:35.455
Will I be able to get my medication?


49:35.455 --> 49:38.000
What about my cat?


49:40.293 --> 49:45.031
Well, the short answer
to all those intriguing questions is:


49:45.032 --> 49:48.969
We don’t know.


49:48.968 --> 49:52.171
But there is something that we do know


49:52.172 --> 49:54.574
beyond any doubt whatsoever.


49:54.573 --> 49:59.746
Let’s turn to the book 
of 2 Peter 2:9.


49:59.747 --> 50:03.784
And this fact fills us with confidence


50:03.783 --> 50:05.818
as we look to the future,


50:05.818 --> 50:08.488
to the outbreak
of the great tribulation.


50:08.488 --> 50:13.093
So, 2 Peter 2:9,


50:13.093 --> 50:15.195
there it tells us:


50:15.195 --> 50:17.663
“So, then, Jehovah knows


50:17.663 --> 50:22.000
how to rescue people
of godly devotion out of trial.”


50:23.337 --> 50:27.474
Yes, brothers and sisters,
we know Jehovah.


50:27.473 --> 50:29.508
We know his record.


50:29.508 --> 50:31.945
We’ve studied the Scriptures,


50:31.945 --> 50:36.215
and we totally believe
that no matter what happens


50:36.215 --> 50:39.887
—even though we don’t know
the details of what the future holds—


50:39.887 --> 50:44.590
we believe that Jehovah knows
how to rescue righteous persons.


50:44.590 --> 50:48.462
And we’ve seen time and time again


50:48.462 --> 50:52.532
how Jehovah does the unexpected.


50:52.532 --> 50:54.902
When we look through the Scriptures,


50:54.902 --> 50:59.774
that point is emphasized
over and over again.


50:59.773 --> 51:02.308
There are two scriptures that help


51:02.308 --> 51:05.545
to fortify this faith
and belief that we have.


51:05.545 --> 51:07.580
Let’s look at them together.


51:07.580 --> 51:10.717
The first one is found
in the book of Ephesians,


51:10.717 --> 51:15.000
Ephesians 3:20.


51:17.023 --> 51:20.193
Ephesians 3:20.


51:20.193 --> 51:24.030
Here the apostle Paul
under inspiration tells us:


51:24.030 --> 51:26.198
“Now to the one who can,


51:26.198 --> 51:29.501
“according to his power
that is operating in us,


51:29.502 --> 51:33.907
“do more than superabundantly beyond


51:33.907 --> 51:37.644
all the things we ask or conceive.”


51:37.643 --> 51:41.781
Now, this is a fantastic expression.


51:41.782 --> 51:44.684
In the Writing Department,
if we were to write this,


51:44.683 --> 51:47.486
I’m sure the proofreaders
would correct it.


51:47.487 --> 51:51.000
But this is under inspiration.


51:52.425 --> 51:56.095
For a start,
let’s think of the word “superabundantly.”


51:56.095 --> 52:00.933
Now, the proofreaders may tell us,
“For a start, ‘abundant’ is enough.”


52:00.933 --> 52:05.538
But here we have “superabundantly.”


52:05.538 --> 52:07.840
Now, it doesn’t stop there, does it?


52:07.840 --> 52:10.977
Because Paul then says under inspiration:


52:10.977 --> 52:14.849
“more than superabundantly,”


52:14.848 --> 52:16.883
and then it gets even better,


52:16.883 --> 52:21.020
“beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”


52:21.020 --> 52:24.925
This is certainly making the point, isn’t it?


52:24.925 --> 52:27.127
And what is the point?


52:27.127 --> 52:30.264
Jehovah can do things


52:30.263 --> 52:33.233
beyond what we would expect.


52:33.233 --> 52:36.703
It’s so interesting for us to note


52:36.703 --> 52:40.273
that Jehovah does not limit himself


52:40.273 --> 52:42.741
to what we ask for in our prayers.


52:42.742 --> 52:47.680
And we can be happy
of that because he goes beyond anything


52:47.680 --> 52:51.552
that we could ever think of
to solve our problems.


52:51.552 --> 52:56.389
So, it’s true, at times we may see
no way out of our problems.


52:56.388 --> 52:57.990
We may feel overwhelmed.


52:57.990 --> 53:00.327
But remember, what does it say here?


53:00.327 --> 53:04.797
Jehovah has the power
to “do more than superabundantly


53:04.797 --> 53:08.802
beyond all the things we ask
or conceive.”


53:08.802 --> 53:10.970
Now the second scripture


53:10.970 --> 53:15.000
is in the book of Philippians 4:6.


53:17.877 --> 53:19.880
Here again, we’re told:


53:19.880 --> 53:23.048
“Do not be anxious over anything,


53:23.048 --> 53:25.251
“but in everything by prayer


53:25.252 --> 53:27.987
“and supplication along with thanksgiving,


53:27.987 --> 53:31.224
“let your petitions be made known to God;


53:31.223 --> 53:34.826
and the peace of God that,”
now notice again,


53:34.827 --> 53:38.565
“surpasses all understanding


53:38.565 --> 53:40.967
“will guard your hearts


53:40.967 --> 53:45.105
and your mental powers
by means of Christ Jesus.”


53:45.105 --> 53:48.808
Have you noticed in several
of the talks today,


53:48.808 --> 53:51.778
the point is being made over and over again


53:51.778 --> 53:54.846
that this precious possession
that we have


53:54.847 --> 53:56.950
is our relationship with Jehovah?


53:56.950 --> 53:58.985
We need to trust him.


53:58.985 --> 54:02.622
Now, when the peace of God
comes to us because of praying


54:02.622 --> 54:05.959
to Jehovah and trusting him,
what does it say here?


54:05.958 --> 54:10.496
Then “that surpasses all understanding.”


54:10.497 --> 54:13.099
Other translations put it this way:


54:13.098 --> 54:16.101
“surpasses all our dreams,”


54:16.102 --> 54:18.939
“excels all human planning,”


54:18.938 --> 54:23.041
“is more wonderful than we can imagine.”


54:23.042 --> 54:25.445
Truly, brothers and sisters,


54:25.445 --> 54:29.548
we don’t need to know all the details
of what the future holds.


54:29.548 --> 54:32.318
We know that our loving God, Jehovah,


54:32.318 --> 54:35.655
will do things in a wonderful way.


54:35.655 --> 54:39.292
Yes, he does the unexpected,


54:39.292 --> 54:43.564
and he does it with style.


54:43.563 --> 54:46.265
That’s the amazing thing.


54:46.265 --> 54:50.570
As we read through the Scriptures,
we see this over and over again.


54:50.570 --> 54:52.905
Let’s think about Haman


54:52.905 --> 54:56.108
back in the days
of Esther and Mordecai.


54:56.108 --> 54:58.878
Haman had a lot of money,


54:58.878 --> 55:02.081
a lot of influence, and a plan.


55:02.082 --> 55:07.020
He wanted to commit genocide
to destroy all of God’s people,


55:07.020 --> 55:11.223
and it looked like the plan
was going to succeed.


55:11.223 --> 55:15.961
But Haman didn’t know
what Jehovah had in mind.


55:15.962 --> 55:19.399
Esther and Mordecai were in place.


55:19.398 --> 55:21.566
And how things turned out!


55:21.567 --> 55:23.604
The very day that the Jews


55:23.603 --> 55:26.940
should have been slaughtered
and completely eradicated


55:26.940 --> 55:30.943
was the day that their enemies
were killed instead.


55:30.943 --> 55:34.813
But as we read through those events,


55:34.813 --> 55:37.816
Jehovah did so many unexpected things.


55:37.817 --> 55:40.754
Personally, I just love chapter 6.


55:40.753 --> 55:43.523
Right in the middle of this intrigue 


55:43.523 --> 55:46.625
where we see what Jehovah is preparing,


55:46.625 --> 55:50.263
then there’s an account
about the king not being able to sleep.


55:50.263 --> 55:52.365
And, isn’t it wonderful?


55:52.365 --> 55:56.000
You see Haman
comes in at the wrong time for Haman.


55:57.670 --> 56:02.608
He assumes wrongly
that the king is going to bless him.


56:02.608 --> 56:04.643
And what’s the result?


56:04.643 --> 56:06.846
He has to be humiliated,


56:06.847 --> 56:10.117
walking around in front of Mordecai
on a horse


56:10.117 --> 56:13.420
wearing the king’s clothes!


56:13.420 --> 56:16.000
That’s style!


56:17.457 --> 56:19.725
Jehovah didn’t have to do that.


56:19.725 --> 56:21.862
But when we look back on it,


56:21.862 --> 56:25.265
that really is style, isn’t it?


56:25.265 --> 56:27.600
And we can be sure that Jehovah


56:27.600 --> 56:31.437
will continue to do these things
for his people.


56:31.437 --> 56:33.907
Recently, of course, we just watched


56:33.907 --> 56:37.644
that beautiful presentation
with regard to Hezekiah.


56:37.643 --> 56:41.781
Didn’t that full-length movie
help us to imagine


56:41.782 --> 56:43.984
exactly what happened at that time?


56:43.983 --> 56:47.720
But in the case of Hezekiah,
what did he do


56:47.720 --> 56:51.357
in the time leading up to that event?


56:51.357 --> 56:53.694
Well, he fortified the city,


56:53.693 --> 56:57.963
he stopped up the wells so the Assyrians
wouldn’t be able to get water,


56:57.963 --> 57:00.800
he did all sorts of things to plan.


57:00.800 --> 57:03.970
And yet, none of that was needed.


57:03.970 --> 57:05.305
Why?


57:05.305 --> 57:10.075
He didn’t realize what Jehovah
was going to do—the unexpected!


57:10.075 --> 57:15.782
We didn’t even expect it when we saw
that angel in the movie, did we?


57:15.782 --> 57:18.184
What a wonderful presentation it was!


57:18.183 --> 57:22.388
But, you see,
Jehovah again did the unexpected.


57:22.388 --> 57:26.258
None of his people
were thinking that Jehovah would do that.


57:26.258 --> 57:30.263
And yet, he had the situation
under control.


57:30.263 --> 57:32.698
And, of course,
time and time again


57:32.698 --> 57:35.935
as we look through the Scriptures,
we see this emphasized.


57:35.935 --> 57:39.105
Moses and the Israelites
—if we were standing with them


57:39.105 --> 57:43.477
there on the shores of the Dead Sea
with the Egyptians coming behind us,


57:43.477 --> 57:46.212
who of us would have ever guessed


57:46.212 --> 57:49.149
that Jehovah was now
going to part the Red Sea?


57:49.148 --> 57:51.583
I mean, that was unexpected!


57:51.583 --> 57:54.020
It was also unexpected that the Egyptians


57:54.020 --> 57:57.857
would be so stupid to follow the Israelites.


57:57.857 --> 58:01.560
And yet, it resulted in a wonderful victory


58:01.560 --> 58:03.630
for Jehovah’s people.


58:03.630 --> 58:06.833
You see, expect the unexpected


58:06.833 --> 58:09.535
when it comes to what Jehovah does.


58:09.535 --> 58:12.672
Now, thinking back to what the apostle Paul


58:12.672 --> 58:15.609
was inspired to say
to the brothers in Philippi,


58:15.608 --> 58:19.145
let’s think about the setting
of when he wrote that


58:19.145 --> 58:21.547
and a little bit of the background.


58:21.547 --> 58:26.052
The apostle Paul said, basically:
“Don’t worry.


58:26.052 --> 58:30.824
Pray because Jehovah
can do the unexpected.”


58:30.823 --> 58:33.626
Well, was Paul perhaps


58:33.627 --> 58:38.632
writing that particular time
as an academic sitting behind a desk


58:38.632 --> 58:43.369
—someone who is testing out
something he doesn’t really know about?


58:43.368 --> 58:45.405
Of course not!


58:45.405 --> 58:49.275
We remember back at that time,
in 60 to 61 C.E.,


58:49.275 --> 58:51.810
the apostle Paul was in prison in Rome.


58:51.810 --> 58:55.615
He’d already experienced many,
many different hardships.


58:55.615 --> 59:00.320
He knew what it was like
to be in a time of trial.


59:00.320 --> 59:02.822
But even the very fact that he was writing


59:02.822 --> 59:05.625
to the brothers in Philippi is of interest.


59:05.625 --> 59:08.795
Let’s just refresh
our memories about this.


59:08.795 --> 59:11.763
You’ll see the record in Acts 16.


59:11.763 --> 59:16.568
But what actually happened
ten years before


59:16.568 --> 59:20.138
Paul wrote the letter
to the brothers in Philippi?


59:20.138 --> 59:23.041
Well, Paul was in Asia Minor.


59:23.042 --> 59:26.112
He was trying to find somewhere


59:26.112 --> 59:28.815
where the holy spirit
would allow him to preach.


59:28.815 --> 59:31.183
So he went to one location—no.


59:31.183 --> 59:33.418
He went to another location—no.


59:33.418 --> 59:36.855
Eventually, he arrives at Troas,


59:36.855 --> 59:41.793
and there one evening,
he sees a Macedonian man.


59:41.793 --> 59:43.963
And what does he say?


59:43.963 --> 59:47.100
“Step over into Macedonia.”


59:47.100 --> 59:52.005
Well, Paul naturally assumed
this was Jehovah’s direction,


59:52.005 --> 59:56.608
and immediately he made plans
to step over into Macedonia.


59:56.608 --> 1:00:00.546
And this actually started
the preaching work in Europe.


1:00:00.547 --> 1:00:04.517
Well, he arrived first
at the seaport of Neapolis


1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:08.254
and then made his way to Philippi.


1:00:08.253 --> 1:00:11.056
Well, immediately
there was some success.


1:00:11.057 --> 1:00:14.394
Some started to accept the message.


1:00:14.393 --> 1:00:17.630
But what happened shortly thereafter?


1:00:17.630 --> 1:00:20.265
Well, as we already mentioned today,


1:00:20.265 --> 1:00:23.335
the account tells us that Paul and Silas


1:00:23.335 --> 1:00:27.840
were beaten up and thrown into a dungeon
—into a prison.


1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:32.345
Now, if you were Paul
and you were sitting there in prison


1:00:32.345 --> 1:00:37.150
with your back paining,
singing songs to bring yourself comfort,


1:00:37.150 --> 1:00:39.818
perhaps would you think this:


1:00:39.818 --> 1:00:43.455
‘What is Jehovah doing?


1:00:43.455 --> 1:00:45.825
‘I mean, I was in Asia Minor.


1:00:45.825 --> 1:00:48.427
‘I could’ve preached anywhere in Asia Minor.


1:00:48.427 --> 1:00:52.799
‘But, no, the vision said,
“Step over into Macedonia.”


1:00:52.798 --> 1:00:55.735
‘Now, I’m assuming there’s
a big door of activity open,


1:00:55.735 --> 1:00:59.238
‘but now here I am in prison.


1:00:59.238 --> 1:01:02.541
Why did Jehovah direct me to come here?’


1:01:02.542 --> 1:01:05.244
I’m sure—
I think most of us would probably


1:01:05.243 --> 1:01:08.346
start thinking along that line
and perhaps be discouraged.


1:01:08.347 --> 1:01:11.417
Perhaps, at times,
you’ve felt you followed


1:01:11.417 --> 1:01:14.354
Jehovah’s direction
and then you’ve had problems.


1:01:14.353 --> 1:01:18.123
So we’re used to understanding
that situation.


1:01:18.123 --> 1:01:21.093
But what happened that very night?


1:01:21.093 --> 1:01:25.030
An earthquake,
the doors of the prison open up,


1:01:25.030 --> 1:01:28.167
the jailer and his family accept the truth


1:01:28.167 --> 1:01:31.737
—and then this is where it proves again 
Jehovah has style—


1:01:31.737 --> 1:01:34.674
those magistrates apologize to Paul.


1:01:34.673 --> 1:01:37.676
Paul says: “No, you take us out.


1:01:37.677 --> 1:01:40.000
And you escort us out of the city.”


1:01:42.182 --> 1:01:45.919
Now, that’s style!


1:01:45.918 --> 1:01:48.420
And as we read, what do we notice?


1:01:48.420 --> 1:01:50.355
I imagine this in my mind.


1:01:50.355 --> 1:01:53.558
It says Paul said good-bye to Lydia.


1:01:53.558 --> 1:01:56.661
And I imagine, maybe I’m wrong,
but I’m imagining the magistrates


1:01:56.662 --> 1:02:00.634
standing outside Lydia’s home
waiting for Paul to say good-bye


1:02:00.633 --> 1:02:03.770
and then continuing to
escort them out of the city.


1:02:03.770 --> 1:02:08.140
Now, not only is that style
but it was practical


1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:13.112
because it appears that, perhaps,
Luke, the doctor, was left to stay there


1:02:13.112 --> 1:02:16.249
in Philippi
and establish the congregation.


1:02:16.248 --> 1:02:19.351
And, no doubt, those magistrates
would have thought twice


1:02:19.352 --> 1:02:22.855
before they did anything bad
to the Christians after that.


1:02:22.855 --> 1:02:25.257
But, what’s the point?


1:02:25.257 --> 1:02:30.162
At times, we may feel that there’s
no way out of our problems.


1:02:30.162 --> 1:02:32.832
But, surely, the lesson that we learn


1:02:32.832 --> 1:02:35.935
over and over and over again


1:02:35.935 --> 1:02:39.772
is that Jehovah
can turn things completely around.


1:02:39.772 --> 1:02:44.777
Yes, even though we may speculate and think:
‘What if? Maybe he’ll do this,’


1:02:44.777 --> 1:02:47.914
in the end, when we look back on events,


1:02:47.913 --> 1:02:50.415
we can’t help but be impressed


1:02:50.415 --> 1:02:52.685
with how Jehovah handles things.


1:02:52.685 --> 1:02:56.188
He has everything under control.


1:02:56.188 --> 1:02:59.058
So that brings us back
to the regional convention


1:02:59.058 --> 1:03:01.093
—the Sunday program.


1:03:01.093 --> 1:03:04.296
We all enjoyed that symposium of talks


1:03:04.297 --> 1:03:07.900
with the little videos
dealing with the great tribulation.


1:03:07.900 --> 1:03:10.368
Maybe for most of us,
it took us a while


1:03:10.368 --> 1:03:13.271
to work out
what they were doing in the basement.


1:03:13.272 --> 1:03:18.010
Usually, by the time there was a knock,
then we started to realize


1:03:18.010 --> 1:03:20.980
that it was at the time
of the great tribulation.


1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:25.083
And with excitement,
we watched as that door opened


1:03:25.083 --> 1:03:27.353
and there the police, the military,


1:03:27.353 --> 1:03:30.188
were facing our brothers and sisters.


1:03:30.188 --> 1:03:32.191
And you were waiting!


1:03:32.192 --> 1:03:35.795
Will the angel come and take them out?


1:03:35.795 --> 1:03:38.763
Will fire come from heaven?


1:03:38.763 --> 1:03:40.966
And we were left hanging.


1:03:40.967 --> 1:03:42.969
Why? 


1:03:42.968 --> 1:03:46.005
The simple answer: We don’t know. 


1:03:46.005 --> 1:03:48.573
But one thing is for sure.


1:03:48.573 --> 1:03:53.078
If Jehovah is on our side,
we do not need to fear men.


1:03:53.078 --> 1:03:55.080
Yes, it’s true.


1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:59.618
We don’t know all the details
of the great tribulation.


1:03:59.618 --> 1:04:02.921
We don’t know exactly what’s
going to happen in the future.


1:04:02.922 --> 1:04:06.625
But, we do know
that our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah God,


1:04:06.625 --> 1:04:09.128
has everything under control.


1:04:09.128 --> 1:04:11.130
Yes, he has style!


1:04:11.130 --> 1:04:15.000
So we can expect the unexpected!


1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:44.000
I used to give talks
like that when I was young.


1:05:02.282 --> 1:05:05.000
We have another blessing,


1:05:07.185 --> 1:05:11.223
and it’s to be presented by the tongue
of Brother Anthony Morris.


1:05:11.223 --> 1:05:17.330
Listen carefully as he develops
the theme “Run to Jehovah.”


1:05:17.330 --> 1:05:20.498
I have to say, I remember those talks.


1:05:20.498 --> 1:05:24.000
I miss them so much, Sam.


1:05:33.145 --> 1:05:35.180
Oh boy!


1:05:35.180 --> 1:05:37.215
Expect the unexpected!


1:05:37.215 --> 1:05:40.485
Thank you very much.


1:05:40.485 --> 1:05:43.922
Oh boy!


1:05:43.922 --> 1:05:46.000
Now I have to get very serious.


1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:00.005
Jehovah in his Holy Word
forewarned us to expect ridicule


1:06:00.005 --> 1:06:03.808
for our conviction
that he’s going to destroy


1:06:03.808 --> 1:06:06.645
Satan’s wicked system of things.


1:06:06.645 --> 1:06:10.515
Quoting Scripture: “Where is this
promised presence of his? . . .


1:06:10.515 --> 1:06:15.320
All things are continuing exactly
as they were from creation’s beginning.”


1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:20.558
In other words, everything is the same; 
nothing has really changed. 


1:06:20.558 --> 1:06:23.000
Are things really the same?


1:06:24.097 --> 1:06:27.065
Well, here in the United States,
among the many shootings


1:06:27.065 --> 1:06:31.870
—I’m thinking of the one not too long ago
down in Dallas, Texas—


1:06:31.870 --> 1:06:36.542
this man was shooting at police officers,
and they caught video of it. 


1:06:36.542 --> 1:06:38.877
And people didn’t know
what the shooting was about


1:06:38.877 --> 1:06:43.000
or who was the particular target,
so they started to run.


1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:46.919
They didn’t know where they were running,


1:06:46.918 --> 1:06:49.421
but they were just looking for safety


1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:52.725
—running, looking for safety.


1:06:52.725 --> 1:06:54.493
Panic was in their faces.


1:06:54.493 --> 1:06:57.261
You could see it on the video.


1:06:57.262 --> 1:07:01.567
Now, during these final days
of Satan’s rule,


1:07:01.567 --> 1:07:04.604
all over the world,
people are frightened.


1:07:04.603 --> 1:07:08.640
They don’t know
where to go to be safe.


1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:11.077
But we have something
to direct them to.


1:07:11.077 --> 1:07:14.647
Turn to Proverbs chapter 18,


1:07:14.647 --> 1:07:16.782
and this is where we have the theme


1:07:16.782 --> 1:07:21.187
for this final talk
here at our annual meeting.


1:07:21.187 --> 1:07:25.524
Proverbs 18:10:


1:07:25.523 --> 1:07:29.295
“The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.


1:07:29.295 --> 1:07:34.333
Into it the righteous one runs 
and receives protection.”


1:07:34.333 --> 1:07:38.270
Yes, as wickedness
advances from bad to worse,


1:07:38.270 --> 1:07:40.873
we have to run to Jehovah


1:07:40.873 --> 1:07:43.541
to be protected, to be safe.


1:07:43.542 --> 1:07:46.812
And once we’re in the tower
—to remain there—


1:07:46.812 --> 1:07:50.482
that means we look to Jehovah in faith,
in obedience,


1:07:50.482 --> 1:07:52.485
and we recognize


1:07:52.485 --> 1:07:57.088
how important it is
to faithfully represent that name.


1:07:57.088 --> 1:07:59.525
So the purpose of this talk


1:07:59.525 --> 1:08:02.928
is to encourage all of us to run to Jehovah.


1:08:02.928 --> 1:08:06.798
Those of us that have run to him,
don’t lose heart,


1:08:06.798 --> 1:08:09.601
and be busy teaching others


1:08:09.602 --> 1:08:12.772
that they better run 
to Jehovah before it’s too late.


1:08:12.772 --> 1:08:17.610
Now, the end is very close,
and it’s obvious.


1:08:17.610 --> 1:08:19.712
Why is it obvious?


1:08:19.712 --> 1:08:23.082
Well, we’re going to review
some fundamental truths


1:08:23.082 --> 1:08:25.517
that are so spiritually fortifying.


1:08:25.517 --> 1:08:28.754
And you really can’t
review them often enough.


1:08:28.753 --> 1:08:31.000
Matthew chapter 24,


1:08:32.323 --> 1:08:37.328
and we’re going to clearly emphasize


1:08:37.328 --> 1:08:40.065
why we know we’re close.


1:08:40.065 --> 1:08:42.233
Matthew 24.


1:08:42.233 --> 1:08:46.871
After Jesus here has mentioned
what’s going to happen to the temple


1:08:46.872 --> 1:08:50.042
and, of course,
he gets to the third verse here


1:08:50.042 --> 1:08:53.145
where the disciples
in private approach him,


1:08:53.145 --> 1:08:56.215
which were Peter, James, 
John, and Andrew.


1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:58.617
And they want to know:
“When will these things be,


1:08:58.617 --> 1:09:01.420
“and what will be the sign of your presence


1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:04.590
and of the conclusion
of the system of things?”


1:09:04.590 --> 1:09:06.725
So this presence is referring to


1:09:06.725 --> 1:09:11.697
Jesus’ enthronement as King
in his royal visit to this earth.


1:09:11.697 --> 1:09:16.202
Now, what stands out,
we have the increase of lawlessness


1:09:16.202 --> 1:09:20.539
—and you might keep in mind—
that’s not just criminal lawlessness,


1:09:20.538 --> 1:09:23.308
that’s disdain for Jehovah’s law.


1:09:23.308 --> 1:09:25.476
See, people forget that.


1:09:25.477 --> 1:09:28.780
And look at the disdain
for Jehovah’s law.


1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:31.983
Now, after he emphasizes in verse 36


1:09:31.983 --> 1:09:34.753
that no human is going to know
the day or the hour,


1:09:34.753 --> 1:09:38.856
notice what Jesus stated, verse 37:


1:09:38.857 --> 1:09:41.727
“For just as the days of Noah were,


1:09:41.727 --> 1:09:45.264
“so the presence
of the Son of man will be.


1:09:45.263 --> 1:09:48.966
“For as they were in those days
before the Flood,


1:09:48.967 --> 1:09:52.572
“eating and drinking, men marrying
and women being given in marriage,


1:09:52.572 --> 1:09:55.674
“until the day 
that Noah entered into the ark,


1:09:55.673 --> 1:10:00.411
“and they took no note
until the Flood came and swept them all away,


1:10:00.412 --> 1:10:05.284
so the presence
of the Son of man will be.”


1:10:05.283 --> 1:10:08.786
So there we have this clear comparison


1:10:08.787 --> 1:10:10.957
—it goes back to the days of Noah.


1:10:10.957 --> 1:10:13.225
They took no note,


1:10:13.225 --> 1:10:15.895
and we see the same today.


1:10:15.895 --> 1:10:18.463
While we rejoice with the thousands


1:10:18.463 --> 1:10:21.366
that are dedicating themselves
to Jehovah God


1:10:21.367 --> 1:10:25.304
and getting baptized each year,
the fact is, all over the earth,


1:10:25.303 --> 1:10:27.940
by far the majority take no note.


1:10:27.940 --> 1:10:31.610
They are busy about their daily affairs,


1:10:31.610 --> 1:10:33.778
and they’re not interested.


1:10:33.778 --> 1:10:36.515
They don’t want to run to Jehovah.


1:10:36.515 --> 1:10:41.520
It just doesn’t have any appeal
to make such changes.


1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:44.122
Now,
what sometimes seems


1:10:44.122 --> 1:10:48.727
to be forgotten
is found here in Genesis 6.


1:10:48.727 --> 1:10:52.497
Why did Jehovah take the action?


1:10:52.497 --> 1:10:54.367
Genesis chapter 6.


1:10:54.367 --> 1:10:58.204
Let’s remind ourselves of what really


1:10:58.203 --> 1:11:00.438
brought this to a head


1:11:00.438 --> 1:11:03.841
to where Jehovah took action.


1:11:03.842 --> 1:11:07.145
And it’s connected with our day


1:11:07.145 --> 1:11:09.548
because this is what’s motivating him


1:11:09.548 --> 1:11:12.751
to soon take action.


1:11:12.752 --> 1:11:16.000
Here we find Genesis 6:5:


1:11:17.522 --> 1:11:22.394
“Consequently, Jehovah saw
that man’s wickedness was great on the earth


1:11:22.393 --> 1:11:24.663
“and that every inclination


1:11:24.663 --> 1:11:28.166
of the thoughts of his heart
was only bad all the time.”


1:11:28.167 --> 1:11:33.139
Now, notice this
—it’s very significant—verse 11:


1:11:33.138 --> 1:11:36.475
“But the earth had become ruined
in the sight of the true God.”


1:11:36.475 --> 1:11:38.010
Why?


1:11:38.010 --> 1:11:42.347
“The earth was filled with violence.”


1:11:42.347 --> 1:11:44.684
Sound familiar?


1:11:44.683 --> 1:11:47.820
“The earth was filled with violence.”


1:11:47.820 --> 1:11:50.822
It stayed that way
for some time, and then, finally,


1:11:50.822 --> 1:11:54.560
Jehovah is fed up with the violence.


1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.062
And notice verse 13:


1:11:57.062 --> 1:11:59.565
“After that God said to Noah:


1:11:59.565 --> 1:12:03.202
“‘I have decided to put an end to all flesh,


1:12:03.202 --> 1:12:07.974
“‘because the earth is full of violence


1:12:07.973 --> 1:12:10.008
“‘on account of them,


1:12:10.008 --> 1:12:14.380
so I am bringing them
to ruin together with the earth.’”


1:12:14.380 --> 1:12:16.815
“Full of violence.”


1:12:16.815 --> 1:12:18.517
See?


1:12:18.517 --> 1:12:23.522
Same thing today
—this earth is full of violence.


1:12:23.522 --> 1:12:25.924
But that’s what moved Jehovah to act.


1:12:25.923 --> 1:12:30.328
And then the violence continued,
and finally, in chapter 7, verse 1:


1:12:30.328 --> 1:12:33.498
“Go into the ark.”
After years of constructing it,


1:12:33.498 --> 1:12:37.335
Jehovah had had enough of the violence.


1:12:37.335 --> 1:12:39.738
Now, this is pertinent.


1:12:39.738 --> 1:12:44.576
In 1987, the May 15 Watchtower,
page 20,


1:12:44.577 --> 1:12:46.945
paragraph 18,


1:12:46.945 --> 1:12:49.013
made this profound statement 


1:12:49.013 --> 1:12:52.416
related to the Flood 
and connecting it with our day:


1:12:52.417 --> 1:12:55.620
“Many of those who died
in the Flood no doubt


1:12:55.620 --> 1:12:58.923
“considered themselves ‘nice’ people,


1:12:58.923 --> 1:13:03.595
“not being involved in the violence
that filled society in those days.


1:13:03.595 --> 1:13:07.465
“But just being ‘nice’ did not save them.


1:13:07.465 --> 1:13:09.968
“By their apathy


1:13:09.968 --> 1:13:12.971
“they condoned the evil of their day.


1:13:12.972 --> 1:13:17.475
“The crucial thing
was that they did not ‘run’ to Jehovah;


1:13:17.475 --> 1:13:21.280
“they did not listen
when God’s servant spoke.


1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:24.550
“So they did not take
the proper steps 


1:13:24.550 --> 1:13:26.685
for survival.”


1:13:26.685 --> 1:13:29.855
And that’s where we are now.


1:13:29.855 --> 1:13:32.925
People must understand.


1:13:32.925 --> 1:13:34.927
We have to preach and teach them.


1:13:34.927 --> 1:13:39.364
They need to run to Jehovah
now before it’s too late.


1:13:39.363 --> 1:13:42.566
And during his presence,
all through these decades


1:13:42.567 --> 1:13:45.404
ruling in the midst of his enemies,


1:13:45.403 --> 1:13:48.806
you have to accept the fact
that the degree of violence


1:13:48.807 --> 1:13:52.812
at this point is mind-numbing.


1:13:52.812 --> 1:13:56.282
It’s just all over the earth—violence.


1:13:56.282 --> 1:14:01.287
And it isn’t just because of the media
and the Internet and such;


1:14:01.287 --> 1:14:04.422
it’s just filled with violence.


1:14:04.422 --> 1:14:07.425
So keep that in mind,
and we see that today.


1:14:07.425 --> 1:14:09.628
And something else Jesus connected


1:14:09.628 --> 1:14:13.898
when he was comparing his presence
with the days of Noah


1:14:13.898 --> 1:14:17.268
—note this here in Luke 17.


1:14:17.268 --> 1:14:21.873
And this is the second thing
that just makes it very obvious


1:14:21.873 --> 1:14:23.775
we are so close,


1:14:23.775 --> 1:14:28.000
and Jehovah is going to take action.


1:14:29.715 --> 1:14:31.750
And this is his judgment.


1:14:31.750 --> 1:14:34.553
Now, we would have people in general—


1:14:34.553 --> 1:14:36.555
Some countries would find 


1:14:36.555 --> 1:14:40.625
what we’re going to discuss here 
hate-mongering,


1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:44.497
but we will never water down
Jehovah’s Word, 


1:14:44.497 --> 1:14:45.997
sticking close with it.


1:14:45.997 --> 1:14:48.167
These are the words of Jesus Christ.


1:14:48.167 --> 1:14:53.000
If they want to take issue with him,
let them go ahead.


1:14:54.138 --> 1:14:58.643
Luke chapter 17, the Pharisees want
to know when the Kingdom is coming.


1:14:58.643 --> 1:15:01.946
Now, in verse 26 of Luke 17,


1:15:01.947 --> 1:15:04.817
he makes the connection
about the days of Noah,


1:15:04.817 --> 1:15:08.254
which we just addressed
and how he entered into the ark.


1:15:08.253 --> 1:15:11.356
Now, let’s read 28 through 30:


1:15:11.357 --> 1:15:15.760
“Likewise, just as it occurred
in the days of Lot:


1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:18.763
“they were eating, they were drinking,
they were buying, they were selling,


1:15:18.763 --> 1:15:21.200
“they were planting, they were building.


1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:24.468
“But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom,


1:15:24.468 --> 1:15:29.000
“it rained fire and sulfur from heaven
and destroyed them all.


1:15:30.142 --> 1:15:33.112
“It will be the same on that day


1:15:33.112 --> 1:15:35.614
when the Son of man is revealed.”


1:15:35.613 --> 1:15:38.000
Oh yeah.


1:15:39.383 --> 1:15:44.000
When Jesus is revealed
at the great tribulation, that’s it.


1:15:45.323 --> 1:15:49.995
Jehovah is fed up
with the sexual depravity as well.


1:15:49.995 --> 1:15:54.098
Now, two other Bible writers
connect these two events,


1:15:54.098 --> 1:15:56.735
and that’s why we see
how close we are.


1:15:56.735 --> 1:16:00.005
If you look at the world today,
it’s right before our eyes.


1:16:00.005 --> 1:16:02.040
Notice Jude, here.


1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:04.442
Let’s turn over to Jude.


1:16:04.442 --> 1:16:07.000
And he was inspired


1:16:09.513 --> 1:16:15.000
to encourage us, especially those
who’ve already run to Jehovah.


1:16:16.855 --> 1:16:19.000
Jude 6,


1:16:20.792 --> 1:16:25.000
and we’re going
to read 6 in the letter of Jude:


1:16:29.702 --> 1:16:33.072
“And the angels who did not
keep their original position


1:16:33.072 --> 1:16:36.609
“but forsook 
their own proper dwelling place,


1:16:36.608 --> 1:16:41.446
“he has reserved
with eternal bonds in dense darkness


1:16:41.447 --> 1:16:43.982
for the judgment of the great day.”


1:16:43.982 --> 1:16:46.419
So here we have it.


1:16:46.418 --> 1:16:50.521
This was a perversion
—unnatural—


1:16:50.522 --> 1:16:53.359
and he was addressing this.


1:16:53.358 --> 1:16:56.193
Jehovah inspired Jude to write this.


1:16:56.193 --> 1:17:01.198
These disobedient angels
materialized bodies, as we all know,


1:17:01.198 --> 1:17:05.103
and cohabited with women,
and they produced offspring


1:17:05.103 --> 1:17:07.371
—half-human, half-demon.


1:17:07.372 --> 1:17:10.542
A very difficult time for the earth,


1:17:10.542 --> 1:17:13.045
and Jehovah found that despicable.


1:17:13.045 --> 1:17:17.182
Now, this part of what happened prior


1:17:17.182 --> 1:17:19.284
to the Flood of Noah’s day


1:17:19.283 --> 1:17:23.588
is connected with verse 7,
this sexual depravity.


1:17:23.588 --> 1:17:25.890
Let’s read verse 7:


1:17:25.890 --> 1:17:28.927
“In the same manner,


1:17:28.927 --> 1:17:32.964
“Sodom and Gomorrah
and the cities around them


1:17:32.963 --> 1:17:35.966
“also gave themselves over


1:17:35.967 --> 1:17:39.337
“to gross sexual immorality


1:17:39.337 --> 1:17:42.940
“and pursued unnatural fleshly desires;


1:17:42.940 --> 1:17:46.945
“they are placed before us
as a warning example


1:17:46.945 --> 1:17:50.048
“by undergoing the judicial punishment


1:17:50.048 --> 1:17:53.251
of everlasting fire.”


1:17:53.252 --> 1:17:57.189
So Jehovah doesn’t mince any words here.


1:17:57.188 --> 1:17:59.691
This sexual depravity 


1:17:59.692 --> 1:18:02.194
found in the cities throughout this earth,


1:18:02.193 --> 1:18:04.696
he’s had enough of it.


1:18:04.697 --> 1:18:07.099
And you’d have to admit


1:18:07.098 --> 1:18:09.901
that just like
the Scriptures bring out


1:18:09.902 --> 1:18:14.572
in Genesis chapters 13 and 18,


1:18:14.572 --> 1:18:19.010
Jehovah said this “cry of complaint”
was going up.


1:18:19.010 --> 1:18:21.480
And all of the perverted ones


1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:25.550
—and not just Sodom and Gomorrah,
but the cities nearby—


1:18:25.550 --> 1:18:30.455
and this cry of complaint
was just too much


1:18:30.455 --> 1:18:32.957
for Jehovah to take,
and he took action.


1:18:32.957 --> 1:18:35.460
However, what about our day?


1:18:35.460 --> 1:18:38.797
Well, the sexual depravity—


1:18:38.797 --> 1:18:41.232
They don’t think they’re depraved,


1:18:41.232 --> 1:18:44.135
and our saying so


1:18:44.135 --> 1:18:48.640
is judgmental, offensive


1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:50.675
—at least to them.


1:18:50.675 --> 1:18:54.178
And we don’t intend to try
to deliberately offend people.


1:18:54.178 --> 1:18:57.615
We just—
This is what the Scriptures teach.


1:18:57.615 --> 1:19:00.418
It’s perverted,


1:19:00.418 --> 1:19:03.588
and we support Jehovah’s judgment on that.


1:19:03.588 --> 1:19:06.491
However, the spirit of Satan’s world is:


1:19:06.492 --> 1:19:09.327
“How foolish to believe that the story


1:19:09.327 --> 1:19:12.964
“of the Flood and the story
of Sodom and Gomorrah are true.


1:19:12.963 --> 1:19:15.000
You people are foolish!”


1:19:16.635 --> 1:19:20.972
Well, these stories are true.


1:19:20.972 --> 1:19:24.977
And Peter really makes it very clear here


1:19:24.977 --> 1:19:26.979
as he was inspired to write this,


1:19:26.978 --> 1:19:31.281
2 Peter and the second chapter.


1:19:31.282 --> 1:19:36.020
And so we love Jehovah


1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:38.523
for inspiring him to make this so clear


1:19:38.523 --> 1:19:41.460
because it helps us
to understand how close we are.


1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:46.465
And 2 Peter 2:4-6:


1:19:46.465 --> 1:19:49.067
“Certainly God did not refrain


1:19:49.067 --> 1:19:53.004
“from punishing the angels who sinned,
but threw them into Tartarus,


1:19:53.003 --> 1:19:57.041
“putting them in chains of dense darkness
to be reserved for judgment.


1:19:57.042 --> 1:20:00.645
“And he did not refrain 
from punishing an ancient world, 


1:20:00.645 --> 1:20:03.715
“but kept Noah,
a preacher of righteousness,


1:20:03.715 --> 1:20:07.018
“safe with seven others 
when he brought a flood 


1:20:07.018 --> 1:20:09.586
upon a world
of ungodly people.”


1:20:09.587 --> 1:20:12.557
Now, notice this profound point, verse 6:


1:20:12.557 --> 1:20:17.062
“And by reducing the cities
of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes,


1:20:17.062 --> 1:20:19.097
“he condemned them,


1:20:19.097 --> 1:20:21.600
“setting a pattern 


1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.568
for ungodly people
of things to come.”


1:20:24.568 --> 1:20:27.138
That’s the pattern


1:20:27.138 --> 1:20:29.706
for all these ungodly people.


1:20:29.707 --> 1:20:32.944
What Jehovah did in the Flood


1:20:32.943 --> 1:20:36.681
as well as in the day
of Sodom and Gomorrah


1:20:36.682 --> 1:20:39.750
and judged them there
—there’s the pattern.


1:20:39.750 --> 1:20:45.723
That’s their future if they choose
not to run to Jehovah.


1:20:45.723 --> 1:20:48.826
So considering this Scriptural evidence


1:20:48.827 --> 1:20:52.497
—the earth is filled with violence
and sexual depravity—


1:20:52.497 --> 1:20:57.235
it’s just so clear we’re
so close to the great tribulation.


1:20:57.235 --> 1:20:59.603
And contemplating what may occur


1:20:59.603 --> 1:21:03.441
—and it connects with Brother Jackson’s
comments about the great tribulation—


1:21:03.442 --> 1:21:06.510
we just need to ‘trust in Jehovah
with all our heart


1:21:06.510 --> 1:21:09.780
and not lean
on our own understanding.’


1:21:09.780 --> 1:21:14.785
And how reassuring to know
that very soon no one will worry


1:21:14.785 --> 1:21:18.188
about their safety
or the safety of their loved ones.


1:21:18.188 --> 1:21:21.593
The violence of the last days
will be done away with.


1:21:21.593 --> 1:21:25.796
All the sexually immoral people
who brazenly flaunt


1:21:25.797 --> 1:21:29.367
our precious Jehovah’s laws
will be destroyed,


1:21:29.367 --> 1:21:32.937
just as they were
in Sodom and Gomorrah.


1:21:32.937 --> 1:21:37.875
So rest assured,
Jehovah hears our cry of complaint.


1:21:37.875 --> 1:21:39.912
Do not lose heart.


1:21:39.912 --> 1:21:43.214
All you righteous worshippers
of the true God, remember:


1:21:43.213 --> 1:21:46.450
“The name of Jehovah
is a strong tower.


1:21:46.450 --> 1:21:52.000
Into it the righteous one runs
and receives protection.”


1:22:18.617 --> 1:22:20.885
Thank you very much, Brother Morris.


1:22:20.885 --> 1:22:25.323
That was a fine conclusion
to this wonderful program.


1:22:25.323 --> 1:22:29.026
We have received blessings galore


1:22:29.027 --> 1:22:31.664
in the form of things


1:22:31.663 --> 1:22:35.633
that ‘are true, serious concern,


1:22:35.633 --> 1:22:37.801
‘righteous, chaste,


1:22:37.802 --> 1:22:41.539
‘lovable, well-spoken-of,


1:22:41.538 --> 1:22:44.275
virtuous, praiseworthy,’


1:22:44.275 --> 1:22:48.045
“good and acceptable.”


1:22:48.045 --> 1:22:50.848
We already announced that depending


1:22:50.848 --> 1:22:54.851
on the direction you will be going


1:22:54.852 --> 1:22:56.922
when you leave the building,


1:22:56.922 --> 1:23:01.225
you can use the side doors
onto Pavonia Avenue


1:23:01.225 --> 1:23:06.000
or go through the main lobby
and exit through the front.


1:23:07.198 --> 1:23:10.000
Well, is there any other announcement
that I could make?


1:23:14.305 --> 1:23:17.000
Yes, there is.


1:23:18.075 --> 1:23:20.278
In fact,
the Governing Body requested


1:23:20.278 --> 1:23:23.681
that the following announcement
be made today.


1:23:23.682 --> 1:23:26.000
Are you ready?


1:23:27.285 --> 1:23:30.722
Well, let me set the stage
for the announcement.


1:23:30.722 --> 1:23:33.825
As you might have guessed,


1:23:33.825 --> 1:23:36.862
there have been many questions


1:23:36.862 --> 1:23:39.264
and some wild speculations


1:23:39.263 --> 1:23:42.633
about the upcoming dedication program


1:23:42.633 --> 1:23:46.536
for the Wallkill and Warwick
completed facilities.


1:23:46.537 --> 1:23:49.907
You’re about to get the definitive answer.


1:23:49.907 --> 1:23:53.712
Our announcement
reads this way:


1:23:53.712 --> 1:23:57.515
“The Governing Body is pleased
to inform you that the new facilities


1:23:57.515 --> 1:24:01.085
“at Wallkill and Warwick
will be dedicated in conjunction


1:24:01.085 --> 1:24:06.090
“with the annual meeting program
on October 7, 2017.


1:24:06.090 --> 1:24:10.062
“The annual meeting
and dedication program will originate


1:24:10.062 --> 1:24:14.532
“from world headquarters
in the auditorium at Warwick.


1:24:14.532 --> 1:24:19.537
“Hence, the number of attendees 
that will enjoy it live 


1:24:19.537 --> 1:24:22.974
“in the auditorium will be limited. 


1:24:22.973 --> 1:24:26.745
“However, the Governing Body
has approved that the program


1:24:26.745 --> 1:24:31.348
“will be streamed to
all Bethel facilities in the United States


1:24:31.348 --> 1:24:34.451
“and all Assembly Halls in the United States,


1:24:34.452 --> 1:24:37.989
“including here
at the Jersey City Assembly Hall.


1:24:37.988 --> 1:24:42.593
“In this way,
it is hoped that all who volunteered to work


1:24:42.593 --> 1:24:47.598
“on the Wallkill and Warwick projects
will be able to attend the annual meeting


1:24:47.598 --> 1:24:52.403
“and the dedication program
associated therewith.


1:24:52.403 --> 1:24:55.206
“However, the program will not be streamed


1:24:55.207 --> 1:24:59.510
“to other branch offices
or Assembly Halls in other lands.


1:24:59.510 --> 1:25:01.312
“The United States Branch Committee


1:25:01.312 --> 1:25:05.817
“will be providing more details
about the arrangements in due time.


1:25:05.817 --> 1:25:09.754
“Again, the dedication
of Wallkill and Warwick facilities


1:25:09.753 --> 1:25:12.623
“will be in connection
with the annual meeting


1:25:12.623 --> 1:25:16.460
“on October 7, 2017.


1:25:16.460 --> 1:25:20.000
Your brothers,
the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”


1:25:41.618 --> 1:25:44.721
That brings us to the conclusion
of our program,


1:25:44.722 --> 1:25:49.727
and I invite all of you to stand
and sing another of our new songs.


1:25:49.727 --> 1:25:54.599
We know it for the time being
as song number 136:


1:25:54.598 --> 1:25:57.968
“The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!”


1:25:57.968 --> 1:26:02.306
Please sing this majestic song
with full throat,


1:26:02.307 --> 1:28:49.892
just as it deserves, song number 136.

00:01 Brother Mark Sanderson has labored over his material
00:06 and is looking forward to presenting his talk.
00:09 It’s entitled “Your Labor Is Not in Vain.”
00:13 Brother Sanderson, you have our ears.
00:17 The date was September 8, 1922,
00:21 Cedar Point, Ohio.
00:23 Brother Rutherford, before that assembled crowd,
00:27 said those words that still ring in our ears.
00:29 He said: “Behold! The King reigns!
00:33 “You are his publicity agents.
00:36 “Therefore advertise, advertise, advertise
00:41 the King and his kingdom.”
00:44 Well, what a call to action that was by Brother Rutherford.
00:49 And in those few words,
00:51 Brother Rutherford showed
00:53 that he recognized something that is very important.
00:57 The faithful men and women that were in that audience
01:02 and so many others who have followed them since
01:06 were to be Jehovah’s publicity agents.
01:10 They were to be preachers and teachers
01:13 of the good news of God’s Kingdom.
01:16 Now, that’s a simple fact,
01:19 but it reveals something amazing
01:23 about our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
01:26 Although he is so almighty,
01:29 although just one angel
01:32 could kill 185,000 in one night,
01:36 we know Jehovah could use any miraculous means
01:40 in order to accomplish this preaching work.
01:44 But how has Jehovah chosen to accomplish it?
01:48 By using imperfect,
01:52 ordinary men and women like you and like me
01:57 in order to accomplish the greatest preaching work
02:00 that has ever been accomplished in history.
02:03 It reminds us of what the apostle Paul wrote here
02:07 in
1 Corinthians chapter 1.
02:09 Will you open your Bibles and read it with me?
02:16 First Corinthians 1:26, the apostle Paul said:
02:21 “For you see his calling of you, brothers,
02:24 “that there are not many wise in a fleshly way,
02:27 “not many powerful, not many of noble birth,
02:32 “but God chose the foolish things of the world
02:35 “to put the wise men to shame;
02:38 “and God chose the weak things of the world
02:41 “to put the strong things to shame;
02:43 “and God chose the insignificant things of the world
02:47 “and the things looked down on, the things that are not,
02:51 “to bring to nothing the things that are,
02:54 so that no one might boast in the sight of God.”
02:59 Well, perhaps those in Corinth
03:02 thought that being a new movement,
03:05 Jehovah would raise up people who were powerful
03:09 —people from important families or people who had great worldly wisdom—
03:15 but that was not the means that Jehovah was going to use.
03:19 He was going to use people who were described
03:22 as “unlettered and ordinary.”
03:25 Well, for what purpose?
03:28 Well, really, to magnify him and to magnify his almightiness.
03:33 He could use these imperfect people
03:36 to accomplish this tremendous work
03:39 and, really, so that no human
03:41 could ever boast in what was accomplished.
03:44 Well, when those words of Brother Rutherford went out
03:48 —that call to action— our brothers got busy.
03:51 Brother Melvin Sargent, who was baptized in 1912
03:55 and who was present there in Cedar Point to hear those words, said this:
04:00 “Those of us inside the Lord’s organization
04:03 “have tried, in every way possible,
04:06 “to turn their attention to the message of life.
04:09 “We have used slogans, full-page advertisements,
04:13 “radio, sound cars, portable phonographs,
04:17 “gigantic conventions,
04:19 “parades of information-walkers carrying signs,
04:23 and a growing army of house-to-house ministers.”
04:27 How true!
04:29 And perhaps some of you shared in some of those
04:31 different activities, and you used those tools.
04:35 Well, what about today?
04:37 Today, brothers, we have amazing tools to help us to accomplish the work,
04:42 things that we could never even have imagined:
04:45 jw.org, the JW Library app,
04:49 our Language app, JW Broadcasting,
04:54 as well as literature that’s now available
04:57 in literally hundreds and hundreds of languages.
05:01 But, brothers,
05:03 no matter how wonderful any of these tools are,
05:07 no matter how many tools
05:09 we ever produce, we cannot forget one simple point:
05:14 Tools need users.
05:18 And that means that every one of you
05:21 —every publisher of the good news of God’s Kingdom—
05:25 is absolutely essential
05:28 and is absolutely needed to accomplish this work.
05:32 Do you agree with me?
05:44 And we have to say that as a Governing Body, as we travel,
05:47 we see you preaching boldly from house to house.
05:51 We see your literature carts in airports,
05:54 on public corners, in train stations.
05:58 The work that you are accomplishing is amazing,
06:02 and you are to be commended for your hard work in preaching.
06:06 It’s much like the apostle Paul said here
06:08 in 1 Corinthians 15:58,
06:13 he said: “Therefore, my beloved brothers,
06:16 “be steadfast, immovable,
06:19 “always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,
06:23 “knowing that your labor is not in vain
06:27 in connection with the Lord.”
06:29 Well, that’s what you’re doing!
06:31 You see, you have  “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.”
06:35 But, let’s ask another question.
06:39 We know, of course, that our “labor is not in vain,”
06:44 but could we from time to time come to that wrong conclusion?
06:49 Could we begin to think
06:51 that our labor really is in vain?
06:55 Well, let’s consider three different areas
06:58 where we might wrongfully come to that conclusion.
07:01 Here’s the first.
07:04 With advancing age
07:07 or with increasing health challenges,
07:10 we may begin to think:
07:12 ‘Well, my voice is really very, very small.
07:16 ‘I really cannot contribute very much anymore
07:20 to the preaching of the good news.’
07:22 Well, if that’s the way you may have felt,
07:26 it might be encouraging to think about what we did today
07:29 —the release of our brand new songbook.
07:32 Now, isn’t it true?
07:34 We love to listen to our choral singing.
07:38 But now, when you listen to that choral singing,
07:41 what is it that makes it beautiful?
07:44 Is it the fact that  there are two or three loud,
07:48 booming voices that overpower everyone?
07:51 No, the beauty lies
07:54 in all of the voices coming together, harmonizing,
07:59 making beautiful music that praises Jehovah.
08:03 So, what can we learn from that?
08:06 Well, you see, whether our voice is loud
08:10 or whether our voice is very soft —or very small—
08:14 we all can contribute to this wonderful chorus
08:19 that’s being sung around this earth to praise Jehovah.
08:23 And, as Brother Splane so nicely mentioned in his talk,
08:27 the principle of 2 Corinthians 8:12
08:32 must be very powerful in our minds.
08:34 You see, there, the apostle Paul said:
08:37 “For if the readiness is there first,
08:41 “it is especially acceptable according to what a person has,
08:46 not according to what a person does not have.”
08:49 Well, now, we apply that to many different types of giving.
08:53 We apply it to our literal contributions of material things.
08:57 But we also can apply it to our use of our time,
09:01 our energy, our abilities
09:04 —everything that we give for the preaching of this good news.
09:08 So the question is not, What do you not have?
09:12 But the question is, What do you have?
09:15 Do you have a voice?
09:17 Well, whether it’s strong or soft, use it.
09:21 Continue to use it to praise Jehovah.
09:24 If you use sign language to communicate,
09:27 well, then, use your hands
09:30 to be able to tell others about the good news of God’s Kingdom.
09:33 Just recently, a brother sent me an experience of a Bible student
09:38 in India who is both deaf
09:41 and also was born with no arms.
09:45 Now, how can this man communicate?
09:48 Can you imagine?
09:49 He’s learned to do sign language with his feet,
09:53 and he is able to communicate and express his voice in that way.
09:57 Isn’t that wonderful?
09:59 We can use what we have to praise Jehovah.
10:04 And, I have to say, the Governing Body
10:07 deeply appreciates all of the hard work that you brothers
10:12 are doing whether your voice is loud and strong or quite weak.
10:16 We appreciate every one of you and the work that you’re doing
10:20 in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom.
10:25 But now let’s talk about a second area
10:28 where we might think that our labor is in vain.
10:31 This is when we say:
10:34 “Well, someone’s work is really far better than mine.
10:38 They can do so much more than I can.”
10:41 Well, it is a human tendency
10:44 for us to want to compare ourselves with others.
10:47 But, what is the counsel that we have from God’s Word in this regard?
10:51 Let’s read Galatians 6:4.
11:00 Galatians 6:4, it says:
11:04 “But let each one examine his own actions,
11:08 “and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard
11:12 “to himself alone,
11:14 and not in comparison with the other person.”
11:18 Yes, we have to look at what we can do
11:22 and what we can contribute to the work ourselves.
11:26 And in this regard, we have a beautiful example
11:29 that comes from our modern-day history that I’d like to share with you.
11:33 It’s the example of a brother named Adolf Weber.
11:38 Now, Brother Weber was baptized in Allegheny, Pennsylvania,
11:42 all the way back in the year 1890.
11:46 Now, that’s a long time ago, isn’t it?
11:48 Now, who was this man?
11:50 He was a Swiss woodcutter.
11:52 He had come to America,
11:54 and he worked with Brother Russell as a gardener.
11:58 He obtained a very deep knowledge of the Scriptures
12:01 from working with Brother Russell.
12:03 After a time, Brother Weber wanted with all his heart
12:08 to go back to Europe and begin preaching
12:10 in the French-language territories.
12:13 But, now, who was he?
12:15 Well, the yearbook— I’ll quote it.
12:18 I won’t try to make any judgments because I didn’t know Brother Weber.
12:21 But here’s what it said, ‘Brother Weber was
12:24 a simple man of peasantlike appearance.’
12:29 Well, if you see his picture in the Proclaimers book,
12:31 you might agree with that.
12:33 But, at the same time, the yearbook said:
12:37 “He was a devout, mature Christian
12:40 who knew well the English, French, and German languages.”
12:44 In fact, he translated the Studies in the Scriptures
12:48 and other early publications into French.
12:51 Well, as soon as he got back to Switzerland,
12:54 Brother Weber got busy.
12:56 He placed advertisements
12:58 in French-language religious newspapers and magazines
13:02 for Volume 1 of the Studies in the Scriptures and other books of Brother Russell.
13:07 Well, as a result,
13:09 people began to order Brother Russell’s publications.
13:12 They began to subscribe to The Watchtower in French.
13:16 Brother Weber went on big preaching campaigns.
13:19 He would go through Switzerland placing tracts.
13:22 He would go to France and Belgium, and he would meet with people
13:26 who had ordered literature or who had subscribed to The Watchtower,
13:30 all the while supporting himself
13:33 by doing woodcutting or gardening.
13:37 But now, were all of these efforts blessed by Jehovah?
13:42 Yes, because throughout that territory
13:45 —in Switzerland, in France, in Belgium—
13:47 many began to associate and began to serve Jehovah.
13:52 But then what happened?
13:55 In 1912, Brother Russell was on a trip through Europe,
14:00 and he decided to arrange to open a French-language office
14:04 in Geneva, Switzerland.
14:06 And so when Brother Russell looked at the candidates available,
14:10 he felt that there were other brothers
14:13 who were better educated who should now take over the work.
14:18 Well, now, how would that affect Brother Weber?
14:21 Here this humble man who had worked so hard
14:24 to get everything established was now being asked, as it were,
14:28 to turn over the reins.
14:30 Well, Brother Weber didn’t hesitate a bit.
14:33 The yearbook said he gladly stepped down
14:36 in favor of the more educated brothers.
14:40 Well, was he discouraged? Did he give up?
14:43 Did he try to compare himself with those other men?
14:46 No, the yearbook went on to say that he kept a good spirit.
14:49 He continued making his pilgrim visits to the congregations
14:53 and visiting the isolated brothers who spoke French.
14:57 But what happened?
14:59 Do you know the end of the story?
15:02 Well, just after a few years,
15:04 those well-educated brothers who had been placed in charge of the work—
15:09 Do you know what happened to them?
15:11 They all proved to be unfaithful.
15:14 And what happened?
15:16 Well, where’s Brother Weber?
15:18 We have to go and find this dear, humble man and bring him back.
15:23 He had to go and strengthen the brothers,
15:26 encourage them, readjust them, which he gladly did.
15:31 Despite the many challenges that this brother experienced,
15:35 he continued to strengthen and fortify the brothers
15:39 until he finished his earthly course
15:41 sometime about the year 1947.
15:44 What’s the lesson that we can learn?
15:47 See, Brother Weber
15:49 demonstrated the truth of Galatians 6:4.
15:53 He proved what his own work was.
15:57 He was content to be a lesser one
15:59 and to use his abilities and his spirituality
16:03 to be a source of encouragement to others.
16:05 He did not spend all of his time
16:08 comparing himself with others, but he brought what he had
16:12 and he used it to honor Jehovah.
16:15 Well, his labor was not in vain.
16:17 Do you know in the area where he opened up the work so long ago,
16:21 there are well over
100,000 publishers
16:26 who are praising Jehovah’s name?
16:28 What a powerful lesson we can learn
16:31 from this simple, humble brother, Adolf Weber.
16:35 But, now, let’s talk about our final area
16:39 where we might begin to think that our labor is in vain.
16:44 Perhaps some of you here have been serving
16:48 at Bethel for decades —many, many years—
16:51 and now you have been reassigned to the field.
16:54 Others of you may be circuit overseers
16:58 who have reached the age of 70,
17:00 and now you’ve begun to serve as regular or as special pioneers.
17:05 Well, now, should any of you in that situation
17:08 feel that your labors have been in vain?
17:12 Absolutely not!
17:15 Quite frankly, brothers, if possible,
17:18 all of us at Bethel should return to the field, if it were possible.
17:23 Because what did Jesus say at Matthew 9:37?
17:28 “Yes, the harvest is great,
17:32 “but the workers are few.
17:34 “Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest
17:37 to send out workers into his harvest.”
17:41 Yes, the workers are needed out in the field.
17:45 And these dear brothers and sisters who have returned to the field
17:49 who are now in the pioneer service,
17:52 they are accomplishing tremendous work.
17:55 Just as the Gilead School now has been designed
17:59 to train special full-time servants
18:01 to strengthen and stabilize,
18:05 well, now these ones who have returned to the field are having a powerful
18:10 and strengthening effect on the congregations.
18:12 They’re sharing their experience, their maturity,
18:16 the many wonderful lessons that they learned
18:19 from all of those years either in Bethel service or in traveling work.
18:24 Now, you know the Governing Body receives many letters from the field
18:28 —many letters of appreciation.
18:30 But I’d like to just quote from one that we recently received.
18:34 A sister wrote to the Governing Body and she said this:
18:37 “I want to thank you for sending into the field
18:42 “those who have served in special full-time service.
18:45 “While I cannot imagine how hard the decision must have been,
18:49 “I know I have benefited  beyond words
18:53 “from having such dear ones  in my congregation.
18:57 “They are truly a treasure from Jehovah.
19:01 “What a blessing to all those
19:03 “that have such ones in their congregation!
19:06 I thank you so much!”
19:09 Well, now, that’s just one letter.
19:11 But those words have been echoed
19:13 by publishers in this country and all around the world
19:17 who have received these well-qualified individuals
19:21 coming to their congregations.
19:23 So, dear brothers and sisters,
19:25 we’d like to say to all those of you who have been reassigned
19:30 how much we love you, how much we respect you,
19:34 how much we appreciate your work.
19:37 “Your labor is not in vain”!
19:59 Well, it truly is thrilling to be a part of Jehovah’s organization at this time.
20:04 From those small beginnings back in 1922 until today,
20:09 it’s amazing to see what has been accomplished
20:12 —now more than 8 million publishers  of the good news.
20:17 Our magnificent  and our wonderful God, Jehovah,
20:21 has chosen to accomplish this tremendous preaching work
20:25 using ordinary, imperfect people.
20:29 And we have been given the tremendous privilege
20:32 to be his fellow workers.
20:34 Brothers, are you determined to continue to preach along with us
20:39 until we say that this work  is finally completed?
21:07 Then may all of us have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord”
21:11 with full confidence
21:14 that our labor will never be in vain.
21:29 We certainly want to thank Mark for that fine talk,
21:33 and it’s encouraging to know that our labor will never be in vain.
21:39 So Jehovah remembers us for the effort that we put forth
21:43 in our service, and he remembers us for good.
21:49 Next, we have Brother Gerrit Lösch with a rousing subject for us.
21:54 The theme is “Be a Conqueror.”
22:00 The English word “conqueror” refers to one that conquers.
22:04 To conquer means “to defeat someone or something.”
22:09 The Spanish explorers and warriors
22:12 who successfully conquered much of America in the 16th century
22:17 are called conquistadores, or conquerors.
22:22 One of them was Hernán Cortés, who conquered the Aztec Empire.
22:28 At the peak, the Spanish Empire
22:30 ruled over 19.4 million
22:33 square kilometers,
22:36 or 7.5 million square miles.
22:42 But who conquered more land than the Spanish?
22:46 The Mongols and the British.
22:50 At its greatest extent, the British Empire was known
22:54 as the largest empire in history,
22:57 as it covered more than
13,000,000 square miles,
23:01 or 33.7 million square kilometers,
23:05 which is approximately a quarter
23:07 of the earth’s total land area.
23:11 Despite its overseas holdings,
23:14 it was barely bigger than the Mongol Empire under Kublai Khan.
23:20 The British Empire was bigger
23:22 only because of its overseas landholdings.
23:26 The Mongols were a nomadic people
23:30 who originated from the grassland plateau of what is today Mongolia,
23:34 in central and northeast Asia.
23:37 Their speedy conquests,
23:39 beginning in the early 13th century of our Common Era,
23:43 changed the face of Asia and half of Europe.
23:46 In just 25 years,
23:49 the Mongols subjugated the inhabitants
23:52 of more territories than the Romans
23:56 had conquered in four centuries.
24:00 At the peak of their power, they ruled from Vietnam to Hungary
24:04 (a distance of about 5,500 miles,
24:08 or 8,700 kilometers)
24:11 and from Siberia to India
24:15 —the largest contiguous land empire
24:19 in recorded history, including modern times.
24:25 Then there was Hitler who saw himself as a world conqueror.
24:30 He promoted the slogan
24:32 “Today, Germany belongs to us;
24:35 tomorrow, the whole world.”
24:39 His attempt to conquer the world failed miserably.
24:45 How about conquests in Bible times?
24:49 After the Exodus of the Israelites
24:52 from Egypt in 1513 before our Common Era,
24:55 Jehovah told the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan.
25:00 They were afraid and disobeyed.
25:03 Besides Moses, only Joshua and Caleb were willing to fight.
25:07 Numbers 13:30 says:
25:10 “Then Caleb tried to calm the people
25:12 “as they stood before Moses by saying:
25:14 “‘Let us go up immediately,  and we are sure to take possession of it,
25:18 because we can surely conquer it.’”
25:23 For their lack of faith,
25:25 the Israelites had to wander for 40 years in the wilderness.
25:29 After that, they conquered Canaan during a period of about five years.
25:35 In King Jehoshaphat’s day, Jehovah caused a victory
25:39 over the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites
25:42 from Seir—an alliance of nations.
25:45 Israel did not conquer in their own strength,
25:49 but Jehovah gave them the victory
25:52 by confusing the enemy alliance so that they killed each other,
25:56 according to 2 Chronicles 20:1-4.
26:03 What about conquests in the time of the end?
26:06 Do you know a world conqueror that conquered a larger area
26:10 than the Mongol and the British Empires?
26:15 Well, Revelation 6:2 gives the answer.
26:19 We can read about that conqueror:
26:25 “And I saw, and look! a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow;
26:30 “and a crown was given him [well we know it refers to Jesus],
26:35 and he went out conquering and to complete his conquest.”
26:42 Well, Jesus now rules over the whole earth.
26:46 When did he go out to conquer?
26:49 In 1914 of our Common Era.
26:52 And when will he complete his conquest?
26:55 At Armageddon.
26:57 Whom did Jesus already conquer?
27:00 First, he conquered Satan and the demons, throwing them out of heaven
27:05 and restricting their movements to the earth and its vicinity.
27:09 This war is described in Revelation chapter 12.
27:14 But in 1914, his conquest was not complete yet.
27:19 At Armageddon, it will be.
27:22 Satan will be thrown into an abyss of inactivity,
27:27 and at the end of the foretold thousand years,
27:30 he will be totally destroyed.
27:33 What a conquest that will be!
27:36 At Armageddon, also, all human governments
27:39 will likewise be conquered.
27:43 Let’s read Revelation 17:14,
27:49 where we find this prophecy.
27:59 It says:
28:02 “These will battle with the Lamb,
28:04 “but because he is Lord of lords
28:08 “and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them.
28:12 “Also, those with him who are called
28:14 “and chosen and faithful [anointed Christians]
28:19 will do so.”
28:22 How about spiritual conquests?
28:25 In Revelation chapters 2 and 3, seven times Jesus says
28:30 with reference to the anointed: “To the one who conquers.”
28:35 One example is Revelation 3:21, it says:
28:39 “To the one who conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne,
28:45 just as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.”
28:51 How do the anointed conquer even right now before Armageddon?
28:56 They conquer by remaining loyal to Jehovah.
28:59 They conquer due to their faith, due to their love for Jehovah and Jesus.
29:05 They also conquer the evil with the good in everyday life.
29:11 What about the “great crowd” mentioned in Revelation chapter 7?
29:16 Talking about the situation on earth under the Messianic Kingdom,
29:21 Revelation 21:7 says:
29:24 “To anyone thirsting
29:27 “I will give from the spring of water of life free.
29:31 “Anyone conquering will inherit these things,
29:35 and I will be his God and he will be my son.”
29:39 The Revelation Climax book,
29:43 therefore, says on page 304:
29:47 “The great crowd . . . too must conquer.”
29:55 Even children can be conquerors.
29:58 When a child is shoved by a sibling,
30:01 usually the child’s first reaction is to shove back.
30:05 Sadly, such behavior is not limited to children.
30:09 Many adults act similarly.
30:11 When offended by someone, they want to get even.
30:15 Granted, most adults will not give a literal shove,
30:20 but many will push back in more subtle ways.
30:24 Whatever method is used, the intent is the same—to retaliate.
30:29 Although the urge to get even is deep-seated,
30:32 true Christians resist giving in to that urge.
30:37 Instead, they strive to follow
30:39 the apostle Paul’s admonition of Romans 12:17:
30:44 “Return evil for evil to no one.”
30:50 Paul explains in detail how all of us
30:52 can conquer in everyday life.
30:56 He wrote in Romans 12:20, 21:
31:01 “‘If your enemy is hungry,  feed him;
31:04 “‘if he is thirsty, give him something to drink;
31:07 “for by doing this you will heap fiery coals on his head.’
31:11 “Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,
31:15 but keep conquering the evil with the good.”
31:22 Back to you children.
31:24 How can you conquer the evil with the good
31:26 if a sibling or a classmate says something or does something unkind?
31:31 You conquer by not retaliating.
31:36 A worldly nursery rhyme puts it this way:
31:40 “Tit for tat. You kill my dog; I kill your cat.”
31:43 Maybe some of you know that.
31:48 But Jesus tells us to forgive.
31:52 Do something good.
31:54 Pray for the other child.
31:57 Because another has made a mistake,
31:59 it is no reason for us to make one also, is it?
32:03 Jehovah does not want us to retaliate.
32:07 In 1 Thessalonians 5:15,
32:09 it says: “See that no one renders
32:12 “injury for injury to anyone else,
32:15 but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.”
32:22 Therefore, children,
32:24 are you willing to conquer the evil with the good?
32:28 We want to commend you for your effort to do that.
32:34 You are making Jehovah’s heart glad this way.
32:40 How can we all conquer spiritually?
32:44 We do so by not retaliating.
32:46 This is the way of love.
32:49 Many came into the truth because of a Christian mate
32:52 doing good to an unbelieving mate for decades,
32:55 although having been treated terribly.
32:58 In the domestic setting, a wife who shows genuine kindness
33:02 to her husband after he makes unpleasant comments
33:05 about her beliefs or yells at her may well diffuse
33:10 a potentially explosive situation.
33:13 Such sisters conquer evil with good.
33:18 We want to commend all of you
33:21 who are not giving up on your unbelieving marriage mates.
33:29 If you show understanding and compassion
33:32 to the person who is treating you badly,
33:34 you might make him or her want to learn more about
33:37 the Bible and more about Jehovah.
33:39 No matter how he or she responds,
33:42 your mild and kind actions and words
33:46 make the person wonder why you are different.
33:50 1 Peter 3:4 refers
33:52 to “the incorruptible adornment
33:57 of the quiet and mild spirit”
34:03 —quiet and mild spirit.
34:09 On one island, a Pentecostal woman started to study the Bible.
34:14 But her opposed husband did, of course, not like it.
34:19 He even threatened the elders.
34:21 But then he fell sick and was taken to a hospital,
34:25 where he fell into a coma.
34:27 When he eventually regained consciousness,
34:30 two sisters visited and brought him some soup,
34:34 which he first thought was for his wife.
34:36 “No, the soup is for you!” said the sisters.
34:41 “That touched me deeply,” he recalls.
34:45 “No Pentecostal had visited me, yet two of Jehovah’s Witnesses
34:49 —the very people I had strongly opposed— brought me a meal.”
34:55 He recovered from his illness.
34:57 He studied twice a week
35:00 and was baptized in 1998.
35:05 You want to hear another soup experience?
35:09 Two brothers in Russia were preaching from house to house one morning.
35:13 A woman listened to their introduction and then excused herself.
35:17 She returned with a pot of borscht —a red beet soup—
35:22 and threw this on the brothers,
35:24 adding angrily, “Do not visit me again!”
35:29 The brothers returned home to change their clothes
35:32 and then continued their activity.
35:34 Later that day, they went to the market
35:37 to order ingredients
35:42 needed for a good borscht.
35:44 That evening, they visited the same woman again.
35:48 They told her that this time they came, not to preach, but to compensate her
35:53 for the loss of her family’s food,
35:56 knowing that the soup she had wasted
35:59 might have been the entire family meal.
36:03 Then they handed her the foodstuffs that they had purchased.
36:06 The woman was so surprised that she invited the brothers in to talk.
36:11 In time, a Bible study was started with this woman.
36:18 When non-Witnesses treat us badly, it is to be expected.
36:22 But when problems occur with a spiritual brother or sister,
36:26 the pain can be much deeper.
36:29 One brother recalled, “My biggest hurdle when coming into the truth
36:33 was accepting the fact that Jehovah’s people are not perfect.”
36:38 Thus, if a fellow Christian,
36:40 especially one  with privileges in the congregation,
36:42 is thoughtless and acts in an unchristian way,
36:46 it can hurt us.
36:48 ‘How can such things occur among Jehovah’s people?’ some may ask.
36:52 Actually, such things did occur even among anointed Christians
36:56 in the days of the apostles.
36:59 How should we respond when we are affected?
37:03 We can forgive, and we can pray for them.
37:07 In this way, we prove ourselves to be conquerors.
37:12 Recall the experience of Joseph.
37:15 His brothers dealt cruelly with him,  but he conquered the bad
37:19 they did to him with good,  resulting in happiness for all
37:23 and certainly also for Jehovah.
37:27 Brothers in Nazi times  and in concentration camps
37:31 did not retaliate when mistreated by SS officers.
37:36 Because of that, some of the SS officers came into the truth.
37:41 Some officers in camps preferred to be shaved by the brothers
37:46 —only the brothers.
37:48 They were nervous if other prisoners would do it,
37:52 fearing that one would, perhaps,
37:54 retaliate and cut their throats in revenge.
38:01 Twelve sisters were in the camp of Birkenau only a few days,
38:06 then they were taken to another camp, Auschwitz,
38:09 to work in the homes of SS officers.
38:12 They wanted only Jehovah’s Witnesses for that.
38:16 These officers were afraid of having others
38:19 working in their households.
38:21 They trusted that the sisters would not try to poison them.
38:27 In the 1960’s, I met Franz Desch, from Jenbach, Austria.
38:32 He was taken to the Gusen concentration camp.
38:35 There, he was able to study the Bible with an SS officer.
38:40 How much progress was made?
38:42 Well, imagine the great joy of both of them when,
38:46 some years later,
38:48 they met as brothers at a convention.
38:55 Now, let’s talk about conquering opposition today.
38:59 The pressures of life in this wicked system can make people feel angry.
39:04 Although we are kind, peaceful, and law-abiding,
39:08 Jehovah’s enemies launch vicious attacks against us
39:11 —like some people in lands such as Russia.
39:15 Some slander us in the press or even in courts.
39:19 Some governments have banned God’s people.
39:22 Jesus said that his followers ought to expect that.
39:27 In the future, as the great tribulation gets closer,
39:31 we may have to face even more opposition.
39:34 How should we react?
39:37 Romans 12:17 says to never
39:40 “return evil for evil” in word or deed.
39:45 Regardless of what the Devil and his agents bring upon us,
39:49 by “conquering the evil with the good,” we can give a fine witness.
39:53 An important key is using gracious speech.
39:58 Proverbs 25:15:
40:00 “A mild tongue itself can break a bone.”
40:06 Jesus is the best example of not retaliating.
40:10 When the apostle Peter cut off the ear of Malchus
40:12 in the garden of Gethsemane,
40:14 Jesus reproved him and healed Malchus.
40:18 He did good to Malchus, although he was a member
40:21 of that mob that had come to arrest Jesus.
40:26 Well, Jesus was perfect; we are not.
40:30 But we need to conquer also ourselves.
40:35 We need to conquer wrong attitudes
40:38 or bad habits that we might have.
40:41 To conquer also means, according to a dictionary,
40:45 “to gain control of a problem
40:48 or difficulty through great effort.”
40:51 Many of us, when we came into the truth, have conquered the smoking habit,
40:56 overuse of alcohol, or drug addiction with great effort.
41:02 Then there is the bad habit of viewing pornography.
41:07 According to one estimate, the number of pornographic e-mails
41:12 that are sent daily
41:14 amount to 2.5 billion,
41:19 or 1.7 million per minute.
41:24 Great effort is needed
41:27 to conquer the addiction of viewing pornography.
41:34 After baptism, there may be more things to conquer
41:37 like overeating, a violent temper,
41:41 the inclination to gossip
41:43 —perhaps truthfully, but negatively about others.
41:50 It also includes conquering an exaggerated fear of men.
41:55 Faith in Jehovah will help you to conquer such fears.
41:58 Governments may try to restrict freedom to worship God.
42:03 We may even feel not sure about our own lives.
42:07 But remember:
42:08 The antidote to fear of man is faith in Jehovah.
42:13 1 John 5:5 asks:
42:15 “Who can conquer the world?
42:18 “Is it not the one who has faith
42:21 that Jesus is the Son of God?”
42:24 The previous verse, verse 4, says:
42:28 “And this is the conquest
42:30 “that has conquered the world,
42:32 our faith.”
42:34 In view of his matchless power, Jehovah could force us
42:39 to conquer every weakness without having to struggle
42:43 or to learn from our mistakes.
42:47 But why does he not do so?
42:49 Jehovah has given us the precious gift of free will.
42:54 By choosing to do God’s will and by working hard to do so,
42:58 we show the depth of our love for Jehovah
43:01 and our desire to please him.
43:05 We are conquerors even now.
43:09 Jesus did not say he will conquer at the end of the system of things.
43:13 He said that he already had conquered when he was on earth.
43:18 John 16:33 says:
43:20 “In the world you will have tribulation,
43:23 but take courage! I have conquered the world.”
43:30 In the verse before, Jesus said:
43:32 “The Father is with me.”—John 16:32.
43:36 So, yes, Jehovah helped him to conquer.
43:39 Jesus did not have to fight alone,
43:41 and neither do we have to fight alone.
43:44 Jehovah and Jesus are on our side to support us.
43:48 Paul said: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.
43:53 What can man do to me?”—Hebrews 13:6.
43:59 Be determined to keep conquering the world.
44:03 Winning one fight is not enough.
44:05 We have to keep fighting.
44:08 To conquer is a continuous action.
44:11 We need endurance.
44:13 Second Corinthians 4:16, Paul said:
44:17 “We do not give up.”
44:21 The Spanish, the Mongols, and the British
44:23 did not conquer their territories
44:26 in a day or a week or a month.
44:30 Similarly, Romans 12:21 says:
44:33 “Do not let yourself be conquered . . . ,
44:36 but keep conquering the evil with the good”
44:40 —continuous action.
44:44 Here’s a true or false.
44:46 Since we are much weaker than Jesus, and since we are imperfect,
44:50 we can conquer the evil, we can conquer the world,
44:54 but we cannot conquer Satan.
44:58 False. First John 2:14 says:
45:02 “I write you, young men, because you are strong
45:07 and the word of God remains in you and,” listen,
45:11 “you have conquered the wicked one.”
45:15 Yes, they conquered Satan back in the first century;
45:19 we can do the same today.
45:22 We will not be able to conquer Satan out of his existence.
45:27 Soon, though, Jehovah will use Jesus and the anointed
45:30 to throw Satan and the demons into an abyss of inactivity.
45:34 And at the end of the millennium,
45:36 they will crush Satan’s head completely,
45:39 according to Romans 16:20.
45:44 Satan and the demons are not conquerors of God’s people.
45:50 They are losers.
45:55 Jehovah will also direct Christ Jesus to “crush and put an end”
45:59 to all human political systems.
46:01 They also will end up being losers.
46:08 Now let’s read Romans 8:37-39,
46:17 and this assures all faithful ones.
46:21 It says:
46:26 “In all these things we are coming off completely victorious
46:31 “through the one who loved us.
46:33 “For I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels
46:37 “nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers
46:41 “nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us
46:46 from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
46:52 In review,
46:54 be assured that we can spiritually conquer the world
46:59 by remaining loyal to Jehovah, to Jesus, and to the Kingdom.
47:03 We can spiritually conquer evil
47:06 by our faith, by our love, and by doing good.
47:12 Second, we can also spiritually conquer
47:15 our own bad habits or wrong attitudes.
47:19 Third, we can spiritually conquer Satan the Devil,
47:23 and we can do it even now.
47:27 Fourth, finally,
47:29 Jesus and the anointed will completely conquer Satan,
47:33 the demons, and all human governments
47:37 in opposition to Jehovah at Armageddon
47:41 —the climax of the coming great tribulation.
47:45 What strong encouragement we have
47:49 to continue to be conquerors!
48:00 Thank you very much, Brother Lösch.
48:02 We needed those words of encouragement
48:06 to be world conquerors.
48:08 We appreciate your help.
48:12 Now pay close attention to Brother Geoffrey Jackson.
48:17 As expected, he has an intriguing title for us:
48:22 “Expect the Unexpected.”
48:31 I’m sure every one of us here today would agree
48:35 that this year’s regional convention program
48:38 was absolutely fantastic!
48:54 And probably one of the most common comments
48:58 that have been made is that many brothers and sisters have said,
49:02 “This convention has truly prepared us
49:05 for the great tribulation.”
49:07 And we certainly feel that way.
49:10 But as our minds think about the great tribulation
49:14 and the importance of Jesus’ words,
49:17 it’s true, at times that our imagination,
49:20 perhaps, becomes very active.
49:22 We may have questions:
49:24 How long will be the great tribulation?
49:28 How will it affect me personally?
49:31 Will I be able to get my medication?
49:35 What about my cat?
49:40 Well, the short answer to all those intriguing questions is:
49:45 We don’t know.
49:48 But there is something that we do know
49:52 beyond any doubt whatsoever.
49:54 Let’s turn to the book  of 2 Peter 2:9.
49:59 And this fact fills us with confidence
50:03 as we look to the future,
50:05 to the outbreak of the great tribulation.
50:08 So, 2 Peter 2:9,
50:13 there it tells us:
50:15 “So, then, Jehovah knows
50:17 how to rescue people of godly devotion out of trial.”
50:23 Yes, brothers and sisters, we know Jehovah.
50:27 We know his record.
50:29 We’ve studied the Scriptures,
50:31 and we totally believe that no matter what happens
50:36 —even though we don’t know the details of what the future holds—
50:39 we believe that Jehovah knows how to rescue righteous persons.
50:44 And we’ve seen time and time again
50:48 how Jehovah does the unexpected.
50:52 When we look through the Scriptures,
50:54 that point is emphasized over and over again.
50:59 There are two scriptures that help
51:02 to fortify this faith and belief that we have.
51:05 Let’s look at them together.
51:07 The first one is found in the book of Ephesians,
51:10 Ephesians 3:20.
51:17 Ephesians 3:20.
51:20 Here the apostle Paul under inspiration tells us:
51:24 “Now to the one who can,
51:26 “according to his power that is operating in us,
51:29 “do more than superabundantly beyond
51:33 all the things we ask or conceive.”
51:37 Now, this is a fantastic expression.
51:41 In the Writing Department, if we were to write this,
51:44 I’m sure the proofreaders would correct it.
51:47 But this is under inspiration.
51:52 For a start, let’s think of the word “superabundantly.”
51:56 Now, the proofreaders may tell us, “For a start, ‘abundant’ is enough.”
52:00 But here we have “superabundantly.”
52:05 Now, it doesn’t stop there, does it?
52:07 Because Paul then says under inspiration:
52:10 “more than superabundantly,”
52:14 and then it gets even better,
52:16 “beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”
52:21 This is certainly making the point, isn’t it?
52:24 And what is the point?
52:27 Jehovah can do things
52:30 beyond what we would expect.
52:33 It’s so interesting for us to note
52:36 that Jehovah does not limit himself
52:40 to what we ask for in our prayers.
52:42 And we can be happy of that because he goes beyond anything
52:47 that we could ever think of to solve our problems.
52:51 So, it’s true, at times we may see no way out of our problems.
52:56 We may feel overwhelmed.
52:57 But remember, what does it say here?
53:00 Jehovah has the power to “do more than superabundantly
53:04 beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”
53:08 Now the second scripture
53:10 is in the book of Philippians 4:6.
53:17 Here again, we’re told:
53:19 “Do not be anxious over anything,
53:23 “but in everything by prayer
53:25 “and supplication along with thanksgiving,
53:27 “let your petitions be made known to God;
53:31 and the peace of God that,” now notice again,
53:34 “surpasses all understanding
53:38 “will guard your hearts
53:40 and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”
53:45 Have you noticed in several of the talks today,
53:48 the point is being made over and over again
53:51 that this precious possession that we have
53:54 is our relationship with Jehovah?
53:56 We need to trust him.
53:58 Now, when the peace of God comes to us because of praying
54:02 to Jehovah and trusting him, what does it say here?
54:05 Then “that surpasses all understanding.”
54:10 Other translations put it this way:
54:13 “surpasses all our dreams,”
54:16 “excels all human planning,”
54:18 “is more wonderful than we can imagine.”
54:23 Truly, brothers and sisters,
54:25 we don’t need to know all the details of what the future holds.
54:29 We know that our loving God, Jehovah,
54:32 will do things in a wonderful way.
54:35 Yes, he does the unexpected,
54:39 and he does it with style.
54:43 That’s the amazing thing.
54:46 As we read through the Scriptures, we see this over and over again.
54:50 Let’s think about Haman
54:52 back in the days of Esther and Mordecai.
54:56 Haman had a lot of money,
54:58 a lot of influence, and a plan.
55:02 He wanted to commit genocide to destroy all of God’s people,
55:07 and it looked like the plan was going to succeed.
55:11 But Haman didn’t know what Jehovah had in mind.
55:15 Esther and Mordecai were in place.
55:19 And how things turned out!
55:21 The very day that the Jews
55:23 should have been slaughtered and completely eradicated
55:26 was the day that their enemies were killed instead.
55:30 But as we read through those events,
55:34 Jehovah did so many unexpected things.
55:37 Personally, I just love chapter 6.
55:40 Right in the middle of this intrigue
55:43 where we see what Jehovah is preparing,
55:46 then there’s an account about the king not being able to sleep.
55:50 And, isn’t it wonderful?
55:52 You see Haman comes in at the wrong time for Haman.
55:57 He assumes wrongly that the king is going to bless him.
56:02 And what’s the result?
56:04 He has to be humiliated,
56:06 walking around in front of Mordecai on a horse
56:10 wearing the king’s clothes!
56:13 That’s style!
56:17 Jehovah didn’t have to do that.
56:19 But when we look back on it,
56:21 that really is style, isn’t it?
56:25 And we can be sure that Jehovah
56:27 will continue to do these things for his people.
56:31 Recently, of course, we just watched
56:33 that beautiful presentation with regard to Hezekiah.
56:37 Didn’t that full-length movie help us to imagine
56:41 exactly what happened at that time?
56:43 But in the case of Hezekiah, what did he do
56:47 in the time leading up to that event?
56:51 Well, he fortified the city,
56:53 he stopped up the wells so the Assyrians wouldn’t be able to get water,
56:57 he did all sorts of things to plan.
57:00 And yet, none of that was needed.
57:03 Why?
57:05 He didn’t realize what Jehovah was going to do—the unexpected!
57:10 We didn’t even expect it when we saw that angel in the movie, did we?
57:15 What a wonderful presentation it was!
57:18 But, you see, Jehovah again did the unexpected.
57:22 None of his people were thinking that Jehovah would do that.
57:26 And yet, he had the situation under control.
57:30 And, of course, time and time again
57:32 as we look through the Scriptures, we see this emphasized.
57:35 Moses and the Israelites —if we were standing with them
57:39 there on the shores of the Dead Sea with the Egyptians coming behind us,
57:43 who of us would have ever guessed
57:46 that Jehovah was now going to part the Red Sea?
57:49 I mean, that was unexpected!
57:51 It was also unexpected that the Egyptians
57:54 would be so stupid to follow the Israelites.
57:57 And yet, it resulted in a wonderful victory
58:01 for Jehovah’s people.
58:03 You see, expect the unexpected
58:06 when it comes to what Jehovah does.
58:09 Now, thinking back to what the apostle Paul
58:12 was inspired to say to the brothers in Philippi,
58:15 let’s think about the setting of when he wrote that
58:19 and a little bit of the background.
58:21 The apostle Paul said, basically: “Don’t worry.
58:26 Pray because Jehovah can do the unexpected.”
58:30 Well, was Paul perhaps
58:33 writing that particular time as an academic sitting behind a desk
58:38 —someone who is testing out something he doesn’t really know about?
58:43 Of course not!
58:45 We remember back at that time, in 60 to 61 C.E.,
58:49 the apostle Paul was in prison in Rome.
58:51 He’d already experienced many, many different hardships.
58:55 He knew what it was like to be in a time of trial.
59:00 But even the very fact that he was writing
59:02 to the brothers in Philippi is of interest.
59:05 Let’s just refresh our memories about this.
59:08 You’ll see the record in Acts 16.
59:11 But what actually happened ten years before
59:16 Paul wrote the letter to the brothers in Philippi?
59:20 Well, Paul was in Asia Minor.
59:23 He was trying to find somewhere
59:26 where the holy spirit would allow him to preach.
59:28 So he went to one location—no.
59:31 He went to another location—no.
59:33 Eventually, he arrives at Troas,
59:36 and there one evening, he sees a Macedonian man.
59:41 And what does he say?
59:43 “Step over into Macedonia.”
59:47 Well, Paul naturally assumed this was Jehovah’s direction,
59:52 and immediately he made plans to step over into Macedonia.
59:56 And this actually started the preaching work in Europe.
1:00:00 Well, he arrived first at the seaport of Neapolis
1:00:04 and then made his way to Philippi.
1:00:08 Well, immediately there was some success.
1:00:11 Some started to accept the message.
1:00:14 But what happened shortly thereafter?
1:00:17 Well, as we already mentioned today,
1:00:20 the account tells us that Paul and Silas
1:00:23 were beaten up and thrown into a dungeon —into a prison.
1:00:27 Now, if you were Paul and you were sitting there in prison
1:00:32 with your back paining, singing songs to bring yourself comfort,
1:00:37 perhaps would you think this:
1:00:39 ‘What is Jehovah doing?
1:00:43 ‘I mean, I was in Asia Minor.
1:00:45 ‘I could’ve preached anywhere in Asia Minor.
1:00:48 ‘But, no, the vision said, “Step over into Macedonia.”
1:00:52 ‘Now, I’m assuming there’s a big door of activity open,
1:00:55 ‘but now here I am in prison.
1:00:59 Why did Jehovah direct me to come here?’
1:01:02 I’m sure— I think most of us would probably
1:01:05 start thinking along that line and perhaps be discouraged.
1:01:08 Perhaps, at times, you’ve felt you followed
1:01:11 Jehovah’s direction and then you’ve had problems.
1:01:14 So we’re used to understanding that situation.
1:01:18 But what happened that very night?
1:01:21 An earthquake, the doors of the prison open up,
1:01:25 the jailer and his family accept the truth
1:01:28 —and then this is where it proves again  Jehovah has style—
1:01:31 those magistrates apologize to Paul.
1:01:34 Paul says: “No, you take us out.
1:01:37 And you escort us out of the city.”
1:01:42 Now, that’s style!
1:01:45 And as we read, what do we notice?
1:01:48 I imagine this in my mind.
1:01:50 It says Paul said good-bye to Lydia.
1:01:53 And I imagine, maybe I’m wrong, but I’m imagining the magistrates
1:01:56 standing outside Lydia’s home waiting for Paul to say good-bye
1:02:00 and then continuing to escort them out of the city.
1:02:03 Now, not only is that style but it was practical
1:02:08 because it appears that, perhaps, Luke, the doctor, was left to stay there
1:02:13 in Philippi and establish the congregation.
1:02:16 And, no doubt, those magistrates would have thought twice
1:02:19 before they did anything bad to the Christians after that.
1:02:22 But, what’s the point?
1:02:25 At times, we may feel that there’s no way out of our problems.
1:02:30 But, surely, the lesson that we learn
1:02:32 over and over and over again
1:02:35 is that Jehovah can turn things completely around.
1:02:39 Yes, even though we may speculate and think: ‘What if? Maybe he’ll do this,’
1:02:44 in the end, when we look back on events,
1:02:47 we can’t help but be impressed
1:02:50 with how Jehovah handles things.
1:02:52 He has everything under control.
1:02:56 So that brings us back to the regional convention
1:02:59 —the Sunday program.
1:03:01 We all enjoyed that symposium of talks
1:03:04 with the little videos dealing with the great tribulation.
1:03:07 Maybe for most of us, it took us a while
1:03:10 to work out what they were doing in the basement.
1:03:13 Usually, by the time there was a knock, then we started to realize
1:03:18 that it was at the time of the great tribulation.
1:03:20 And with excitement, we watched as that door opened
1:03:25 and there the police, the military,
1:03:27 were facing our brothers and sisters.
1:03:30 And you were waiting!
1:03:32 Will the angel come and take them out?
1:03:35 Will fire come from heaven?
1:03:38 And we were left hanging.
1:03:40 Why?
1:03:42 The simple answer: We don’t know.
1:03:46 But one thing is for sure.
1:03:48 If Jehovah is on our side, we do not need to fear men.
1:03:53 Yes, it’s true.
1:03:55 We don’t know all the details of the great tribulation.
1:03:59 We don’t know exactly what’s going to happen in the future.
1:04:02 But, we do know that our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah God,
1:04:06 has everything under control.
1:04:09 Yes, he has style!
1:04:11 So we can expect the unexpected!
1:04:41 I used to give talks like that when I was young.
1:05:02 We have another blessing,
1:05:07 and it’s to be presented by the tongue of Brother Anthony Morris.
1:05:11 Listen carefully as he develops the theme “Run to Jehovah.”
1:05:17 I have to say, I remember those talks.
1:05:20 I miss them so much, Sam.
1:05:33 Oh boy!
1:05:35 Expect the unexpected!
1:05:37 Thank you very much.
1:05:40 Oh boy!
1:05:43 Now I have to get very serious.
1:05:55 Jehovah in his Holy Word forewarned us to expect ridicule
1:06:00 for our conviction that he’s going to destroy
1:06:03 Satan’s wicked system of things.
1:06:06 Quoting Scripture: “Where is this promised presence of his? . . .
1:06:10 All things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning.”
1:06:15 In other words, everything is the same;  nothing has really changed.
1:06:20 Are things really the same?
1:06:24 Well, here in the United States, among the many shootings
1:06:27 —I’m thinking of the one not too long ago down in Dallas, Texas—
1:06:31 this man was shooting at police officers, and they caught video of it.
1:06:36 And people didn’t know what the shooting was about
1:06:38 or who was the particular target, so they started to run.
1:06:44 They didn’t know where they were running,
1:06:46 but they were just looking for safety
1:06:49 —running, looking for safety.
1:06:52 Panic was in their faces.
1:06:54 You could see it on the video.
1:06:57 Now, during these final days of Satan’s rule,
1:07:01 all over the world, people are frightened.
1:07:04 They don’t know where to go to be safe.
1:07:08 But we have something to direct them to.
1:07:11 Turn to Proverbs chapter 18,
1:07:14 and this is where we have the theme
1:07:16 for this final talk here at our annual meeting.
1:07:21 Proverbs 18:10:
1:07:25 “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.
1:07:29 Into it the righteous one runs  and receives protection.”
1:07:34 Yes, as wickedness advances from bad to worse,
1:07:38 we have to run to Jehovah
1:07:40 to be protected, to be safe.
1:07:43 And once we’re in the tower —to remain there—
1:07:46 that means we look to Jehovah in faith, in obedience,
1:07:50 and we recognize
1:07:52 how important it is to faithfully represent that name.
1:07:57 So the purpose of this talk
1:07:59 is to encourage all of us to run to Jehovah.
1:08:02 Those of us that have run to him, don’t lose heart,
1:08:06 and be busy teaching others
1:08:09 that they better run  to Jehovah before it’s too late.
1:08:12 Now, the end is very close, and it’s obvious.
1:08:17 Why is it obvious?
1:08:19 Well, we’re going to review some fundamental truths
1:08:23 that are so spiritually fortifying.
1:08:25 And you really can’t review them often enough.
1:08:28 Matthew chapter 24,
1:08:32 and we’re going to clearly emphasize
1:08:37 why we know we’re close.
1:08:40 Matthew 24.
1:08:42 After Jesus here has mentioned what’s going to happen to the temple
1:08:46 and, of course, he gets to the third verse here
1:08:50 where the disciples in private approach him,
1:08:53 which were Peter, James,  John, and Andrew.
1:08:56 And they want to know: “When will these things be,
1:08:58 “and what will be the sign of your presence
1:09:01 and of the conclusion of the system of things?”
1:09:04 So this presence is referring to
1:09:06 Jesus’ enthronement as King in his royal visit to this earth.
1:09:11 Now, what stands out, we have the increase of lawlessness
1:09:16 —and you might keep in mind— that’s not just criminal lawlessness,
1:09:20 that’s disdain for Jehovah’s law.
1:09:23 See, people forget that.
1:09:25 And look at the disdain for Jehovah’s law.
1:09:28 Now, after he emphasizes in verse 36
1:09:31 that no human is going to know the day or the hour,
1:09:34 notice what Jesus stated, verse 37:
1:09:38 “For just as the days of Noah were,
1:09:41 “so the presence of the Son of man will be.
1:09:45 “For as they were in those days before the Flood,
1:09:48 “eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage,
1:09:52 “until the day  that Noah entered into the ark,
1:09:55 “and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away,
1:10:00 so the presence of the Son of man will be.”
1:10:05 So there we have this clear comparison
1:10:08 —it goes back to the days of Noah.
1:10:10 They took no note,
1:10:13 and we see the same today.
1:10:15 While we rejoice with the thousands
1:10:18 that are dedicating themselves to Jehovah God
1:10:21 and getting baptized each year, the fact is, all over the earth,
1:10:25 by far the majority take no note.
1:10:27 They are busy about their daily affairs,
1:10:31 and they’re not interested.
1:10:33 They don’t want to run to Jehovah.
1:10:36 It just doesn’t have any appeal to make such changes.
1:10:41 Now, what sometimes seems
1:10:44 to be forgotten is found here in Genesis 6.
1:10:48 Why did Jehovah take the action?
1:10:52 Genesis chapter 6.
1:10:54 Let’s remind ourselves of what really
1:10:58 brought this to a head
1:11:00 to where Jehovah took action.
1:11:03 And it’s connected with our day
1:11:07 because this is what’s motivating him
1:11:09 to soon take action.
1:11:12 Here we find Genesis 6:5:
1:11:17 “Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth
1:11:22 “and that every inclination
1:11:24 of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.”
1:11:28 Now, notice this —it’s very significant—verse 11:
1:11:33 “But the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God.”
1:11:36 Why?
1:11:38 “The earth was filled with violence.”
1:11:42 Sound familiar?
1:11:44 “The earth was filled with violence.”
1:11:47 It stayed that way for some time, and then, finally,
1:11:50 Jehovah is fed up with the violence.
1:11:54 And notice verse 13:
1:11:57 “After that God said to Noah:
1:11:59 “‘I have decided to put an end to all flesh,
1:12:03 “‘because the earth is full of violence
1:12:07 “‘on account of them,
1:12:10 so I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.’”
1:12:14 “Full of violence.”
1:12:16 See?
1:12:18 Same thing today —this earth is full of violence.
1:12:23 But that’s what moved Jehovah to act.
1:12:25 And then the violence continued, and finally, in chapter 7, verse 1:
1:12:30 “Go into the ark.” After years of constructing it,
1:12:33 Jehovah had had enough of the violence.
1:12:37 Now, this is pertinent.
1:12:39 In 1987, the May 15 Watchtower, page 20,
1:12:44 paragraph 18,
1:12:46 made this profound statement
1:12:49 related to the Flood  and connecting it with our day:
1:12:52 “Many of those who died in the Flood no doubt
1:12:55 “considered themselves ‘nice’ people,
1:12:58 “not being involved in the violence that filled society in those days.
1:13:03 “But just being ‘nice’ did not save them.
1:13:07 “By their apathy
1:13:09 “they condoned the evil of their day.
1:13:12 “The crucial thing was that they did not ‘run’ to Jehovah;
1:13:17 “they did not listen when God’s servant spoke.
1:13:21 “So they did not take the proper steps
1:13:24 for survival.”
1:13:26 And that’s where we are now.
1:13:29 People must understand.
1:13:32 We have to preach and teach them.
1:13:34 They need to run to Jehovah now before it’s too late.
1:13:39 And during his presence, all through these decades
1:13:42 ruling in the midst of his enemies,
1:13:45 you have to accept the fact that the degree of violence
1:13:48 at this point is mind-numbing.
1:13:52 It’s just all over the earth—violence.
1:13:56 And it isn’t just because of the media and the Internet and such;
1:14:01 it’s just filled with violence.
1:14:04 So keep that in mind, and we see that today.
1:14:07 And something else Jesus connected
1:14:09 when he was comparing his presence with the days of Noah
1:14:13 —note this here in Luke 17.
1:14:17 And this is the second thing that just makes it very obvious
1:14:21 we are so close,
1:14:23 and Jehovah is going to take action.
1:14:29 And this is his judgment.
1:14:31 Now, we would have people in general—
1:14:34 Some countries would find
1:14:36 what we’re going to discuss here  hate-mongering,
1:14:40 but we will never water down Jehovah’s Word,
1:14:44 sticking close with it.
1:14:45 These are the words of Jesus Christ.
1:14:48 If they want to take issue with him, let them go ahead.
1:14:54 Luke chapter 17, the Pharisees want to know when the Kingdom is coming.
1:14:58 Now, in verse 26 of Luke 17,
1:15:01 he makes the connection about the days of Noah,
1:15:04 which we just addressed and how he entered into the ark.
1:15:08 Now, let’s read 28 through 30:
1:15:11 “Likewise, just as it occurred in the days of Lot:
1:15:15 “they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling,
1:15:18 “they were planting, they were building.
1:15:21 “But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom,
1:15:24 “it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all.
1:15:30 “It will be the same on that day
1:15:33 when the Son of man is revealed.”
1:15:35 Oh yeah.
1:15:39 When Jesus is revealed at the great tribulation, that’s it.
1:15:45 Jehovah is fed up with the sexual depravity as well.
1:15:49 Now, two other Bible writers connect these two events,
1:15:54 and that’s why we see how close we are.
1:15:56 If you look at the world today, it’s right before our eyes.
1:16:00 Notice Jude, here.
1:16:02 Let’s turn over to Jude.
1:16:04 And he was inspired
1:16:09 to encourage us, especially those who’ve already run to Jehovah.
1:16:16 Jude 6,
1:16:20 and we’re going to read 6 in the letter of Jude:
1:16:29 “And the angels who did not keep their original position
1:16:33 “but forsook  their own proper dwelling place,
1:16:36 “he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness
1:16:41 for the judgment of the great day.”
1:16:43 So here we have it.
1:16:46 This was a perversion —unnatural—
1:16:50 and he was addressing this.
1:16:53 Jehovah inspired Jude to write this.
1:16:56 These disobedient angels materialized bodies, as we all know,
1:17:01 and cohabited with women, and they produced offspring
1:17:05 —half-human, half-demon.
1:17:07 A very difficult time for the earth,
1:17:10 and Jehovah found that despicable.
1:17:13 Now, this part of what happened prior
1:17:17 to the Flood of Noah’s day
1:17:19 is connected with verse 7, this sexual depravity.
1:17:23 Let’s read verse 7:
1:17:25 “In the same manner,
1:17:28 “Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them
1:17:32 “also gave themselves over
1:17:35 “to gross sexual immorality
1:17:39 “and pursued unnatural fleshly desires;
1:17:42 “they are placed before us as a warning example
1:17:46 “by undergoing the judicial punishment
1:17:50 of everlasting fire.”
1:17:53 So Jehovah doesn’t mince any words here.
1:17:57 This sexual depravity
1:17:59 found in the cities throughout this earth,
1:18:02 he’s had enough of it.
1:18:04 And you’d have to admit
1:18:07 that just like the Scriptures bring out
1:18:09 in Genesis chapters 13 and 18,
1:18:14 Jehovah said this “cry of complaint” was going up.
1:18:19 And all of the perverted ones
1:18:21 —and not just Sodom and Gomorrah, but the cities nearby—
1:18:25 and this cry of complaint was just too much
1:18:30 for Jehovah to take, and he took action.
1:18:32 However, what about our day?
1:18:35 Well, the sexual depravity—
1:18:38 They don’t think they’re depraved,
1:18:41 and our saying so
1:18:44 is judgmental, offensive
1:18:48 —at least to them.
1:18:50 And we don’t intend to try to deliberately offend people.
1:18:54 We just— This is what the Scriptures teach.
1:18:57 It’s perverted,
1:19:00 and we support Jehovah’s judgment on that.
1:19:03 However, the spirit of Satan’s world is:
1:19:06 “How foolish to believe that the story
1:19:09 “of the Flood and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah are true.
1:19:12 You people are foolish!”
1:19:16 Well, these stories are true.
1:19:20 And Peter really makes it very clear here
1:19:24 as he was inspired to write this,
1:19:26 2 Peter and the second chapter.
1:19:31 And so we love Jehovah
1:19:36 for inspiring him to make this so clear
1:19:38 because it helps us to understand how close we are.
1:19:41 And 2 Peter 2:4-6:
1:19:46 “Certainly God did not refrain
1:19:49 “from punishing the angels who sinned, but threw them into Tartarus,
1:19:53 “putting them in chains of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment.
1:19:57 “And he did not refrain  from punishing an ancient world,
1:20:00 “but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness,
1:20:03 “safe with seven others  when he brought a flood
1:20:07 upon a world of ungodly people.”
1:20:09 Now, notice this profound point, verse 6:
1:20:12 “And by reducing the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes,
1:20:17 “he condemned them,
1:20:19 “setting a pattern
1:20:21 for ungodly people of things to come.”
1:20:24 That’s the pattern
1:20:27 for all these ungodly people.
1:20:29 What Jehovah did in the Flood
1:20:32 as well as in the day of Sodom and Gomorrah
1:20:36 and judged them there —there’s the pattern.
1:20:39 That’s their future if they choose not to run to Jehovah.
1:20:45 So considering this Scriptural evidence
1:20:48 —the earth is filled with violence and sexual depravity—
1:20:52 it’s just so clear we’re so close to the great tribulation.
1:20:57 And contemplating what may occur
1:20:59 —and it connects with Brother Jackson’s comments about the great tribulation—
1:21:03 we just need to ‘trust in Jehovah with all our heart
1:21:06 and not lean on our own understanding.’
1:21:09 And how reassuring to know that very soon no one will worry
1:21:14 about their safety or the safety of their loved ones.
1:21:18 The violence of the last days will be done away with.
1:21:21 All the sexually immoral people who brazenly flaunt
1:21:25 our precious Jehovah’s laws will be destroyed,
1:21:29 just as they were in Sodom and Gomorrah.
1:21:32 So rest assured, Jehovah hears our cry of complaint.
1:21:37 Do not lose heart.
1:21:39 All you righteous worshippers of the true God, remember:
1:21:43 “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.
1:21:46 Into it the righteous one runs and receives protection.”
1:22:18 Thank you very much, Brother Morris.
1:22:20 That was a fine conclusion to this wonderful program.
1:22:25 We have received blessings galore
1:22:29 in the form of things
1:22:31 that ‘are true, serious concern,
1:22:35 ‘righteous, chaste,
1:22:37 ‘lovable, well-spoken-of,
1:22:41 virtuous, praiseworthy,’
1:22:44 “good and acceptable.”
1:22:48 We already announced that depending
1:22:50 on the direction you will be going
1:22:54 when you leave the building,
1:22:56 you can use the side doors onto Pavonia Avenue
1:23:01 or go through the main lobby and exit through the front.
1:23:07 Well, is there any other announcement that I could make?
1:23:14 Yes, there is.
1:23:18 In fact, the Governing Body requested
1:23:20 that the following announcement be made today.
1:23:23 Are you ready?
1:23:27 Well, let me set the stage for the announcement.
1:23:30 As you might have guessed,
1:23:33 there have been many questions
1:23:36 and some wild speculations
1:23:39 about the upcoming dedication program
1:23:42 for the Wallkill and Warwick completed facilities.
1:23:46 You’re about to get the definitive answer.
1:23:49 Our announcement reads this way:
1:23:53 “The Governing Body is pleased to inform you that the new facilities
1:23:57 “at Wallkill and Warwick will be dedicated in conjunction
1:24:01 “with the annual meeting program on October 7, 2017.
1:24:06 “The annual meeting and dedication program will originate
1:24:10 “from world headquarters in the auditorium at Warwick.
1:24:14 “Hence, the number of attendees  that will enjoy it live
1:24:19 “in the auditorium will be limited.
1:24:22 “However, the Governing Body has approved that the program
1:24:26 “will be streamed to all Bethel facilities in the United States
1:24:31 “and all Assembly Halls in the United States,
1:24:34 “including here at the Jersey City Assembly Hall.
1:24:37 “In this way, it is hoped that all who volunteered to work
1:24:42 “on the Wallkill and Warwick projects will be able to attend the annual meeting
1:24:47 “and the dedication program associated therewith.
1:24:52 “However, the program will not be streamed
1:24:55 “to other branch offices or Assembly Halls in other lands.
1:24:59 “The United States Branch Committee
1:25:01 “will be providing more details about the arrangements in due time.
1:25:05 “Again, the dedication of Wallkill and Warwick facilities
1:25:09 “will be in connection with the annual meeting
1:25:12 “on October 7, 2017.
1:25:16 Your brothers, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
1:25:41 That brings us to the conclusion of our program,
1:25:44 and I invite all of you to stand and sing another of our new songs.
1:25:49 We know it for the time being as song number 136:
1:25:54 “The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!”
1:25:57 Please sing this majestic song with full throat,
1:26:02 just as it deserves, song number 136.

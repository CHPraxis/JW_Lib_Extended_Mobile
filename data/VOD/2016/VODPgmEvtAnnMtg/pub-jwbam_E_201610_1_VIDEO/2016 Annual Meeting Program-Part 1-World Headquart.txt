00:00 You are probably
00:02 the most obedient group  of people this size
00:06 that has ever entered Jersey City.
00:22 So we say,  “Thank you very much
00:25 for being in your seats.”
00:28 It’s now my pleasure  to invite you to stand
00:31 and to sing song number 150,
00:34 “Reaching Out,”  Matthew 9:37, 38.
03:33 What a marvelous gift from God it is.
03:40 We all have one.
03:43 It’s a bit larger in men than it is in women.
03:48 What is it?
03:51 It’s in your mouth.
03:53 It’s your tongue.
03:56 A small muscle, a little over three inches long.
04:01 We do so many things with it
04:03 —you can whisper with it; you can yell with it;
04:08 you can swallow your food with its help;
04:12 and it’s so versatile;  you can stick it out.
04:19 Over in Tibet,
04:21 they stick out the tongue, some of them,
04:24 and it’s a sign of friendship and greeting.
04:27 Don’t you try that here!
04:34 It stays out of the way of your teeth
04:36 when you chew,  well, most of the time.
04:43 It is an arduous job
04:45 trying to control the tongue,
04:49 but James had something  to say about it.
04:51 Let’s see what he had to say.
04:52 Let’s turn to James
04:55 in our Bibles or iPads.
04:58 That’s the third chapter of his book,
05:01 and we’re going to read
5 through 10:
05:04 “So, too, the tongue  is a small part of the body,
05:09 “and yet it makes great brags.
05:11 “See how small a fire it takes
05:13 “to set a great forest ablaze!
05:16 “The tongue is also a fire.
05:18 “The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness
05:21 “among our body members,
05:23 “for it defiles all the body
05:25 “and sets the whole course of life on fire,
05:29 “and it is set on fire by Gehenna.
05:32 “For every kind of wild animal and bird
05:35 “and reptile and sea creature
05:39 “is to be tamed  and has been tamed by humans.
05:44 “But no human can tame the tongue.
05:48 “It is unruly and injurious,
05:51 “full of deadly poison.
05:54 “With it we praise Jehovah, the Father,
05:57 “and yet with it we curse men
06:00 “who have come into existence
06:03 “‘in the likeness of God.’
06:05 “Out of the same mouth
06:09 come blessing and cursing.”
06:13 In our imperfect state,
06:15 we can’t completely control it.
06:19 Oh, we try,  and we must try,
06:21 but we just can’t get the job completely done.
06:25 But we’re not going to give up.
06:28 We’re going to keep trying.
06:31 We’re going to watch, though, what we have to say
06:33 —what comes out of the mouth, what rolls as a result of the tongue.
06:37 We’re going to be very careful.
06:39 And we know that we must rein in
06:42 a runaway tongue
06:44 and curb its wagging.
06:47 Although blessing  and cursing can come out
06:51 of the mouth by use of the tongue
06:54 you will only hear blessings out of the mouths
06:59 of the speakers  and participants today.
07:03 These Christians  have bridled their tongues.
07:07 Thank God for that.
07:12 Today we are going to  consider things that are—
07:15 Now, you want to jot these down
07:17 because we’re going to mention them  several times through the day.
07:21 Here they are:
07:24 ‘true,
07:26 ‘things of serious concern,
07:29 ‘righteous, chaste,
07:31 ‘lovable, well-spoken-of,
07:35 virtuous, praiseworthy,’
07:38 “good and acceptable.”
07:43 The tongue will work good  for us today, not bad.
07:48 So we say, “sit still,”
07:50 and may your ears
07:53 keep up with the tongues
07:56 of all of our participants.
08:00 And as you know,
08:02 in our September JW Broadcasting program,
08:06 Brother Splane told us  that the move of Bethel family members
08:11 to the world headquarters facility
08:13 in Warwick, New York,  is in progress.
08:17 It is already a bustling complex
08:20 with so many relocated
08:23 and caring for their assignments.
08:26 This represents a historic change
08:30 since the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses
08:33 had been located in Brooklyn, New York,
08:38 for over 100 years.
08:45 We’re all happy,
08:47 and it’s good for us who live there.
08:50 It’s such a beautiful place indeed
08:53 and so restful.
08:55 All of us feel like we have been able
08:58 to add years to our lives.
09:04 We can hear birds sing,
09:07 crickets at night, frogs
09:11 —every now and then,  there’s an eagle that flies over—
09:15 bears, and snakes.
09:19 But we’ve been warned to watch out.
09:22 We know what to do.
09:24 And we’re just enjoying ourselves
09:27 as much as we possibly can.
09:31 Well, we now invite you
09:34 to enjoy a video presentation
09:36 about the history  of headquarters in Brooklyn
09:39 and the move to Warwick.
09:42 So we say,  “Enjoy what you see.”
09:45 And here is
09:47 —look at your notes—
09:49 true.
09:59 Why are we here at Bethel today  in New York City?
10:05 Why did Pastor Russell leave Pittsburgh?
10:08 To expand the ministry worldwide.
10:12 But look at it today.
10:15 The satisfaction to see
10:17 and the blessing of seeing the work  expand “to the ends of the earth”
10:22 and God’s will being done.
10:24 In 1909,  Jehovah led his people
10:28 in making a move that would become
10:30 an indelible part of our spiritual heritage.
10:33 For years,  the Pennsylvania location
10:35 had been adequate for the work  of spreading the good news.
10:38 But as time went on,  challenges arose.
10:43 Pittsburgh’s reputation  was one of steel and industry,
10:47 not really one of religion and faith.
10:49 The organization at that time was trying  to get the preaching work accomplished,
10:53 and it wasn’t really  well-suited in Pittsburgh.
10:58 So they struggled to find a city that would work for them,
11:02 and one of the cities  that they came across was Brooklyn.
11:05 It was very famous  for its pastors and its churches.
11:09 It was actually nicknamed  “The City of Churches,”
11:11 and that was a good reputation
11:13 to springboard the preaching work from.
11:15 They were trying to preach  the good news to the entire earth,
11:18 but with so few Bible Students,  how could they possibly do it?
11:23 And then they realized the cultural base
11:26 that existed in New York City was broad,
11:29 and so they felt that this put them in the perfect position
11:32 to preach to people
11:35 and have them help the Bible Students  take the message back to their homelands.
11:39 Brooklyn, just far and above,  was the obvious choice to them.
11:43 Officially, Brooklyn Bethel
11:45 opened its doors in April 1909.
11:49 These were years  of tremendous activity
11:52 leading up to 1914.
11:54 They also proved  to be times of test.
12:01 The United States  had declared war on Germany.
12:05 From March through July of 1918,
12:08 eight different brothers  who were taking the lead at that time
12:11 were arrested, sentenced,  and taken off
12:15 to a federal penitentiary.
12:17 The Executive Committee at headquarters
12:20 consulted with other brothers.
12:22 It was decided to sell  the Brooklyn Tabernacle
12:25 and to close the Bethel home.
12:28 So we moved here in 1909,
12:31 and within ten years,  Brooklyn Bethel was closed.
12:36 The headquarters operations  were moved back to Pittsburgh.
12:41 In the year 1919,
12:44 when the brothers  were finally released from prison,
12:46 Brother Rutherford apprehended rapidly:
12:50 ‘There’s still great interest in the work,
12:53 ‘and Jehovah is still blessing  and backing us.
12:56 ‘We need to get back, organize it, and get on
12:59 with the work that has been started.’
13:01 So should they start from scratch
13:05 and build a Bethel there in Allegheny,  or should they utilize
13:08 the property that they  already owned in Brooklyn?
13:11 They wanted to see if that  was actually Jehovah’s will.
13:13 So, what Judge Rutherford  did is he asked
13:17 Brother C. A. Wise,  who was his vice president,
13:19 ‘We need to do a test to see if Jehovah  is going to bless this direction.’
13:24 During wartime,  any raw materials
13:28 —paper, fuel, all of those things— are regulated
13:31 because the war effort is going on.
13:34 So this was a perfect test to see
13:36 if it would enable  the brothers to get coal.
13:39 He sent him back here,  and he said: ‘Don’t just get a little coal.
13:42 ‘Get enough so that it is obvious
13:46 that if we get this coal,  it is only by Jehovah’s blessing.’
13:49 Brother Rutherford directed Brother Wise
13:52 to order 500 tons of coal.
13:54 And what was the outcome?
13:57 When he applied to the authorities,
13:58 he was granted a certificate  to obtain 500 tons of coal
14:03 —enough to care for their needs  for years to come.
14:07 So in 1919 —September, I believe—
14:11 is when they actually moved back  from Allegheny to Brooklyn.
14:16 Once it was determined  that Brooklyn, New York,
14:18 would be the new world headquarters,
14:20 how would Jehovah use this new location
14:23 to advance the preaching work?
14:25 Well, we were dependent back then  on commercial printeries.
14:30 Brother Rutherford wondered whether
14:32 we could  print The Watchtower ourselves.
14:36 And so a printing press was obtained, and a printery was set up.
14:40 And in time, the book printing began.
14:44 Outside commercial companies thought  that we would never be capable
14:48 of printing and binding books.
14:53 But the brothers applied themselves, learned,
14:57 and with the support of the Lord, they got it going.
15:02 It was so evident  that Jehovah was using Brooklyn Bethel.
15:04 All the printing and binding  was done for the world
15:09 here in Brooklyn.
15:11 After that,
15:13 the organization took in brothers,  under the direction of the Governing Body,
15:17 to come and learn what they could  in Brooklyn and take it with them
15:22 back to their countries and see what they could do
15:25 about lightening the load a little  as far as the printing
15:29 and distribution was concerned.
15:39 Soon after I got to Bethel in Japan,
15:42 I worked on the web press.
15:44 We always looked up to Brooklyn  as our “big brother,”
15:49 and we always looked  to them for direction.
15:51 Anytime we were able to come back to the United States on a brief visit,
15:55 I would always make sure
15:56 to see what was new  and to talk with the brothers.
15:59 And the brothers  were always very helpful.
16:02 So you saw how Jehovah used
16:05 this place to get the spiritual food out
16:09 to the worldwide association of the brothers.
16:12 It is clear that Jehovah  had blessed the advancement
16:15 of the printing and distribution work  in Brooklyn Bethel.
16:18 But to further share the truth globally
16:21 in a way that would truly touch hearts,
16:24 other challenges needed to be addressed.
16:26 Zechariah 8:23 says
16:31 that ‘ten men out of all the languages  of the nations
16:34 will grab hold of the skirt  of a man who is a Jew.’
16:38 Now, that’s a lot of languages.
16:40 But for every person
16:44 to understand,
16:46 they have to hear it in their language.
16:50 Though we were translating
16:52 into many languages, many of these  were not simultaneous with English.
16:56 Some of them  lagged behind for many months.
17:01 And, of course,  there were many languages
17:03 that didn’t have  any literature at all.
17:06 And so the Governing Body  saw the situation,
17:10 and they created the department Translation Services.
17:12 Some of the early languages
17:15 were translated right here in Brooklyn.
17:19 Eventually, translation work was moved out
17:21 to the branches  where they speak those languages.
17:25 The 20th century saw  many technological advancements.
17:28 How did Jehovah guide his servants
17:30 at Brooklyn Bethel to make progressive use
17:33 of these advancements  to further the preaching work
17:37 to “all the languages of the nations”?
17:39 Well, the challenges
17:41 of developing a computer
17:43 that could actually type and compose  in all of those languages
17:47 were enormous  in the late seventies and early eighties.
17:50 I think the brothers could see  that technology was changing.
17:54 Things were changing  from letterpress to offset printing;
17:58 things were going from black and white
18:00 to color.
18:03 So I think all the pieces began to be there
18:05 to look at the idea of MEPS.
18:07 I kind of liken it to our “moon shot.”
18:11 In other words,  can you get there and back?
18:14 Jehovah provided the right people  at the right time
18:18 —people who had previous expertise  with building computer systems
18:22 and people who had some expertise  with languages.
18:25 And what has always fascinated me
18:27 is Jehovah’s use of the timing  of when to use the technologies.
18:36 Jehovah put Bethel in Brooklyn.
18:40 And he would know at any given time
18:43 —strategically and geographically— where would be the best place
18:47 for his world headquarters,  and for decades,
18:52 it was Brooklyn.
18:54 In 1971, when you looked out  over the East River,
18:58 you know what you saw along the shoreline?
19:01 A whole row of freighters.
19:04 And then the fact that we had  our printery just a few blocks away,
19:08 revealed why it was beneficial  to have Bethel here in Brooklyn.
19:13 Now, you look out over the East River,  what do you see?
19:16 It’s a park.
19:18 You have swimming pools there;  it’s full of people.
19:20 The purpose has changed,
19:22 and the reasons for our being here  have in many ways disappeared.
19:29 Because of the way things  are developing in the world
19:31 and because of Brooklyn  in New York City
19:35 being where it is in the world scene,
19:38 it’s time for us to get things  moved out of Brooklyn
19:42 and to a new world headquarters  where we can be even more fruitful.
19:45 In 2011,
19:47 Jehovah was again leading his people
19:51 in another historic move.
19:53 We’d like to let you know  that the Governing Body has decided
19:56 that if the approvals are received  for the Warwick project,
20:01 we will be moving  completely out of Brooklyn.
20:05 The world headquarters  will be relocated at Warwick.
20:10 When it was announced,  the plans of establishing world headquarters
20:13 in what is going to be in Warwick,
20:16 it just seemed like it was so far away.
20:18 We may not even live to that.
20:20 But the time has passed quite quickly,
20:23 and now it’s virtually on our doorstep.
20:26 It’s happening!
20:28 We have seen  that Jehovah
20:31 can use any location.
20:34 We have beautiful facilities now
20:36 at Wallkill, Patterson, soon Warwick
20:38 —beautiful facilities
20:40 that Jehovah will use to the full just as he used Brooklyn.
20:44 And it becomes so evident
20:46 that this is not an organization of men.
20:48 We’re not dedicated  to a building or to a city;
20:52 we are dedicated to Jehovah.
20:54 And when you sense his direction
20:56 in this matter of relocating
20:59 and doing things differently, you can’t help but—
21:03 OK, we back off the sentimentality,
21:05 and let’s go ahead and do the work
21:07 as Jehovah has outlined for us today.
21:09 I’ve always concluded  that when it works,
21:11 Jehovah is behind it.
21:14 So Warwick worked beautifully.
21:18 And if you ever get to Warwick  and you see
21:21 Warwick as it is now, you’ll say,
21:23 “This is the place that Jehovah wanted us to be.”
21:27 Jehovah had Brooklyn in place,
21:29 some parts of it for over a hundred years.
21:33 And it served so well  as a base for the Governing Body,
21:37 as a base for printing and providing  spiritual food worldwide,
21:43 as a base for direction
21:45 for congregations worldwide,
21:48 and now Jehovah  has something else in mind.
21:51 With the way things turned out,
21:54 it wasn’t a man or a group of men
21:58 who back in the early 1900’s said:
22:00 “You know what we need to do?
22:02 “We’ll stay here about a hundred years.
22:04 “And then we’ll have a place  up north of the city
22:07 “and we’ll move there  and we’ll sell all these buildings
22:11 and then it’ll be  a real boost to the work.”
22:13 No man or a group of men did that.
22:16 But Jehovah and Christ Jesus
22:18 —they direct the brothers
22:20 at the right time in the right place  to make the decisions
22:24 that may seem for the present,  just for the present.
22:27 But Jehovah sees the end
22:29 from the very beginning.
22:31 Yes, world headquarters in Brooklyn
22:34 has been the hub of our global preaching work
22:37 throughout the 20th century.
22:39 Despite many twists and turns,
22:41 Jehovah has used this location
22:43 to advance his will in unprecedented ways.
22:47 While we think back fondly  on all that was accomplished here,
22:51 we know going forward,  there is only more to come.
23:59 That was most interesting.
24:01 But save your hands;  there’s more coming.
24:04 So we’re not looking back on Brooklyn,
24:07 but we are moving forward
24:10 —one step closer to our future hope.
24:15 And as you know,
24:17 I just love acronyms and abbreviations
24:22 —PC, WC,
24:25 WDC, LDC—
24:30 but what does CPC stand for?
24:34 Well, in the video just seen,
24:38 you got a glimpse  of the beautiful new little city
24:43 built on a lake in Warwick.
24:45 So the CPC helped make that happen.
24:50 What does the CPC stand for?
24:54 CPC stands for  Construction Project Committee.
24:59 Lock that in.
25:02 Though that committee  lived and breathed
25:05 the Warwick project  for a number of years,
25:09 it was really  a Governing Body directed project.
25:13 However,  the Construction Project Committee
25:16 was given the latitude  to make many
25:19 of the detail-oriented decisions
25:23 on their own.
25:25 Now, how did this assignment  affect these brothers?
25:29 Did they give it
25:31 serious concern?
25:35 Let’s pay attention  to a prerecorded interview
25:39 of the CPC
25:41 conducted by Brother Harold Corkern,
25:46 a helper for the Publishing Committee  of the Governing Body.
25:49 The video is entitled
25:53 Building for the Future.
25:57 The construction  of the new world headquarters
25:59 at Warwick, New York, was indeed a historic project.
26:04 The Construction Project Committee  certainly saw evidence
26:07 of Jehovah’s blessing  and guidance upon them.
26:10 But they also realized
26:12 that he was building  more than just a new facility;
26:16 he was building qualities
26:19 that are so necessary  for his people.
26:22 And this we’ll see as we talk  to our CPC members.
26:26 At this time,  it would be good for us
26:28 to introduce  the Construction Project Committee.
26:31 We’ll do so alphabetically.
26:33 We have  Brother Ken Caughron,
26:36 Brother Kenneth Chernish,
26:38 Brother Richard Devine,
26:40 Brother Enrique Ford, and
26:42 Brother Troy Snyder.
26:43 One of the first questions  we’d like to ask you is:
26:47 When you first got this assignment
26:49 and you learned of the scope
26:52 and all the work that was involved
26:55 and the established completion date,
26:57 what was your first reaction?
27:00 And we’ll start with  Brother Richard Devine.
27:03 Well, I was excited  but overwhelmed
27:06 —overwhelmed not just  by the size of the project
27:09 and the expedited schedule
27:11 but especially by the level of trust
27:13 that the Governing Body  had put in the five of us.
27:15 I was used to recommendations  being reviewed
27:17 by multiple layers of oversight
27:19 and decisions taking weeks  or months to arrive at.
27:23 And here the Governing Body told us
27:25 that we were to report only  to the Publishing Committee.
27:28 And once a budget was established,
27:30 to use our best judgment,  carry out the work,
27:33 and come back to them for direction  only if we exceeded our budget.
27:37 Brother Troy Snyder, what would you like to add?
27:40 The emotions varied  from being scared to excited.
27:44 And like any new assignment, you think about how much work
27:47 is going to be needed to accomplish it.
27:49 But then when really meditating  on the scope of the job
27:52 and the time frame that was desired,
27:55 you started to feel inadequate,
27:58 and there was just no way  you could do it.
28:00 But then you started to realize  that Jehovah was behind you.
28:03 He was the one  who was directing matters.
28:06 He had confidence that we could do it.
28:08 And so as a result,  you knew you could really lean on him
28:11 and look at him as a fellow worker.
28:13 And that really helped set the pace.
28:15 Brother Ford.
28:17 The first thing I realized is
28:19 that if this project  was going to be successful,
28:22 it was going to be  because of Jehovah’s holy spirit.
28:25 That was clear because  from a human perspective
28:29 it was literally impossible,
28:31 but it was what Jehovah  had asked us to do.
28:34 And the other thing  that occurred to me
28:37 was that Jehovah  wasn’t going to bless
28:40 our standard approach  of developing projects.
28:43 Brother Ken Caughron?
28:45 We were living and working  on the Nigeria branch construction project
28:50 at Igieduma out  in the beautiful African bush.
28:54 So my first feeling was,
28:56 ‘Did they dial the wrong number?’
28:58 But within 30 minutes,  we returned the phone call.
29:02 We were very happy  to accept the privilege to go.
29:06 As far as a completion date,
29:08 if we would have known  all the details at that time
29:11 of how Warwick  would be constructed,
29:14 where would  the faith have been?
29:16 So it wasn’t our assignment
29:19 at that time to know all the details.
29:21 It was our assignment to have faith
29:23 in the invisible One, Jehovah,
29:26 and move forward  with that conviction.
29:29 Brother Ken Chernish,  what would you like to add?
29:32 I could not believe
29:34 that Jehovah would put  that much trust in me.
29:38 I’ll never forget  going to bed that night,
29:40 laying down, eyes wide open
29:43 —they remained open all night long—
29:46 just praying to Jehovah.
29:48 We didn’t have  construction documents.
29:50 We didn’t have permits.
29:52 We didn’t even have design  on some of the buildings.
29:55 From a secular perspective,  it couldn’t be done in four years.
29:58 And I realized I just needed  to have the faith
30:02 to follow Jehovah’s lead and  to work with these brothers
30:05 and that schedule  would become attainable.
30:07 When you first started working  as a committee,
30:11 were there any challenges
30:14 on learning how  to work together as a committee?
30:16 And if so,  how did you address them?
30:20 And we’ll start  with Brother Ford.
30:22 I remember a visit from one  Governing Body member,
30:25 and he made the statement
30:27 that they wanted  this not to be a Bethel project,
30:31 not to be an RBC project,  but to be a CPC project
30:35 —a totally different approach.
30:37 So that assured me  that the Governing Body
30:40 deliberately wanted us  to blend together
30:44 these five different  approaches and personalities.
30:47 Brother Richard Devine?
30:49 We all brought different  paradigms to the table,
30:51 different ways of thinking,  even a different language in some cases.
30:54 And so it took a while for us  to understand each other.
30:58 And so we, early on,  decided to try to take advantage
31:01 of everything  that the brotherhood could offer
31:03 and try to blend the different approaches  to achieve the success
31:08 that, really, we were hoping for  with Jehovah’s blessing.
31:11 And as time went on,  we really began to respect each other
31:14 and draw close together  as a committee and as friends.
31:19 What I appreciated  was in our meetings,
31:20 the brothers felt comfortable  expressing themselves
31:23 and their viewpoints  even if it differed from others.
31:27 My challenge was lack  of Bethel experience
31:30 —still is.
31:32 Yet, these brothers  were so patient with me,
31:35 so protective of me, even,  and in caring for me,
31:40 in understanding how much different  my background was,
31:43 the way I went about making decisions,  the way I expressed myself.
31:47 Yet, they understood that.
31:49 I also prayed to show honor
31:51 to these brothers and to take the lead.
31:53 I did a good job of it sometimes  and not so good at other times.
31:56 But I have  really tried to rely on Jehovah
31:59 in that way  to overcome the challenge.
32:01 The biggest challenge  for me was myself.
32:04 I could quickly see
32:06 why Jehovah had brought  the other brothers together
32:09 with their experience  in construction,
32:12 in engineering,  in business administration,
32:15 and many years  at world headquarters.
32:17 But I felt apprehensive  about my experience
32:21 and even hesitant sometimes  to express myself.
32:25 But I kept up  my spiritual routines
32:28 —field service, prayer,  meditation, and so forth.
32:31 And in time,  I realized that I needed
32:34 to show more personal faith
32:36 —well, specifically to show more faith
32:38 in not comparing ourselves to others
32:42 and not neglecting the gifts
32:45 that we do have to offer to Jehovah.
32:47 So I benefited from every brother  on the committee.
32:50 I’m refined,  and I’m very thankful
32:53 to Jehovah for helping me grow.
32:55 It’s very commendable,  a good example for us.
32:58 Our next question:
33:00 Given the magnitude
33:03 of this project
33:05 and the date  that was established for completion,
33:10 what organizational  and logistical challenges
33:15 did you find most daunting?
33:19 Brother Devine?
33:21 At our peak,  we were processing
33:23 over 11,000 requisition lines a month.
33:25 We were delivering  over 1,000 pallets a week to the site.
33:30 It was an incredible challenge.
33:32 And it really would have been impossible  without Jehovah’s blessing
33:36 and the hard work of our  Procurement and Purchasing Departments.
33:40 Designers, by their training and background,  are used to planning.
33:45 They’re used to starting a project
33:47 with the determination  of how long it would take
33:50 to get the design finished  and then scheduling forward.
33:53 So from day one,
33:55 I realized  that if we could not find a way
34:00 completed very quickly and on time,  the project would grind to a halt.
34:04 So that was very daunting for me.
34:07 At that time, the Wallkill project  was still in full swing.
34:10 And they were feeding us  volunteers and overseers,
34:13 really,  at will when we asked for them,
34:16 but they were still  not going to be enough.
34:18 We were going to need  to do heavy site work
34:21 simultaneous with building  and construction.
34:24 That’s not necessarily  the best way to go about it.
34:28 There are a lot of clashes  when that happens.
34:31 It makes workers less productive
34:34 because it’s hard  to move around the spaces.
34:37 We were going to have  all six major buildings
34:40 in construction simultaneously.
34:42 We’d come to find out  we were going to need
34:44 to have 11 cranes  swinging in the air.
34:47 These things, along with 20 telehandlers  going around the site,
34:51 moving this material  that Rich talked about,
34:53 were going to be daunting.
34:55 And Brother Ken Caughron?
34:57 One aspect of my assignment  was to work with safety.
35:01 So it was very daunting  in the beginning to imagine:
35:06 How will we provide  safety orientation and training
35:11 to thousands  of volunteers coming in?
35:14 And then,  what would be the best way
35:18 to motivate  our brothers and sisters
35:20 on the very serious subject  of safety?
35:24 And safety is a concern of all  of Jehovah’s people
35:27 no matter what we’re doing.
35:29 Brother Troy Snyder.
35:31 We needed the high skill.
35:33 We needed the friends to come.
35:34 We needed large amounts  as Brother Chernish mentioned.
35:37 But how would we care for them?
35:39 At one point, we grew  in an eight-month period over a thousand,
35:44 and we did.
35:46 What type of rooming  would we have for them?
35:48 How would we care for them  spiritually and physically?
35:51 At one time,  we found ourselves
35:53 with a kitchen and dining room  designed for 200 and trying to feed
35:56 about 1,000 people.
35:58 We certainly could feel that  it was as if Jesus
36:01 was in that kitchen  multiplying the loaves.
36:04 You had good support.
36:06 But now,  you’ve enumerated understandable
36:11 concerns and challenges.
36:14 Could you give some examples  on how those were resolved?
36:18 And we’ll come back  to Brother Caughron for this one.
36:21 We realized that we wanted
36:24 to move away  from any inclination or thinking
36:28 that safety is somehow the first  responsibility of a safety department
36:33 or a safety brother  coming around to check on us.
36:36 We wanted  to put forth more effort
36:39 to teach that safety  is an expression of our spirituality.
36:45 Once we started focusing  on that teaching
36:48 —that there are certain values  such as the sanctity of life,
36:53 we love our brother,
36:55 we must maintain  a good conscience before Jehovah—
36:59 then the whole subject of safety
37:01 became very inspiring to work with.
37:03 It was a real joy.
37:05 In a practical way,  on Sunday afternoon,
37:08 instead of having a three-hour  safety orientation and training,
37:13 we developed a series of videos
37:16 that could be streamed  to volunteers.
37:18 Before they came  (several weeks ahead of time)
37:21 they could watch a video,  take notes,
37:23 and watch it again  if they wanted to.
37:25 And what it did is  it significantly increased the quality
37:30 of our safety orientation and training  for the entire project.
37:34 Enrique Ford.
37:37 We realized that we couldn’t  be paralyzed by fear
37:41 just because we’d never done  something this way before.
37:45 We had to move forward  with faith.
37:46 An example  of that was as a committee
37:49 we made the decision to model  the building in three dimensions
37:54 on a computer  before we started construction.
37:57 Now,  we had never done that before
37:59 —and not to speak of doing it
38:02 on a project of this scale,  complexity, with this deadline—
38:05 but we moved ahead in faith,  and Jehovah blessed that effort.
38:09 We’d like to develop that  a little bit further.
38:12 You’ve given us some examples
38:14 of how Jehovah’s holy spirit  was certainly there,
38:17 his guidance,  and his blessing.
38:20 Could you give us some more  examples of that?
38:22 We’ll start  with Brother Chernish.
38:24 A lot of decisions that were going  to have to be made.
38:27 What could we self-perform?
38:29 What would  we need to outsource
38:32 to get done in four years?
38:35 And we would also come to learn  through this process
38:39 that if we stopped,  if we prayed,
38:41 if we talked about it,  and if we were all in unison,
38:45 we would see  Jehovah’s direction.
38:48 It was  very faith-strengthening,
38:51 and we would see  Jehovah’s spirit
38:53 work upon the contractors  that were working here.
38:55 They would come to us:  “We’ve never swung
38:58 “this many panels  on a building in a day.
39:00 “We did 33 today!
39:02 We’re accustomed  to doing 16!”
39:04 We would chuckle  off on the side.
39:06 We knew what they  were benefiting from.
39:08 Jehovah too  was moving their actions
39:11 because it was his will  and his purpose for this to be done.
39:14 So seeing this level  of blessing and holy spirit
39:17 was really faith-strengthening.
39:19 Troy Snyder.
39:22 Early on, we received a letter  from the Governing Body
39:26 to our committee reminding us
39:28 that although they wanted  the project done in an expedited fashion,
39:32 they didn’t want it done in a way  that hurt the brothers spiritually.
39:36 And so we started  consciously making efforts
39:39 to adjust ones’ schedules
39:41 so that they could attend  their meetings,
39:43 so they could participate  in the field ministry,
39:46 so that they would be able to benefit
39:48 from all the spiritual programs
39:51 that Bethel provides and has for us.
39:53 We were even able to adjust some  of our dear sisters’ schedules
39:57 so that they too could keep up  their spiritual routine.
40:01 And every time we did that,
40:03 it didn’t seem  logical from a human standpoint,
40:05 but the project accelerated.
40:08 Rich Devine.
40:10 Well, I think we’ve prayed  more on this project
40:13 than any other theocratic project  I’ve ever been involved with
40:17 not only as a committee  but every department
40:20 and every crew  would pray together.
40:23 If we talked about work,  we prayed.
40:25 Whether it was technical discussions
40:28 or anything else, we always prayed.
40:30 And it really made us feel that Jehovah  was a part of our daily work
40:33 —that we were really  fellow workers with him—
40:35 and we really felt that.
40:37 But also, I think the most dramatic evidence  of Jehovah’s spirit
40:41 was the manifestation  of the fruitage of the spirit
40:43 in our brothers and sisters.
40:45 Despite long work hours,  hard working conditions,
40:49 difficult living conditions,  an expedited schedule,
40:52 you could still  see the love, the hope,
40:55 and the joy  in the brothers every day.
40:57 And this really  helped me to understand
41:00 how Jehovah’s spirit  was so active here.
41:03 What would you like to say
41:06 to the Bethel family
41:08 and to the thousands of willing,
41:10 hard-working volunteers that came  from the field to assist you?
41:15 Perhaps we can start  with Ken Caughron.
41:18 Well,  many thousands of years ago,
41:21 we remember  the sacrifice of Abel
41:25 because out of love  he gave the best he had.
41:29 So we say “thank you”  to the brothers and sisters
41:33 who supported  the project out in the field
41:35 —out of love giving the best  they had was often their prayers.
41:39 Others came physically,  giving out of love the best they had.
41:44 So may all the brothers  and sisters remember
41:47 that this was the reason  they shared in the project,
41:52 and it is something  that they and Jehovah
41:54 can remember for an eternity.
41:57 Ken Chernish.
42:01 Like Brother Caughron said,
42:03 I would just like  to say “thank you”
42:05 and especially to all  of the brothers and sisters
42:09 in the Bethel complexes  in the U.S. branch territory.
42:13 They treated us like a parent
42:15 would treat a child —so lovingly.
42:19 They gave us everything  we asked for that we needed.
42:23 The friends out in the field,  we’ve talked about them so much.
42:26 They turned their lives upside down
42:29 to come here and work with us.
42:31 Did they benefit?  Absolutely!
42:33 And we so appreciate
42:36 how they put up with us,  how things changed,
42:39 and the schedules that we imputed  upon them to get this work done.
42:43 We know they benefited  as we did,
42:46 and we’d like  to thank them so much.
42:48 Rich Devine.
42:51 Thank you  for sacrificing your money
42:53 and your time  to come and help us.
42:55 Thank you for interviewing  and sending such capable volunteers.
42:58 Thanks for working  in the rain and the snow.
43:01 Thanks for enduring  long bus rides and living in hotels.
43:05 Thanks for being our friends,
43:08 and thanks for the wonderful spirit  that you showed through the whole project.
43:12 Enrique Ford.
43:14 As we had the opportunity  to eat with the volunteers,
43:18 work with them,  and travel with them,
43:20 it became evident  that every one of them
43:23 had a story as  to how they got here.
43:25 Sometimes it was  the supportive mate
43:33 Other times,  they talked about their children
43:36 and how their children  encouraged them
43:39 and supported them so that they could be here.
43:42 There are even  some brothers that told us
43:44 about how  the entire congregation
43:47 supported them financially
43:49 as well as covering  their assignments back home
43:52 because the congregation wanted to sponsor  someone since they couldn’t come.
43:57 So we just want to thank  all of those volunteers
44:01 and the support that made it possible  for them to come.
44:06 Troy Snyder?
44:08 We love you very much.
44:10 And Jehovah united us as a family
44:14 in a period of time to accomplish  something for his glory.
44:17 And I think we personally would love
44:20 to be able to express our appreciation
44:23 and reward each person  for what they’ve done.
44:27 But we take such comfort in knowing  that Jehovah has seen their love,
44:31 has seen their work,  and he will reward them.
44:34 And that will be a rich blessing.
44:36 Thank you  for those heartfelt expressions.
44:41 And in conclusion,  we just have a few brief comments.
44:45 We have heard, and rightfully so,  the Governing Body
44:49 offer warm commendation and appreciation
44:53 to all of you on this committee
44:55 as well as to the thousands  who have supported the project.
44:59 And at this time,
45:01 we’d also like  to take this opportunity
45:04 to thank your wives
45:06 for their hard work  on this project,
45:09 their patience, their endurance,
45:11 and their absolute support that they gave.
45:14 It’s most appreciated.
45:16 And I know you appreciate  their support,
45:18 and we do too.
45:20 So the lessons  that we all learned
45:23 —thanks to you, from this project
45:26 and thanks to Jehovah most of all—
45:28 will benefit us now
45:31 and right on into the future  as your comments have alluded to.
45:34 So once again, thank you for taking the time  to share these observations.
45:39 Thank you for your hard work.
45:41 And it will be a privilege
45:43 for all of us to continue  to work “shoulder to shoulder”
45:46 with “the one who constructed  all things,” Jehovah God.
45:59 There was one word that stood out  in this interview,
46:02 and it was the word “daunting.”
46:05 And, of course,  that is a beautiful word.
46:09 It’s a good word.
46:12 But when you see what was accomplished  in the past four years,
46:17 you’ll see why we’re going to change
46:20 the word “daunting” to “amazing.”
46:24 So lock that one in.
46:27 I mentioned earlier
46:29 that this was  a Governing Body directed project.
46:33 CPC was indeed a unique way
46:36 to expedite the construction.
46:40 However, all that was accomplished  on the Warwick project
46:45 is a result of the base  of experience and, of course,
46:49 all the wonderful training
46:51 that had been laid  for the last several decades
46:55 by the Design/Build Department— that’s DBD.
47:01 They did a lot in planning and executing
47:03 construction projects around the world.
47:06 And the amazing Warwick project
47:10 would not have happened in that time frame
47:13 without the thousands of volunteers,
47:16 many of whom for years tirelessly assisted
47:19 Regional Building Committees —RBC.
47:25 They are sent to them to build so many
47:28 Assembly and Kingdom Halls  month after month.
47:32 And the same is true  of all of the volunteers
47:35 that came and assisted
47:37 with the monumental expansion
47:40 of the Wallkill branch facility.
47:43 Now, would you brothers and sisters like
47:45 to thank all of these ones who supported
47:48 two of the largest construction  projects to date?
48:15 I might mention
48:17 that on Friday,  October 14, 2016,
48:21 a new video  about moving out of Brooklyn
48:24 will be posted  on JW Broadcasting.
48:27 You will find it under  “Latest Videos.”
48:30 At the end of that video,  a letter from the Governing Body is read
48:34 sharing sincere appreciation  for all those who worked
48:39 on these two construction projects.
48:42 It will be posted in English first
48:44 with other languages  being posted at a later time.
48:48 Look for the English edition  on JW Broadcasting
48:51 on October 14, 2016.
48:57 For your further information,
49:01 the CPC was dissolved
49:04 as of September 29, 2016.
49:08 They will all be moving on  to other assignments.
49:12 And we appreciate very much  their intense labor of love.

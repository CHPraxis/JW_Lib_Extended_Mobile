00:00.350 --> 00:02.385
You are probably 


00:02.385 --> 00:06.388
the most obedient group 
of people this size 


00:06.388 --> 00:09.000
that has ever entered Jersey City. 


00:22.805 --> 00:25.708
So we say, 
“Thank you very much


00:25.708 --> 00:28.143
for being in your seats.” 


00:28.143 --> 00:31.480
It’s now my pleasure 
to invite you to stand


00:31.480 --> 00:34.983
and to sing song number 150,


00:34.983 --> 00:39.000
“Reaching Out,”
 Matthew 9:37, 38.


03:33.863 --> 03:38.000
What a marvelous gift from God it is. 


03:40.470 --> 03:42.000
We all have one. 


03:43.773 --> 03:48.711
It’s a bit larger in men than it is in women. 


03:48.712 --> 03:51.047
What is it? 


03:51.047 --> 03:53.315
It’s in your mouth. 


03:53.315 --> 03:56.218
It’s your tongue. 


03:56.218 --> 04:01.256
A small muscle,
a little over three inches long. 


04:01.257 --> 04:03.694
We do so many things with it


04:03.693 --> 04:08.631
—you can whisper with it;
you can yell with it;


04:08.632 --> 04:12.802
you can swallow your food with its help;


04:12.802 --> 04:17.000
and it’s so versatile; 
you can stick it out. 


04:19.542 --> 04:21.777
Over in Tibet, 


04:21.777 --> 04:24.047
they stick out the tongue,
some of them,


04:24.047 --> 04:27.050
and it’s a sign of friendship and greeting. 


04:27.050 --> 04:30.000
Don’t you try that here! 


04:34.223 --> 04:36.725
It stays out of the way of your teeth


04:36.725 --> 04:40.000
when you chew, 
well, most of the time. 


04:43.198 --> 04:45.635
It is an arduous job


04:45.635 --> 04:49.405
trying to control the tongue,


04:49.405 --> 04:51.740
but James had something 
to say about it. 


04:51.740 --> 04:52.975
Let’s see what he had to say.


04:52.975 --> 04:55.345
Let’s turn to James 


04:55.345 --> 04:58.447
in our Bibles or iPads. 


04:58.447 --> 05:01.550
That’s the third chapter of his book,


05:01.550 --> 05:04.820
and we’re going to read 
5 through 10: 


05:04.820 --> 05:09.025
“So, too, the tongue 
is a small part of the body,


05:09.025 --> 05:11.627
“and yet it makes great brags. 


05:11.627 --> 05:13.930
“See how small a fire it takes 


05:13.930 --> 05:16.565
“to set a great forest ablaze! 


05:16.565 --> 05:18.835
“The tongue is also a fire. 


05:18.835 --> 05:21.303
“The tongue represents
a world of unrighteousness


05:21.303 --> 05:23.371
“among our body members,


05:23.372 --> 05:25.742
“for it defiles all the body


05:25.742 --> 05:29.412
“and sets the whole course of life on fire,


05:29.412 --> 05:32.482
“and it is set on fire by Gehenna. 


05:32.482 --> 05:35.919
“For every kind of wild animal and bird


05:35.918 --> 05:39.355
“and reptile and sea creature


05:39.355 --> 05:44.293
“is to be tamed 
and has been tamed by humans. 


05:44.293 --> 05:48.765
“But no human can tame the tongue. 


05:48.765 --> 05:51.700
“It is unruly and injurious, 


05:51.700 --> 05:54.370
“full of deadly poison. 


05:54.370 --> 05:57.607
“With it we praise Jehovah, the Father, 


05:57.607 --> 06:00.544
“and yet with it we curse men 


06:00.543 --> 06:03.078
“who have come into existence 


06:03.078 --> 06:05.648
“‘in the likeness of God.’ 


06:05.648 --> 06:09.518
“Out of the same mouth


06:09.518 --> 06:12.000
come blessing and cursing.”


06:13.622 --> 06:15.659
In our imperfect state, 


06:15.658 --> 06:19.495
we can’t completely control it. 


06:19.495 --> 06:21.697
Oh, we try, 
and we must try,


06:21.697 --> 06:25.569
but we just can’t get the job
completely done. 


06:25.568 --> 06:28.303
But we’re not going to give up. 


06:28.303 --> 06:31.140
We’re going to keep trying. 


06:31.140 --> 06:33.575
We’re going to watch, though,
what we have to say


06:33.575 --> 06:37.380
—what comes out of the mouth,
what rolls as a result of the tongue. 


06:37.380 --> 06:39.515
We’re going to be very careful. 


06:39.515 --> 06:42.385
And we know that we must rein in


06:42.385 --> 06:44.887
a runaway tongue 


06:44.887 --> 06:47.390
and curb its wagging. 


06:47.390 --> 06:51.193
Although blessing 
and cursing can come out


06:51.193 --> 06:54.496
of the mouth by use of the tongue


06:54.497 --> 06:59.335
you will only hear blessings
out of the mouths


06:59.335 --> 07:03.005
of the speakers 
and participants today. 


07:03.005 --> 07:07.710
These Christians 
have bridled their tongues. 


07:07.710 --> 07:11.000
Thank God for that. 


07:12.448 --> 07:15.951
Today we are going to 
consider things that are—


07:15.952 --> 07:17.987
Now, you want to jot these down


07:17.987 --> 07:21.624
because we’re going to mention them 
several times through the day. 


07:21.623 --> 07:24.426
Here they are: 


07:24.427 --> 07:26.529
‘true,


07:26.528 --> 07:29.298
‘things of serious concern, 


07:29.298 --> 07:31.866
‘righteous, chaste, 


07:31.867 --> 07:35.204
‘lovable, well-spoken-of,


07:35.203 --> 07:38.340
virtuous, praiseworthy,’


07:38.340 --> 07:42.000
“good and acceptable.” 


07:43.512 --> 07:48.150
The tongue will work good 
for us today, not bad. 


07:48.150 --> 07:50.887
So we say, “sit still,” 


07:50.887 --> 07:53.089
and may your ears 


07:53.088 --> 07:56.225
keep up with the tongues 


07:56.225 --> 08:00.930
of all of our participants.


08:00.930 --> 08:02.965
And as you know,


08:02.965 --> 08:06.835
in our September JW Broadcasting program,


08:06.835 --> 08:11.507
Brother Splane told us 
that the move of Bethel family members


08:11.507 --> 08:13.542
to the world headquarters facility 


08:13.542 --> 08:17.112
in Warwick, New York, 
is in progress. 


08:17.112 --> 08:20.984
It is already a bustling complex 


08:20.983 --> 08:23.351
with so many relocated 


08:23.352 --> 08:26.822
and caring for their assignments. 


08:26.822 --> 08:30.425
This represents a historic change 


08:30.425 --> 08:33.930
since the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


08:33.930 --> 08:38.467
had been located in Brooklyn, New York,


08:38.467 --> 08:43.000
for over 100 years. 


08:45.207 --> 08:47.244
We’re all happy, 


08:47.243 --> 08:50.580
and it’s good for us who live there. 


08:50.580 --> 08:53.348
It’s such a beautiful place indeed 


08:53.348 --> 08:55.851
and so restful. 


08:55.852 --> 08:58.989
All of us feel like we have been able 


08:58.988 --> 09:02.000
to add years to our lives. 


09:04.360 --> 09:07.363
We can hear birds sing, 


09:07.363 --> 09:11.666
crickets at night, frogs


09:11.667 --> 09:14.000
—every now and then, 
there’s an eagle that flies over—


09:15.905 --> 09:19.775
bears, and snakes. 


09:19.775 --> 09:22.645
But we’ve been warned to watch out. 


09:22.645 --> 09:24.713
We know what to do. 


09:24.713 --> 09:27.115
And we’re just enjoying ourselves 


09:27.115 --> 09:30.000
as much as we possibly can. 


09:31.053 --> 09:34.490
Well, we now invite you 


09:34.490 --> 09:36.858
to enjoy a video presentation 


09:36.858 --> 09:39.961
about the history 
of headquarters in Brooklyn


09:39.962 --> 09:42.164
and the move to Warwick. 


09:42.163 --> 09:45.768
So we say, 
“Enjoy what you see.” 


09:45.768 --> 09:47.803
And here is


09:47.803 --> 09:49.805
—look at your notes—


09:49.805 --> 09:52.000
true.


09:59.282 --> 10:04.000
Why are we here at Bethel today 
in New York City? 


10:05.120 --> 10:08.457
Why did Pastor Russell leave Pittsburgh? 


10:08.457 --> 10:11.000
To expand the ministry worldwide. 


10:12.762 --> 10:15.197
But look at it today. 


10:15.197 --> 10:17.634
The satisfaction to see 


10:17.633 --> 10:22.236
and the blessing of seeing the work 
expand “to the ends of the earth” 


10:22.237 --> 10:24.674
and God’s will being done.


10:24.673 --> 10:28.243
In 1909, 
Jehovah led his people 


10:28.243 --> 10:30.011
in making a move that would become 


10:30.012 --> 10:33.349
an indelible part of our spiritual heritage. 


10:33.348 --> 10:35.550
For years, 
the Pennsylvania location 


10:35.550 --> 10:38.553
had been adequate for the work 
of spreading the good news. 


10:38.553 --> 10:43.691
But as time went on, 
challenges arose.


10:43.692 --> 10:47.397
Pittsburgh’s reputation 
was one of steel and industry,


10:47.397 --> 10:49.599
not really one of religion and faith. 


10:49.598 --> 10:53.468
The organization at that time was trying 
to get the preaching work accomplished,


10:53.468 --> 10:58.006
and it wasn’t really 
well-suited in Pittsburgh. 


10:58.007 --> 11:02.579
So they struggled to find a city
that would work for them,


11:02.578 --> 11:05.380
and one of the cities 
that they came across was Brooklyn.


11:05.380 --> 11:09.185
It was very famous 
for its pastors and its churches. 


11:09.185 --> 11:11.187
It was actually nicknamed 
“The City of Churches,”


11:11.187 --> 11:13.222
and that was a good reputation 


11:13.222 --> 11:15.190
to springboard the preaching work from. 


11:15.190 --> 11:18.993
They were trying to preach 
the good news to the entire earth,


11:18.993 --> 11:23.365
but with so few Bible Students, 
how could they possibly do it? 


11:23.365 --> 11:26.402
And then they realized the cultural base 


11:26.402 --> 11:29.139
that existed in New York City was broad,


11:29.138 --> 11:32.875
and so they felt that
this put them in the perfect position 


11:32.875 --> 11:35.210
to preach to people


11:35.210 --> 11:39.282
and have them help the Bible Students 
take the message back to their homelands. 


11:39.282 --> 11:43.552
Brooklyn, just far and above, 
was the obvious choice to them.


11:43.552 --> 11:45.722
Officially, Brooklyn Bethel 


11:45.722 --> 11:49.592
opened its doors in April 1909.


11:49.592 --> 11:52.795
These were years 
of tremendous activity


11:52.795 --> 11:54.997
leading up to 1914. 


11:54.997 --> 11:57.000
They also proved 
to be times of test. 


12:01.703 --> 12:05.273
The United States 
had declared war on Germany. 


12:05.273 --> 12:08.210
From March through July of 1918, 


12:08.210 --> 12:11.280
eight different brothers 
who were taking the lead at that time


12:11.280 --> 12:15.383
were arrested, sentenced, 
and taken off 


12:15.383 --> 12:17.586
to a federal penitentiary.


12:17.587 --> 12:20.589
The Executive Committee at headquarters 


12:20.588 --> 12:22.591
consulted with other brothers.


12:22.592 --> 12:25.360
It was decided to sell 
the Brooklyn Tabernacle 


12:25.360 --> 12:28.563
and to close the Bethel home.


12:28.563 --> 12:31.533
So we moved here in 1909, 


12:31.533 --> 12:36.571
and within ten years, 
Brooklyn Bethel was closed. 


12:36.572 --> 12:41.977
The headquarters operations 
were moved back to Pittsburgh. 


12:41.977 --> 12:44.079
In the year 1919, 


12:44.078 --> 12:46.748
when the brothers 
were finally released from prison,


12:46.748 --> 12:50.185
Brother Rutherford apprehended rapidly:


12:50.185 --> 12:53.055
‘There’s still great interest in the work,


12:53.055 --> 12:56.525
‘and Jehovah is still blessing 
and backing us. 


12:56.525 --> 12:59.162
‘We need to get back, organize it, and get on 


12:59.162 --> 13:01.897
with the work that has been started.’


13:01.897 --> 13:05.034
So should they start from scratch 


13:05.033 --> 13:08.570
and build a Bethel there in Allegheny, 
or should they utilize


13:08.570 --> 13:11.073
the property that they 
already owned in Brooklyn? 


13:11.073 --> 13:13.908
They wanted to see if that 
was actually Jehovah’s will. 


13:13.908 --> 13:17.513
So, what Judge Rutherford 
did is he asked 


13:17.513 --> 13:19.981
Brother C. A. Wise, 
who was his vice president,


13:19.982 --> 13:24.920
‘We need to do a test to see if Jehovah 
is going to bless this direction.’ 


13:24.920 --> 13:28.623
During wartime, 
any raw materials


13:28.623 --> 13:31.760
—paper, fuel, all of those things—
are regulated


13:31.760 --> 13:34.997
because the war effort is going on. 


13:34.997 --> 13:36.999
So this was a perfect test to see 


13:36.998 --> 13:39.435
if it would enable 
the brothers to get coal. 


13:39.435 --> 13:42.905
He sent him back here, 
and he said: ‘Don’t just get a little coal. 


13:42.905 --> 13:46.008
‘Get enough so that it is obvious 


13:46.008 --> 13:49.445
that if we get this coal, 
it is only by Jehovah’s blessing.’


13:49.445 --> 13:52.515
Brother Rutherford directed Brother Wise 


13:52.515 --> 13:54.950
to order 500 tons of coal. 


13:54.950 --> 13:57.152
And what was the outcome? 


13:57.152 --> 13:58.720
When he applied to the authorities,


13:58.720 --> 14:03.725
he was granted a certificate 
to obtain 500 tons of coal


14:03.725 --> 14:07.697
—enough to care for their needs 
for years to come.


14:07.697 --> 14:11.034
So in 1919
—September, I believe—


14:11.033 --> 14:16.438
is when they actually moved back 
from Allegheny to Brooklyn.


14:16.438 --> 14:18.606
Once it was determined 
that Brooklyn, New York,


14:18.607 --> 14:20.775
would be the new world headquarters,


14:20.775 --> 14:23.378
how would Jehovah use this new location 


14:23.378 --> 14:25.546
to advance the preaching work?


14:25.547 --> 14:30.285
Well, we were dependent back then 
on commercial printeries.


14:30.285 --> 14:32.287
Brother Rutherford wondered whether


14:32.287 --> 14:36.092
we could 
print The Watchtower ourselves.


14:36.092 --> 14:40.195
And so a printing press was obtained,
and a printery was set up. 


14:40.195 --> 14:44.333
And in time, the book printing began. 


14:44.333 --> 14:48.703
Outside commercial companies thought 
that we would never be capable


14:48.703 --> 14:53.141
of printing and binding books. 


14:53.142 --> 14:57.145
But the brothers applied themselves, learned,


14:57.145 --> 15:01.000
and with the support of the Lord,
they got it going.


15:02.150 --> 15:04.687
It was so evident 
that Jehovah was using Brooklyn Bethel. 


15:04.687 --> 15:09.359
All the printing and binding 
was done for the world 


15:09.358 --> 15:11.893
here in Brooklyn.


15:11.893 --> 15:13.928
After that,


15:13.928 --> 15:17.833
the organization took in brothers, 
under the direction of the Governing Body,


15:17.833 --> 15:22.370
to come and learn what they could 
in Brooklyn and take it with them 


15:22.370 --> 15:25.942
back to their countries
and see what they could do 


15:25.942 --> 15:29.379
about lightening the load a little 
as far as the printing


15:29.378 --> 15:33.000
and distribution was concerned.


15:39.422 --> 15:42.524
Soon after I got to Bethel in Japan, 


15:42.523 --> 15:44.660
I worked on the web press. 


15:44.660 --> 15:49.130
We always looked up to Brooklyn 
as our “big brother,”


15:49.130 --> 15:51.433
and we always looked 
to them for direction. 


15:51.433 --> 15:55.103
Anytime we were able to come back
to the United States on a brief visit,


15:55.103 --> 15:56.938
I would always make sure


15:56.938 --> 15:59.341
to see what was new 
and to talk with the brothers. 


15:59.342 --> 16:02.010
And the brothers 
were always very helpful.


16:02.010 --> 16:05.380
So you saw how Jehovah used


16:05.380 --> 16:09.150
this place to get the spiritual food out 


16:09.150 --> 16:12.120
to the worldwide association of the brothers.


16:12.120 --> 16:15.723
It is clear that Jehovah 
had blessed the advancement


16:15.723 --> 16:18.726
of the printing and distribution work 
in Brooklyn Bethel. 


16:18.727 --> 16:21.464
But to further share the truth globally 


16:21.463 --> 16:24.131
in a way that would truly touch hearts,


16:24.132 --> 16:26.935
other challenges needed to be addressed.


16:26.935 --> 16:31.207
Zechariah 8:23 says


16:31.207 --> 16:34.977
that ‘ten men out of all the languages 
of the nations


16:34.977 --> 16:38.180
will grab hold of the skirt 
of a man who is a Jew.’ 


16:38.180 --> 16:40.882
Now, that’s a lot of languages. 


16:40.882 --> 16:44.554
But for every person 


16:44.553 --> 16:46.721
to understand,


16:46.722 --> 16:49.000
they have to hear it in their language.


16:50.925 --> 16:52.928
Though we were translating


16:52.928 --> 16:56.698
into many languages, many of these 
were not simultaneous with English. 


16:56.698 --> 16:59.000
Some of them 
lagged behind for many months. 


17:01.002 --> 17:03.639
And, of course, 
there were many languages


17:03.638 --> 17:06.341
that didn’t have 
any literature at all.


17:06.342 --> 17:10.612
And so the Governing Body 
saw the situation,


17:10.612 --> 17:12.849
and they created the department
Translation Services. 


17:12.848 --> 17:15.016
Some of the early languages


17:15.017 --> 17:18.000
were translated right here in Brooklyn. 


17:19.087 --> 17:21.924
Eventually, translation work was moved out


17:21.923 --> 17:25.060
to the branches 
where they speak those languages.


17:25.060 --> 17:28.330
The 20th century saw 
many technological advancements. 


17:28.330 --> 17:30.832
How did Jehovah guide his servants 


17:30.832 --> 17:33.602
at Brooklyn Bethel to make progressive use


17:33.602 --> 17:37.239
of these advancements 
to further the preaching work


17:37.238 --> 17:39.240
to “all the languages of the nations”?


17:39.240 --> 17:41.110
Well, the challenges 


17:41.110 --> 17:43.112
of developing a computer 


17:43.112 --> 17:47.282
that could actually type and compose 
in all of those languages 


17:47.282 --> 17:50.819
were enormous 
in the late seventies and early eighties. 


17:50.818 --> 17:54.590
I think the brothers could see 
that technology was changing. 


17:54.590 --> 17:58.560
Things were changing 
from letterpress to offset printing; 


17:58.560 --> 18:00.928
things were going from black and white


18:00.928 --> 18:03.098
to color. 


18:03.098 --> 18:05.100
So I think all the pieces began to be there 


18:05.100 --> 18:07.735
to look at the idea of MEPS. 


18:07.735 --> 18:11.107
I kind of liken it to our “moon shot.” 


18:11.107 --> 18:14.375
In other words, 
can you get there and back? 


18:14.375 --> 18:18.047
Jehovah provided the right people 
at the right time


18:18.047 --> 18:22.284
—people who had previous expertise 
with building computer systems 


18:22.283 --> 18:25.120
and people who had some expertise 
with languages. 


18:25.120 --> 18:27.122
And what has always fascinated me 


18:27.122 --> 18:32.000
is Jehovah’s use of the timing 
of when to use the technologies.


18:36.365 --> 18:40.002
Jehovah put Bethel in Brooklyn. 


18:40.002 --> 18:43.705
And he would know at any given time


18:43.705 --> 18:47.977
—strategically and geographically—
where would be the best place


18:47.977 --> 18:52.214
for his world headquarters, 
and for decades,


18:52.213 --> 18:54.916
it was Brooklyn.


18:54.917 --> 18:58.820
In 1971, when you looked out 
over the East River,


18:58.820 --> 19:01.757
you know what you saw along the shoreline? 


19:01.757 --> 19:04.694
A whole row of freighters. 


19:04.693 --> 19:08.730
And then the fact that we had 
our printery just a few blocks away, 


19:08.730 --> 19:13.102
revealed why it was beneficial 
to have Bethel here in Brooklyn. 


19:13.102 --> 19:16.239
Now, you look out over the East River, 
what do you see? 


19:16.238 --> 19:18.240
It’s a park. 


19:18.240 --> 19:20.575
You have swimming pools there; 
it’s full of people. 


19:20.575 --> 19:22.677
The purpose has changed, 


19:22.677 --> 19:27.000
and the reasons for our being here 
have in many ways disappeared.


19:29.183 --> 19:31.753
Because of the way things 
are developing in the world


19:31.753 --> 19:35.356
and because of Brooklyn 
in New York City 


19:35.357 --> 19:38.060
being where it is in the world scene,


19:38.060 --> 19:42.197
it’s time for us to get things 
moved out of Brooklyn


19:42.197 --> 19:45.800
and to a new world headquarters 
where we can be even more fruitful.


19:45.800 --> 19:47.802
In 2011, 


19:47.802 --> 19:51.172
Jehovah was again leading his people 


19:51.172 --> 19:53.709
in another historic move.


19:53.708 --> 19:56.945
We’d like to let you know 
that the Governing Body has decided 


19:56.945 --> 20:01.917
that if the approvals are received 
for the Warwick project,


20:01.917 --> 20:05.887
we will be moving 
completely out of Brooklyn. 


20:05.887 --> 20:10.592
The world headquarters 
will be relocated at Warwick.


20:10.592 --> 20:13.995
When it was announced, 
the plans of establishing world headquarters


20:13.995 --> 20:16.063
in what is going to be in Warwick, 


20:16.063 --> 20:18.433
it just seemed like it was so far away. 


20:18.433 --> 20:20.335
We may not even live to that. 


20:20.335 --> 20:23.172
But the time has passed quite quickly,


20:23.172 --> 20:26.909
and now it’s virtually on our doorstep. 


20:26.908 --> 20:28.910
It’s happening!


20:28.910 --> 20:31.247
We have seen 
that Jehovah 


20:31.247 --> 20:34.182
can use any location. 


20:34.182 --> 20:36.319
We have beautiful facilities now 


20:36.318 --> 20:38.820
at Wallkill, Patterson, soon Warwick


20:38.820 --> 20:40.822
—beautiful facilities 


20:40.822 --> 20:44.159
that Jehovah will use
to the full just as he used Brooklyn.


20:44.158 --> 20:46.295
And it becomes so evident


20:46.295 --> 20:48.597
that this is not an organization of men. 


20:48.597 --> 20:52.034
We’re not dedicated 
to a building or to a city; 


20:52.033 --> 20:54.035
we are dedicated to Jehovah. 


20:54.035 --> 20:56.170
And when you sense his direction


20:56.170 --> 20:59.173
in this matter of relocating


20:59.173 --> 21:03.111
and doing things differently,
you can’t help but—


21:03.112 --> 21:05.214
OK, we back off the sentimentality,


21:05.213 --> 21:07.215
and let’s go ahead and do the work 


21:07.215 --> 21:09.450
as Jehovah has outlined for us today.


21:09.450 --> 21:11.953
I’ve always concluded 
that when it works, 


21:11.953 --> 21:14.255
Jehovah is behind it. 


21:14.255 --> 21:18.027
So Warwick worked beautifully. 


21:18.027 --> 21:21.129
And if you ever get to Warwick 
and you see 


21:21.128 --> 21:23.165
Warwick as it is now,
you’ll say, 


21:23.165 --> 21:26.000
“This is the place
that Jehovah wanted us to be.”


21:27.302 --> 21:29.872
Jehovah had Brooklyn in place, 


21:29.872 --> 21:33.009
some parts of it for over a hundred years. 


21:33.008 --> 21:37.245
And it served so well 
as a base for the Governing Body,


21:37.245 --> 21:42.000
as a base for printing and providing 
spiritual food worldwide,


21:43.118 --> 21:45.153
as a base for direction 


21:45.153 --> 21:48.756
for congregations worldwide,


21:48.757 --> 21:51.025
and now Jehovah 
has something else in mind. 


21:51.025 --> 21:54.495
With the way things turned out,


21:54.495 --> 21:58.467
it wasn’t a man or a group of men 


21:58.467 --> 22:00.502
who back in the early 1900’s said: 


22:00.502 --> 22:02.504
“You know what we need to do? 


22:02.503 --> 22:04.505
“We’ll stay here about a hundred years. 


22:04.505 --> 22:07.842
“And then we’ll have a place 
up north of the city


22:07.842 --> 22:11.079
“and we’ll move there 
and we’ll sell all these buildings


22:11.078 --> 22:13.448
and then it’ll be 
a real boost to the work.” 


22:13.448 --> 22:16.216
No man or a group of men did that. 


22:16.217 --> 22:18.254
But Jehovah and Christ Jesus


22:18.253 --> 22:20.288
—they direct the brothers 


22:20.288 --> 22:24.258
at the right time in the right place 
to make the decisions 


22:24.258 --> 22:27.061
that may seem for the present, 
just for the present. 


22:27.062 --> 22:29.765
But Jehovah sees the end 


22:29.765 --> 22:31.767
from the very beginning.


22:31.767 --> 22:34.469
Yes, world headquarters in Brooklyn 


22:34.468 --> 22:37.371
has been the hub of our global preaching work 


22:37.372 --> 22:39.440
throughout the 20th century. 


22:39.440 --> 22:41.308
Despite many twists and turns,


22:41.308 --> 22:43.745
Jehovah has used this location 


22:43.745 --> 22:47.082
to advance his will in unprecedented ways. 


22:47.082 --> 22:51.252
While we think back fondly 
on all that was accomplished here, 


22:51.252 --> 22:55.000
we know going forward, 
there is only more to come.


23:59.020 --> 24:01.022
That was most interesting. 


24:01.022 --> 24:04.392
But save your hands; 
there’s more coming. 


24:04.392 --> 24:07.495
So we’re not looking back on Brooklyn, 


24:07.495 --> 24:10.432
but we are moving forward


24:10.432 --> 24:15.004
—one step closer to our future hope. 


24:15.003 --> 24:17.038
And as you know,


24:17.038 --> 24:22.776
I just love acronyms and abbreviations


24:22.777 --> 24:25.114
—PC, WC,


24:25.113 --> 24:30.085
WDC, LDC—


24:30.085 --> 24:34.788
but what does CPC stand for? 


24:34.788 --> 24:38.726
Well, in the video just seen,


24:38.727 --> 24:43.130
you got a glimpse 
of the beautiful new little city 


24:43.130 --> 24:45.633
built on a lake in Warwick. 


24:45.633 --> 24:50.005
So the CPC helped make that happen. 


24:50.005 --> 24:54.877
What does the CPC stand for? 


24:54.877 --> 24:59.747
CPC stands for 
Construction Project Committee. 


24:59.747 --> 25:02.284
Lock that in. 


25:02.283 --> 25:05.953
Though that committee 
lived and breathed 


25:05.953 --> 25:09.056
the Warwick project 
for a number of years, 


25:09.057 --> 25:13.595
it was really 
a Governing Body directed project. 


25:13.595 --> 25:16.698
However, 
the Construction Project Committee 


25:16.698 --> 25:19.333
was given the latitude 
to make many 


25:19.333 --> 25:23.003
of the detail-oriented decisions 


25:23.003 --> 25:25.273
on their own. 


25:25.273 --> 25:29.010
Now, how did this assignment 
affect these brothers? 


25:29.010 --> 25:31.747
Did they give it 


25:31.747 --> 25:34.000
serious concern? 


25:35.617 --> 25:39.520
Let’s pay attention 
to a prerecorded interview 


25:39.520 --> 25:41.690
of the CPC 


25:41.690 --> 25:46.293
conducted by
Brother Harold Corkern,


25:46.293 --> 25:49.830
a helper for the Publishing Committee 
of the Governing Body. 


25:49.830 --> 25:53.000
The video is entitled


25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Building for the Future.


25:57.272 --> 25:59.840
The construction 
of the new world headquarters 


25:59.840 --> 26:04.245
at Warwick, New York,
was indeed a historic project. 


26:04.245 --> 26:07.648
The Construction Project Committee 
certainly saw evidence


26:07.648 --> 26:10.485
of Jehovah’s blessing 
and guidance upon them. 


26:10.485 --> 26:12.520
But they also realized 


26:12.520 --> 26:16.592
that he was building 
more than just a new facility;


26:16.592 --> 26:19.660
he was building qualities 


26:19.660 --> 26:22.630
that are so necessary 
for his people. 


26:22.630 --> 26:26.635
And this we’ll see as we talk 
to our CPC members.


26:26.635 --> 26:28.837
At this time, 
it would be good for us


26:28.837 --> 26:31.572
to introduce 
the Construction Project Committee. 


26:31.572 --> 26:33.609
We’ll do so alphabetically. 


26:33.608 --> 26:36.476
We have 
Brother Ken Caughron,


26:36.477 --> 26:38.145
Brother Kenneth Chernish, 


26:38.145 --> 26:40.248
Brother Richard Devine, 


26:40.248 --> 26:42.116
Brother Enrique Ford, and 


26:42.117 --> 26:43.985
Brother Troy Snyder. 


26:43.985 --> 26:47.588
One of the first questions 
we’d like to ask you is:


26:47.588 --> 26:49.823
When you first got this assignment 


26:49.823 --> 26:52.993
and you learned of the scope 


26:52.993 --> 26:55.063
and all the work that was involved 


26:55.063 --> 26:57.665
and the established completion date,


26:57.665 --> 27:00.502
what was your first reaction? 


27:00.502 --> 27:03.439
And we’ll start with 
Brother Richard Devine.


27:03.438 --> 27:06.741
Well, I was excited 
but overwhelmed


27:06.742 --> 27:09.010
—overwhelmed not just 
by the size of the project 


27:09.010 --> 27:11.012
and the expedited schedule


27:11.012 --> 27:13.114
but especially by the level of trust 


27:13.113 --> 27:15.616
that the Governing Body 
had put in the five of us. 


27:15.617 --> 27:17.852
I was used to recommendations 
being reviewed 


27:17.852 --> 27:19.854
by multiple layers of oversight 


27:19.853 --> 27:23.625
and decisions taking weeks 
or months to arrive at. 


27:23.625 --> 27:25.727
And here the Governing Body told us 


27:25.727 --> 27:28.295
that we were to report only 
to the Publishing Committee. 


27:28.295 --> 27:30.465
And once a budget was established,


27:30.465 --> 27:33.233
to use our best judgment, 
carry out the work, 


27:33.233 --> 27:37.538
and come back to them for direction 
only if we exceeded our budget.


27:37.538 --> 27:40.541
Brother Troy Snyder,
what would you like to add?


27:40.542 --> 27:44.445
The emotions varied 
from being scared to excited. 


27:44.445 --> 27:47.148
And like any new assignment,
you think about how much work 


27:47.148 --> 27:49.450
is going to be needed to accomplish it. 


27:49.450 --> 27:52.553
But then when really meditating 
on the scope of the job 


27:52.553 --> 27:55.990
and the time frame that was desired, 


27:55.990 --> 27:58.025
you started to feel inadequate, 


27:58.025 --> 28:00.962
and there was just no way 
you could do it. 


28:00.962 --> 28:03.765
But then you started to realize 
that Jehovah was behind you. 


28:03.765 --> 28:06.667
He was the one 
who was directing matters. 


28:06.667 --> 28:08.870
He had confidence that we could do it. 


28:08.870 --> 28:11.438
And so as a result, 
you knew you could really lean on him 


28:11.438 --> 28:13.206
and look at him as a fellow worker. 


28:13.207 --> 28:15.877
And that really helped set the pace.


28:15.877 --> 28:17.812
Brother Ford.


28:17.812 --> 28:19.747
The first thing I realized is


28:19.747 --> 28:22.417
that if this project 
was going to be successful,


28:22.417 --> 28:25.754
it was going to be 
because of Jehovah’s holy spirit. 


28:25.753 --> 28:29.823
That was clear because 
from a human perspective


28:29.823 --> 28:31.860
it was literally impossible, 


28:31.860 --> 28:34.562
but it was what Jehovah 
had asked us to do. 


28:34.562 --> 28:37.699
And the other thing 
that occurred to me 


28:37.698 --> 28:40.101
was that Jehovah 
wasn’t going to bless 


28:40.102 --> 28:43.237
our standard approach 
of developing projects.


28:43.237 --> 28:45.607
Brother Ken Caughron?


28:45.607 --> 28:50.279
We were living and working 
on the Nigeria branch construction project 


28:50.278 --> 28:54.181
at Igieduma out 
in the beautiful African bush. 


28:54.182 --> 28:56.450
So my first feeling was, 


28:56.450 --> 28:58.820
‘Did they dial the wrong number?’ 


28:58.820 --> 29:02.590
But within 30 minutes, 
we returned the phone call. 


29:02.590 --> 29:06.193
We were very happy 
to accept the privilege to go. 


29:06.193 --> 29:08.530
As far as a completion date,


29:08.530 --> 29:11.867
if we would have known 
all the details at that time 


29:11.867 --> 29:14.235
of how Warwick 
would be constructed, 


29:14.235 --> 29:16.403
where would 
the faith have been? 


29:16.403 --> 29:19.040
So it wasn’t our assignment 


29:19.040 --> 29:21.042
at that time to know all the details. 


29:21.042 --> 29:23.512
It was our assignment to have faith 


29:23.512 --> 29:26.014
in the invisible One, Jehovah,


29:26.013 --> 29:29.250
and move forward 
with that conviction.


29:29.250 --> 29:32.087
Brother Ken Chernish, 
what would you like to add?


29:32.087 --> 29:34.522
I could not believe 


29:34.522 --> 29:38.125
that Jehovah would put 
that much trust in me. 


29:38.125 --> 29:40.728
I’ll never forget 
going to bed that night, 


29:40.728 --> 29:43.296
laying down, eyes wide open


29:43.297 --> 29:46.300
—they remained open all night long—


29:46.300 --> 29:48.335
just praying to Jehovah. 


29:48.335 --> 29:50.772
We didn’t have 
construction documents. 


29:50.772 --> 29:52.707
We didn’t have permits. 


29:52.707 --> 29:55.277
We didn’t even have design 
on some of the buildings. 


29:55.277 --> 29:58.647
From a secular perspective, 
it couldn’t be done in four years. 


29:58.647 --> 30:02.217
And I realized I just needed 
to have the faith 


30:02.217 --> 30:05.487
to follow Jehovah’s lead and 
to work with these brothers 


30:05.487 --> 30:07.955
and that schedule 
would become attainable.


30:07.955 --> 30:11.960
When you first started working 
as a committee, 


30:11.960 --> 30:14.595
were there any challenges 


30:14.595 --> 30:16.898
on learning how 
to work together as a committee? 


30:16.898 --> 30:20.401
And if so, 
how did you address them? 


30:20.402 --> 30:22.604
And we’ll start 
with Brother Ford.


30:22.603 --> 30:25.640
I remember a visit from one 
Governing Body member, 


30:25.640 --> 30:27.675
and he made the statement 


30:27.675 --> 30:31.312
that they wanted 
this not to be a Bethel project, 


30:31.312 --> 30:35.417
not to be an RBC project, 
but to be a CPC project


30:35.417 --> 30:37.419
—a totally different approach. 


30:37.418 --> 30:40.888
So that assured me 
that the Governing Body 


30:40.888 --> 30:44.158
deliberately wanted us 
to blend together 


30:44.158 --> 30:47.295
these five different 
approaches and personalities.


30:47.295 --> 30:49.497
Brother Richard Devine?


30:49.497 --> 30:51.399
We all brought different 
paradigms to the table, 


30:51.398 --> 30:54.668
different ways of thinking, 
even a different language in some cases. 


30:54.668 --> 30:58.238
And so it took a while for us 
to understand each other. 


30:58.238 --> 31:01.708
And so we, early on, 
decided to try to take advantage 


31:01.708 --> 31:03.978
of everything 
that the brotherhood could offer 


31:03.978 --> 31:08.081
and try to blend the different approaches 
to achieve the success 


31:08.082 --> 31:11.052
that, really, we were hoping for 
with Jehovah’s blessing. 


31:11.052 --> 31:14.989
And as time went on, 
we really began to respect each other 


31:14.988 --> 31:19.060
and draw close together 
as a committee and as friends.


31:19.060 --> 31:20.995
What I appreciated 
was in our meetings, 


31:20.995 --> 31:23.798
the brothers felt comfortable 
expressing themselves 


31:23.798 --> 31:27.068
and their viewpoints 
even if it differed from others.


31:27.068 --> 31:30.238
My challenge was lack 
of Bethel experience


31:30.238 --> 31:32.240
—still is. 


31:32.240 --> 31:35.810
Yet, these brothers 
were so patient with me, 


31:35.810 --> 31:40.348
so protective of me, even, 
and in caring for me, 


31:40.348 --> 31:43.450
in understanding how much different 
my background was, 


31:43.450 --> 31:47.155
the way I went about making decisions, 
the way I expressed myself. 


31:47.155 --> 31:49.157
Yet, they understood that. 


31:49.157 --> 31:51.225
I also prayed to show honor 


31:51.225 --> 31:53.427
to these brothers and to take the lead. 


31:53.427 --> 31:56.397
I did a good job of it sometimes 
and not so good at other times. 


31:56.397 --> 31:59.034
But I have 
really tried to rely on Jehovah 


31:59.033 --> 32:01.035
in that way 
to overcome the challenge.


32:01.035 --> 32:04.638
The biggest challenge 
for me was myself. 


32:04.638 --> 32:06.806
I could quickly see 


32:06.807 --> 32:09.377
why Jehovah had brought 
the other brothers together 


32:09.377 --> 32:12.047
with their experience 
in construction, 


32:12.047 --> 32:15.650
in engineering, 
in business administration, 


32:15.650 --> 32:17.785
and many years 
at world headquarters. 


32:17.785 --> 32:21.788
But I felt apprehensive 
about my experience 


32:21.788 --> 32:25.793
and even hesitant sometimes 
to express myself. 


32:25.793 --> 32:28.595
But I kept up 
my spiritual routines


32:28.595 --> 32:31.967
—field service, prayer, 
meditation, and so forth. 


32:31.967 --> 32:34.302
And in time, 
I realized that I needed 


32:34.302 --> 32:36.304
to show more personal faith


32:36.303 --> 32:38.906
—well, specifically to show more faith


32:38.907 --> 32:42.777
in not comparing ourselves to others 


32:42.777 --> 32:45.012
and not neglecting the gifts 


32:45.012 --> 32:47.682
that we do have to offer to Jehovah. 


32:47.682 --> 32:50.819
So I benefited from every brother 
on the committee. 


32:50.818 --> 32:53.520
I’m refined, 
and I’m very thankful 


32:53.520 --> 32:55.523
to Jehovah for helping me grow.


32:55.523 --> 32:58.391
It’s very commendable, 
a good example for us. 


32:58.392 --> 33:00.862
Our next question: 


33:00.862 --> 33:03.364
Given the magnitude 


33:03.363 --> 33:05.833
of this project 


33:05.833 --> 33:10.438
and the date 
that was established for completion, 


33:10.438 --> 33:15.275
what organizational 
and logistical challenges 


33:15.275 --> 33:19.080
did you find most daunting? 


33:19.080 --> 33:21.148
Brother Devine?


33:21.148 --> 33:23.216
At our peak, 
we were processing 


33:23.217 --> 33:25.887
over 11,000 requisition lines a month. 


33:25.887 --> 33:30.525
We were delivering 
over 1,000 pallets a week to the site. 


33:30.525 --> 33:32.793
It was an incredible challenge. 


33:32.793 --> 33:36.130
And it really would have been impossible 
without Jehovah’s blessing 


33:36.130 --> 33:40.902
and the hard work of our 
Procurement and Purchasing Departments.


33:40.902 --> 33:45.105
Designers, by their training and background, 
are used to planning. 


33:45.105 --> 33:47.508
They’re used to starting a project 


33:47.508 --> 33:50.176
with the determination 
of how long it would take 


33:50.177 --> 33:53.815
to get the design finished 
and then scheduling forward. 


33:53.815 --> 33:55.850
So from day one, 


33:55.850 --> 33:58.000
I realized 
that if we could not find a way 


34:00.822 --> 34:04.992
completed very quickly and on time, 
the project would grind to a halt. 


34:04.992 --> 34:07.027
So that was very daunting for me.


34:07.027 --> 34:10.465
At that time, the Wallkill project 
was still in full swing. 


34:10.465 --> 34:13.868
And they were feeding us 
volunteers and overseers, 


34:13.868 --> 34:16.170
really, 
at will when we asked for them, 


34:16.170 --> 34:18.572
but they were still 
not going to be enough. 


34:18.572 --> 34:21.609
We were going to need 
to do heavy site work 


34:21.608 --> 34:24.711
simultaneous with building 
and construction. 


34:24.712 --> 34:28.784
That’s not necessarily 
the best way to go about it. 


34:28.783 --> 34:31.718
There are a lot of clashes 
when that happens. 


34:31.718 --> 34:34.955
It makes workers less productive 


34:34.955 --> 34:37.392
because it’s hard 
to move around the spaces. 


34:37.392 --> 34:40.060
We were going to have 
all six major buildings 


34:40.060 --> 34:42.028
in construction simultaneously. 


34:42.028 --> 34:44.031
We’d come to find out 
we were going to need 


34:44.032 --> 34:47.135
to have 11 cranes 
swinging in the air. 


34:47.135 --> 34:51.505
These things, along with 20 telehandlers 
going around the site, 


34:51.505 --> 34:53.975
moving this material 
that Rich talked about, 


34:53.975 --> 34:55.977
were going to be daunting.


34:55.977 --> 34:57.812
And Brother Ken Caughron?


34:57.812 --> 35:01.915
One aspect of my assignment 
was to work with safety. 


35:01.915 --> 35:06.753
So it was very daunting 
in the beginning to imagine: 


35:06.753 --> 35:11.625
How will we provide 
safety orientation and training 


35:11.625 --> 35:14.362
to thousands 
of volunteers coming in? 


35:14.362 --> 35:18.332
And then, 
what would be the best way 


35:18.332 --> 35:20.367
to motivate 
our brothers and sisters 


35:20.367 --> 35:23.000
on the very serious subject 
of safety?


35:24.338 --> 35:27.341
And safety is a concern of all 
of Jehovah’s people 


35:27.342 --> 35:29.610
no matter what we’re doing. 


35:29.610 --> 35:31.612
Brother Troy Snyder.


35:31.612 --> 35:33.414
We needed the high skill. 


35:33.413 --> 35:34.915
We needed the friends to come. 


35:34.915 --> 35:37.685
We needed large amounts 
as Brother Chernish mentioned. 


35:37.685 --> 35:39.687
But how would we care for them? 


35:39.687 --> 35:44.325
At one point, we grew 
in an eight-month period over a thousand, 


35:44.325 --> 35:46.360
and we did. 


35:46.360 --> 35:48.462
What type of rooming 
would we have for them? 


35:48.462 --> 35:51.699
How would we care for them 
spiritually and physically? 


35:51.698 --> 35:53.700
At one time, 
we found ourselves 


35:53.700 --> 35:56.737
with a kitchen and dining room 
designed for 200 and trying to feed


35:56.737 --> 35:58.472
about 1,000 people. 


35:58.472 --> 36:01.875
We certainly could feel that 
it was as if Jesus 


36:01.875 --> 36:04.112
was in that kitchen 
multiplying the loaves.


36:04.112 --> 36:06.880
You had good support. 


36:06.880 --> 36:11.085
But now, 
you’ve enumerated understandable 


36:11.085 --> 36:14.688
concerns and challenges. 


36:14.688 --> 36:18.591
Could you give some examples 
on how those were resolved? 


36:18.592 --> 36:21.829
And we’ll come back 
to Brother Caughron for this one.


36:21.828 --> 36:24.365
We realized that we wanted 


36:24.365 --> 36:28.535
to move away 
from any inclination or thinking 


36:28.535 --> 36:33.207
that safety is somehow the first 
responsibility of a safety department 


36:33.207 --> 36:36.377
or a safety brother 
coming around to check on us. 


36:36.377 --> 36:39.780
We wanted 
to put forth more effort 


36:39.780 --> 36:44.000
to teach that safety 
is an expression of our spirituality. 


36:45.987 --> 36:48.822
Once we started focusing 
on that teaching


36:48.822 --> 36:53.627
—that there are certain values 
such as the sanctity of life, 


36:53.627 --> 36:55.964
we love our brother, 


36:55.963 --> 36:59.266
we must maintain 
a good conscience before Jehovah—


36:59.267 --> 37:01.302
then the whole subject of safety 


37:01.302 --> 37:03.670
became very inspiring to work with. 


37:03.670 --> 37:05.673
It was a real joy. 


37:05.673 --> 37:08.808
In a practical way, 
on Sunday afternoon, 


37:08.808 --> 37:13.713
instead of having a three-hour 
safety orientation and training, 


37:13.713 --> 37:16.450
we developed a series of videos 


37:16.450 --> 37:18.518
that could be streamed 
to volunteers. 


37:18.518 --> 37:21.655
Before they came 
(several weeks ahead of time) 


37:21.655 --> 37:23.992
they could watch a video, 
take notes, 


37:23.992 --> 37:25.994
and watch it again 
if they wanted to. 


37:25.993 --> 37:30.631
And what it did is 
it significantly increased the quality 


37:30.632 --> 37:34.269
of our safety orientation and training 
for the entire project.


37:34.268 --> 37:37.271
Enrique Ford.


37:37.272 --> 37:41.242
We realized that we couldn’t 
be paralyzed by fear 


37:41.242 --> 37:45.045
just because we’d never done 
something this way before. 


37:45.045 --> 37:46.980
We had to move forward 
with faith. 


37:46.980 --> 37:49.917
An example 
of that was as a committee 


37:49.917 --> 37:54.189
we made the decision to model 
the building in three dimensions 


37:54.188 --> 37:57.090
on a computer 
before we started construction. 


37:57.090 --> 37:59.993
Now, 
we had never done that before


37:59.993 --> 38:02.061
—and not to speak of doing it 


38:02.062 --> 38:05.634
on a project of this scale, 
complexity, with this deadline—


38:05.633 --> 38:09.303
but we moved ahead in faith, 
and Jehovah blessed that effort.


38:09.303 --> 38:12.071
We’d like to develop that 
a little bit further. 


38:12.072 --> 38:14.175
You’ve given us some examples 


38:14.175 --> 38:17.612
of how Jehovah’s holy spirit 
was certainly there, 


38:17.612 --> 38:20.180
his guidance, 
and his blessing. 


38:20.180 --> 38:22.850
Could you give us some more 
examples of that? 


38:22.850 --> 38:24.885
We’ll start 
with Brother Chernish.


38:24.885 --> 38:27.755
A lot of decisions that were going 
to have to be made. 


38:27.755 --> 38:29.957
What could we self-perform? 


38:29.957 --> 38:32.059
What would 
we need to outsource 


38:32.058 --> 38:35.395
to get done in four years? 


38:35.395 --> 38:39.300
And we would also come to learn 
through this process 


38:39.300 --> 38:41.835
that if we stopped, 
if we prayed, 


38:41.835 --> 38:45.873
if we talked about it, 
and if we were all in unison, 


38:45.873 --> 38:48.441
we would see 
Jehovah’s direction. 


38:48.442 --> 38:51.012
It was 
very faith-strengthening, 


38:51.012 --> 38:53.480
and we would see 
Jehovah’s spirit 


38:53.480 --> 38:55.950
work upon the contractors 
that were working here. 


38:55.950 --> 38:58.318
They would come to us: 
“We’ve never swung 


38:58.318 --> 39:00.688
“this many panels 
on a building in a day. 


39:00.688 --> 39:02.155
“We did 33 today! 


39:02.155 --> 39:04.558
We’re accustomed 
to doing 16!” 


39:04.558 --> 39:06.593
We would chuckle 
off on the side. 


39:06.593 --> 39:08.661
We knew what they 
were benefiting from. 


39:08.662 --> 39:11.632
Jehovah too 
was moving their actions 


39:11.632 --> 39:14.735
because it was his will 
and his purpose for this to be done. 


39:14.735 --> 39:17.838
So seeing this level 
of blessing and holy spirit 


39:17.838 --> 39:19.840
was really faith-strengthening.


39:19.840 --> 39:22.977
Troy Snyder.


39:22.977 --> 39:26.514
Early on, we received a letter 
from the Governing Body 


39:26.513 --> 39:28.781
to our committee reminding us 


39:28.782 --> 39:32.520
that although they wanted 
the project done in an expedited fashion, 


39:32.520 --> 39:36.090
they didn’t want it done in a way 
that hurt the brothers spiritually. 


39:36.090 --> 39:39.493
And so we started 
consciously making efforts 


39:39.493 --> 39:41.761
to adjust ones’ schedules 


39:41.762 --> 39:43.764
so that they could attend 
their meetings, 


39:43.763 --> 39:46.366
so they could participate 
in the field ministry, 


39:46.367 --> 39:48.702
so that they would be able to benefit 


39:48.702 --> 39:51.105
from all the spiritual programs 


39:51.105 --> 39:53.807
that Bethel provides and has for us. 


39:53.807 --> 39:57.679
We were even able to adjust some 
of our dear sisters’ schedules 


39:57.678 --> 40:01.215
so that they too could keep up 
their spiritual routine. 


40:01.215 --> 40:03.217
And every time we did that, 


40:03.217 --> 40:05.619
it didn’t seem 
logical from a human standpoint, 


40:05.618 --> 40:08.255
but the project accelerated.


40:08.255 --> 40:10.190
Rich Devine.


40:10.190 --> 40:13.860
Well, I think we’ve prayed 
more on this project 


40:13.860 --> 40:17.130
than any other theocratic project 
I’ve ever been involved with 


40:17.130 --> 40:20.100
not only as a committee 
but every department 


40:20.100 --> 40:23.070
and every crew 
would pray together. 


40:23.070 --> 40:25.105
If we talked about work, 
we prayed. 


40:25.105 --> 40:28.042
Whether it was technical discussions 


40:28.042 --> 40:30.110
or anything else, we always prayed. 


40:30.110 --> 40:33.280
And it really made us feel that Jehovah 
was a part of our daily work


40:33.280 --> 40:35.248
—that we were really 
fellow workers with him—


40:35.248 --> 40:37.150
and we really felt that. 


40:37.150 --> 40:41.122
But also, I think the most dramatic evidence 
of Jehovah’s spirit 


40:41.122 --> 40:43.924
was the manifestation 
of the fruitage of the spirit 


40:43.923 --> 40:45.926
in our brothers and sisters. 


40:45.927 --> 40:49.164
Despite long work hours, 
hard working conditions, 


40:49.163 --> 40:52.966
difficult living conditions, 
an expedited schedule, 


40:52.967 --> 40:55.535
you could still 
see the love, the hope, 


40:55.535 --> 40:57.605
and the joy 
in the brothers every day. 


40:57.605 --> 41:00.773
And this really 
helped me to understand 


41:00.773 --> 41:03.343
how Jehovah’s spirit 
was so active here.


41:03.343 --> 41:06.346
What would you like to say 


41:06.347 --> 41:08.582
to the Bethel family 


41:08.582 --> 41:10.717
and to the thousands of willing, 


41:10.717 --> 41:15.022
hard-working volunteers that came 
from the field to assist you? 


41:15.022 --> 41:18.859
Perhaps we can start 
with Ken Caughron.


41:18.858 --> 41:21.628
Well, 
many thousands of years ago, 


41:21.628 --> 41:25.165
we remember 
the sacrifice of Abel 


41:25.165 --> 41:29.035
because out of love 
he gave the best he had. 


41:29.035 --> 41:33.007
So we say “thank you” 
to the brothers and sisters 


41:33.007 --> 41:35.642
who supported 
the project out in the field


41:35.642 --> 41:39.714
—out of love giving the best 
they had was often their prayers. 


41:39.713 --> 41:44.385
Others came physically, 
giving out of love the best they had. 


41:44.385 --> 41:47.922
So may all the brothers 
and sisters remember 


41:47.922 --> 41:52.159
that this was the reason 
they shared in the project, 


41:52.158 --> 41:54.961
and it is something 
that they and Jehovah 


41:54.962 --> 41:57.532
can remember for an eternity.


41:57.532 --> 42:01.535
Ken Chernish.


42:01.535 --> 42:03.670
Like Brother Caughron said, 


42:03.670 --> 42:05.672
I would just like 
to say “thank you” 


42:05.672 --> 42:09.277
and especially to all 
of the brothers and sisters 


42:09.277 --> 42:13.047
in the Bethel complexes 
in the U.S. branch territory. 


42:13.047 --> 42:15.715
They treated us like a parent 


42:15.715 --> 42:19.118
would treat a child
—so lovingly. 


42:19.118 --> 42:23.423
They gave us everything 
we asked for that we needed. 


42:23.423 --> 42:26.726
The friends out in the field, 
we’ve talked about them so much. 


42:26.727 --> 42:29.630
They turned their lives upside down 


42:29.630 --> 42:31.765
to come here and work with us. 


42:31.765 --> 42:33.967
Did they benefit? 
Absolutely! 


42:33.967 --> 42:36.837
And we so appreciate 


42:36.837 --> 42:39.507
how they put up with us, 
how things changed, 


42:39.507 --> 42:43.877
and the schedules that we imputed 
upon them to get this work done. 


42:43.877 --> 42:46.080
We know they benefited 
as we did, 


42:46.080 --> 42:48.348
and we’d like 
to thank them so much.


42:48.348 --> 42:51.118
Rich Devine.


42:51.118 --> 42:53.153
Thank you 
for sacrificing your money 


42:53.153 --> 42:55.188
and your time 
to come and help us. 


42:55.188 --> 42:58.958
Thank you for interviewing 
and sending such capable volunteers. 


42:58.958 --> 43:01.661
Thanks for working 
in the rain and the snow. 


43:01.662 --> 43:05.967
Thanks for enduring 
long bus rides and living in hotels. 


43:05.967 --> 43:08.035
Thanks for being our friends, 


43:08.035 --> 43:12.607
and thanks for the wonderful spirit 
that you showed through the whole project.


43:12.607 --> 43:14.642
Enrique Ford.


43:14.642 --> 43:18.279
As we had the opportunity 
to eat with the volunteers, 


43:18.278 --> 43:20.580
work with them, 
and travel with them, 


43:20.580 --> 43:23.350
it became evident 
that every one of them 


43:23.350 --> 43:25.918
had a story as 
to how they got here. 


43:25.918 --> 43:29.000
Sometimes it was 
the supportive mate 


43:33.360 --> 43:36.863
Other times, 
they talked about their children 


43:36.863 --> 43:39.433
and how their children 
encouraged them 


43:39.433 --> 43:42.101
and supported them
so that they could be here. 


43:42.102 --> 43:44.772
There are even 
some brothers that told us 


43:44.772 --> 43:47.274
about how 
the entire congregation 


43:47.273 --> 43:49.776
supported them financially


43:49.777 --> 43:52.379
as well as covering 
their assignments back home 


43:52.378 --> 43:57.183
because the congregation wanted to sponsor 
someone since they couldn’t come. 


43:57.183 --> 44:01.021
So we just want to thank 
all of those volunteers 


44:01.022 --> 44:06.527
and the support that made it possible 
for them to come.


44:06.527 --> 44:08.529
Troy Snyder?


44:08.528 --> 44:10.763
We love you very much. 


44:10.763 --> 44:14.266
And Jehovah united us as a family 


44:14.267 --> 44:17.805
in a period of time to accomplish 
something for his glory. 


44:17.805 --> 44:20.673
And I think we personally would love


44:20.673 --> 44:23.943
to be able to express our appreciation


44:23.943 --> 44:27.080
and reward each person 
for what they’ve done. 


44:27.080 --> 44:31.085
But we take such comfort in knowing 
that Jehovah has seen their love, 


44:31.085 --> 44:34.187
has seen their work, 
and he will reward them. 


44:34.187 --> 44:36.624
And that will be a rich blessing.


44:36.623 --> 44:39.000
Thank you 
for those heartfelt expressions. 


44:41.228 --> 44:45.931
And in conclusion, 
we just have a few brief comments. 


44:45.932 --> 44:49.870
We have heard, and rightfully so, 
the Governing Body 


44:49.870 --> 44:53.273
offer warm commendation and appreciation 


44:53.273 --> 44:55.875
to all of you on this committee


44:55.875 --> 44:59.513
as well as to the thousands 
who have supported the project. 


44:59.513 --> 45:01.981
And at this time, 


45:01.982 --> 45:04.852
we’d also like 
to take this opportunity 


45:04.852 --> 45:06.854
to thank your wives 


45:06.853 --> 45:09.923
for their hard work 
on this project, 


45:09.923 --> 45:11.925
their patience, their endurance, 


45:11.925 --> 45:14.862
and their absolute support that they gave. 


45:14.862 --> 45:16.597
It’s most appreciated. 


45:16.597 --> 45:18.899
And I know you appreciate 
their support, 


45:18.898 --> 45:20.900
and we do too. 


45:20.900 --> 45:23.903
So the lessons 
that we all learned


45:23.903 --> 45:26.373
—thanks to you, from this project 


45:26.373 --> 45:28.841
and thanks to Jehovah most of all—


45:28.842 --> 45:31.179
will benefit us now 


45:31.178 --> 45:34.881
and right on into the future 
as your comments have alluded to. 


45:34.882 --> 45:39.252
So once again, thank you for taking the time 
to share these observations. 


45:39.252 --> 45:41.255
Thank you for your hard work. 


45:41.255 --> 45:43.090
And it will be a privilege


45:43.090 --> 45:46.193
for all of us to continue 
to work “shoulder to shoulder” 


45:46.193 --> 45:51.000
with “the one who constructed 
all things,” Jehovah God.


45:59.372 --> 46:02.910
There was one word that stood out 
in this interview, 


46:02.910 --> 46:05.712
and it was the word “daunting.” 


46:05.712 --> 46:09.415
And, of course, 
that is a beautiful word. 


46:09.415 --> 46:12.585
It’s a good word. 


46:12.585 --> 46:17.490
But when you see what was accomplished 
in the past four years, 


46:17.490 --> 46:20.093
you’ll see why we’re going to change 


46:20.093 --> 46:24.396
the word “daunting” to “amazing.” 


46:24.397 --> 46:27.467
So lock that one in. 


46:27.467 --> 46:29.504
I mentioned earlier 


46:29.503 --> 46:33.740
that this was 
a Governing Body directed project. 


46:33.740 --> 46:36.910
CPC was indeed a unique way 


46:36.910 --> 46:40.880
to expedite the construction. 


46:40.880 --> 46:45.718
However, all that was accomplished 
on the Warwick project 


46:45.718 --> 46:49.923
is a result of the base 
of experience and, of course, 


46:49.923 --> 46:51.925
all the wonderful training 


46:51.925 --> 46:55.162
that had been laid 
for the last several decades 


46:55.162 --> 47:00.000
by the Design/Build Department—
that’s DBD. 


47:01.168 --> 47:03.870
They did a lot in planning and executing 


47:03.870 --> 47:06.340
construction projects around the world. 


47:06.340 --> 47:10.443
And the amazing Warwick project 


47:10.443 --> 47:13.546
would not have happened in that time frame 


47:13.547 --> 47:16.115
without the thousands of volunteers, 


47:16.115 --> 47:19.987
many of whom for years tirelessly assisted 


47:19.987 --> 47:25.025
Regional Building Committees
—RBC. 


47:25.025 --> 47:28.128
They are sent to them to build so many 


47:28.128 --> 47:32.131
Assembly and Kingdom Halls 
month after month. 


47:32.132 --> 47:35.235
And the same is true 
of all of the volunteers 


47:35.235 --> 47:37.470
that came and assisted 


47:37.470 --> 47:40.407
with the monumental expansion 


47:40.407 --> 47:43.410
of the Wallkill branch facility. 


47:43.410 --> 47:45.612
Now, would you brothers and sisters like 


47:45.612 --> 47:48.749
to thank all of these ones who supported 


47:48.748 --> 47:52.000
two of the largest construction 
projects to date?


48:15.275 --> 48:17.610
I might mention


48:17.610 --> 48:21.582
that on Friday, 
October 14, 2016, 


48:21.582 --> 48:24.550
a new video 
about moving out of Brooklyn 


48:24.550 --> 48:27.988
will be posted 
on JW Broadcasting. 


48:27.988 --> 48:30.890
You will find it under 
“Latest Videos.” 


48:30.890 --> 48:34.695
At the end of that video, 
a letter from the Governing Body is read 


48:34.695 --> 48:39.098
sharing sincere appreciation 
for all those who worked 


48:39.098 --> 48:42.068
on these two construction projects. 


48:42.068 --> 48:44.938
It will be posted in English first 


48:44.938 --> 48:48.141
with other languages 
being posted at a later time. 


48:48.142 --> 48:51.745
Look for the English edition 
on JW Broadcasting 


48:51.745 --> 48:55.000
on October 14, 2016. 


48:57.083 --> 49:01.488
For your further information, 


49:01.488 --> 49:04.658
the CPC was dissolved 


49:04.658 --> 49:08.428
as of September 29, 2016. 


49:08.428 --> 49:12.465
They will all be moving on 
to other assignments. 


49:12.465 --> 49:31.935
And we appreciate very much 
their intense labor of love.

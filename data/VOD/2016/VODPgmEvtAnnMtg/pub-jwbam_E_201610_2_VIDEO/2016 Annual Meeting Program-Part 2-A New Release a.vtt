00:01.217 --> 00:03.654
We now have a special treat. 


00:03.653 --> 00:06.221
Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body 


00:06.222 --> 00:10.260
will give a talk 
based on a specific Bible verse. 


00:10.260 --> 00:15.032
His talk is “‘Sing Out Joyfully’ to Jehovah!” 


00:15.032 --> 00:21.000
Mark my words, this is a special treat!


00:28.978 --> 00:32.000
I hope I can live up to his comments.


00:36.787 --> 00:41.057
David did it as he played on his harp. 


00:41.057 --> 00:45.062
The Levites did it regularly at the temple. 


00:45.062 --> 00:49.999
Jesus did it shortly before being executed. 


00:49.998 --> 00:55.871
Paul and Silas did it while in stocks, 
deep in a prison dungeon. 


00:55.872 --> 00:59.142
The resurrected anointed do it 


00:59.142 --> 01:02.612
as they stand before Jehovah’s throne. 


01:02.612 --> 01:06.015
What activity are we talking about? 


01:06.015 --> 01:11.020
We’re talking about singing 
songs of praise to Jehovah. 


01:11.020 --> 01:15.558
And, of course, all of us want 
to imitate these fine Bible examples. 


01:15.558 --> 01:18.695
But now, 
how do we want to sing these songs? 


01:18.695 --> 01:20.130
What approach? 


01:20.130 --> 01:23.332
Well, let’s go to 1 Chronicles 15, 


01:23.332 --> 01:26.870
and let’s see how we want to sing 


01:26.870 --> 01:30.038
these songs of praise. 


01:30.038 --> 01:33.610
First Chronicles 15:16: 


01:33.610 --> 01:37.347
“David then told the chiefs of the Levites 


01:37.347 --> 01:40.184
“to appoint their brothers the singers,” 


01:40.183 --> 01:44.686
now notice, “to sing out joyfully, 


01:44.687 --> 01:48.057
“accompanied by musical instruments: 


01:48.057 --> 01:52.562
stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals.”


01:52.562 --> 01:57.400
Now, does this scripture say 
that we should move our lips 


01:57.400 --> 02:00.770
but with no sound 
coming out of our mouth? 


02:00.770 --> 02:03.907
Can you imagine Jesus singing like that? 


02:03.907 --> 02:07.444
Does this scripture indicate 
we should mumble our words? 


02:07.443 --> 02:11.446
speak in an undertone, 
like we do sometimes when we read the Bible? 


02:11.447 --> 02:14.584
No, we’re told “to sing out”! 


02:14.583 --> 02:19.121
That means, obviously, 
enthusiastically projecting our voices. 


02:19.122 --> 02:21.859
Perhaps you remember a picture 


02:21.858 --> 02:26.863
in the inside cover pages 
of one of our previous songbooks. 


02:26.863 --> 02:29.931
It was a picture of the Levites singing. 


02:29.932 --> 02:33.369
And obviously they 
were projecting their voices. 


02:33.368 --> 02:37.000
In fact, their mouths were so wide open, 
you could almost see their tonsils. 


02:38.675 --> 02:41.277
Well, good example for us.


02:41.277 --> 02:43.279
Think about this: 


02:43.278 --> 02:45.915
Many worldly people will sing out 


02:45.915 --> 02:48.985
worldly songs with a joyful attitude. 


02:48.985 --> 02:52.122
Well, much more so to our God, 


02:52.122 --> 02:55.192
who is worthy 
of such worshipful praise, 


02:55.192 --> 02:59.229
do we want to give it 
to him enthusiastically. 


02:59.228 --> 03:02.131
But now let’s look at a brief video 


03:02.132 --> 03:05.935
that highlights some of the history 
of how Jehovah’s people 


03:05.935 --> 03:10.000
have always felt about singing 
songs of praise to Jehovah.


03:12.075 --> 03:14.210
I love singing to Jehovah. 


03:14.210 --> 03:19.082
It’s something 
that I find so personally strengthening.


03:19.082 --> 03:21.717
I think it’s such a wonderful privilege 


03:21.717 --> 03:22.719
to be able to praise 


03:22.718 --> 03:24.786
Jehovah’s name by singing. 


03:24.787 --> 03:28.290
Mind you, I would never be called 
a professional singer.


03:28.290 --> 03:30.293
We know that birds sing, 


03:30.293 --> 03:32.528
but they’re not singing praises to Jehovah. 


03:32.528 --> 03:35.398
And, of course, dogs bark and cats meow, 


03:35.398 --> 03:39.868
but humans can really sing 
and praise Jehovah with their words.


03:39.868 --> 03:43.573
And it always reminds me 
of the account in the book of Acts, 


03:43.573 --> 03:45.341
Acts chapter 16, 


03:45.342 --> 03:50.145
where it talks about the apostle Paul 
and Silas when they were in prison. 


03:50.145 --> 03:52.615
It says: 
“But about the middle of the night, 


03:52.615 --> 03:54.650
“Paul and Silas were praying 


03:54.650 --> 03:57.187
“and praising God with song, 


03:57.187 --> 03:59.789
and the prisoners were listening to them.” 


03:59.788 --> 04:03.291
Obviously, 
the songs that they sang at that time 


04:03.292 --> 04:06.462
helped them to ease the pain 
of their very sore backs; 


04:06.462 --> 04:08.464
they had been beaten. 


04:08.463 --> 04:13.000
So the spiritual side of us 
becomes stronger when we sing.


04:15.405 --> 04:16.905
In our organization 


04:16.905 --> 04:20.377
from the very beginning, hymns were used. 


04:20.377 --> 04:22.612
But then the brothers and sisters 


04:22.612 --> 04:24.747
began producing their own songs, 


04:24.747 --> 04:27.484
and they put them into a book form.


04:27.483 --> 04:31.020
Back in 1944, 
we released a songbook 


04:31.020 --> 04:34.357
that was called 
the Kingdom Service Songbook. 


04:34.357 --> 04:37.827
And after a half million copies 
had been released 


04:37.827 --> 04:40.897
and just six years later (1950), 


04:40.897 --> 04:44.900
we came out with a brand new songbook, 
Songs to Jehovah’s Praise. 


04:44.900 --> 04:46.902
Now, no doubt 
many of the brothers wondered, 


04:46.902 --> 04:48.939
‘Why are we doing this?’ 


04:48.938 --> 04:50.038
But, of course, you see, 


04:50.038 --> 04:52.841
the New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures 


04:52.842 --> 04:55.110
had just been released in 1950.


04:55.110 --> 04:57.047
And then we’ve had several books 
that have been released 


04:57.047 --> 04:59.549
down through the decades. 


04:59.548 --> 05:03.000
So it’s always been 
a part of the modern-day worship.


05:15.398 --> 05:19.568
You know, when you ponder 
what we’ve discussed thus far, 


05:19.568 --> 05:22.571
you’re probably beginning to ask yourself, 


05:22.572 --> 05:26.000
‘When are we going to get our new songbook?’ 


05:29.245 --> 05:33.315
Well, I must tell you 
that the songbook project 


05:33.315 --> 05:36.018
has proved to be more challenging, 


05:36.018 --> 05:39.455
more complex 
than the Governing Body anticipated. 


05:39.455 --> 05:44.127
But, nevertheless, 
despite the challenges and the complications, 


05:44.127 --> 05:47.730
we’re confident that we’re going 
to be able to release this book 


05:47.730 --> 05:52.000
to you within less than 12 months. 


06:04.413 --> 06:08.650
In fact, we’re talking 
about much less than 12 months. 


06:08.650 --> 06:10.853
We’re talking about right now! 


06:10.853 --> 06:15.000
The Governing Body 
is very happy to release . . . 


06:25.835 --> 06:29.638
I don’t think I had most of you fooled. 


06:29.638 --> 06:33.541
We are so happy to release this new songbook, 


06:33.542 --> 06:37.347
entitled “Sing Out Joyfully” to Jehovah. 


06:37.347 --> 06:43.000
That’s the “SOJJ” book, Brother Herd.


06:55.397 --> 06:59.035
This new songbook, 
“Sing Out Joyfully” to Jehovah, 


06:59.035 --> 07:02.838
is being provided in three formats: 


07:02.838 --> 07:07.876
There’s the small 
and the large with musical notations, 


07:07.877 --> 07:12.882
and then there’s 
(in the large size only) lyrics only. 


07:12.882 --> 07:16.985
And you’re going to be able 
to obtain your personal copy 


07:16.985 --> 07:19.922
electronically in English. 


07:19.922 --> 07:22.825
This will be Monday, October the 3rd. 


07:22.825 --> 07:24.827
So we’re talking 
about just two days from now. 


07:24.827 --> 07:27.797
You can go on jw.org, 


07:27.797 --> 07:30.634
Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY, 


07:30.633 --> 07:32.635
or JW Library, 


07:32.635 --> 07:36.505
and you can get that copy 
of this beautiful songbook.


07:36.505 --> 07:38.540
But now, here’s a question, 


07:38.540 --> 07:44.213
How soon are we going to sing 
songs from the new songbook? 


07:44.213 --> 07:46.948
Well, you’ll be happy to know 
that beginning in January, 


07:46.948 --> 07:48.951
just three months from now, 


07:48.952 --> 07:53.455
English-speaking congregations 
will begin to sing these new songs. 


07:53.455 --> 07:55.592
And you’ll be happy to know, too, 


07:55.592 --> 07:59.162
that the Governing Body 
has arranged for a new provision 


07:59.162 --> 08:01.964
to come along with the new songbook. 


08:01.963 --> 08:06.968
We’re going to have 
the lyrics in video format. 


08:06.968 --> 08:11.773
Now, we enjoyed right here 
having the lyrics on the screen, 


08:11.773 --> 08:15.511
and we enjoyed it 
during the summer conventions


08:15.512 --> 08:17.980
—the regional and the special conventions. 


08:17.980 --> 08:20.115
Instead of having to look down 


08:20.115 --> 08:24.353
and try to look at your songbook 
or your tablet, 


08:24.353 --> 08:27.690
we were able to hold our heads erect 


08:27.690 --> 08:31.360
and sing out joyfully to Jehovah. 


08:31.360 --> 08:34.000
Well, you’ll be able 
to do that in the congregation.


08:46.875 --> 08:51.247
But now, we talked about receiving 
our songbook electronically, 


08:51.247 --> 08:55.585
and we noticed that many of you 
are using electronic devices 


08:55.585 --> 08:59.155
in order to receive 
the publications and to use them. 


08:59.155 --> 09:01.157
And this is commendable. 


09:01.157 --> 09:04.360
This saves the organization 
considerable funds. 


09:04.360 --> 09:08.630
But what if you want 
a hard copy of the new songbook? 


09:08.630 --> 09:12.268
Well, we’re happy 
to inform you that you can order 


09:12.268 --> 09:15.771
through the congregation a hard copy. 


09:15.772 --> 09:18.942
Within a few days, 
English-speaking congregations 


09:18.942 --> 09:22.312
and also several other 
foreign-language speaking congregations 


09:22.312 --> 09:24.647
will receive a letter 


09:24.647 --> 09:27.950
telling you how you may submit the order. 


09:27.950 --> 09:30.318
And we’re happy to inform you too 


09:30.318 --> 09:34.223
that the hard copy songbook will have, 


09:34.223 --> 09:36.525
whether it’s the small or the large, 


09:36.525 --> 09:40.863
it’ll have the same 
beautiful gray deluxe cover 


09:40.863 --> 09:44.400
that our revised 
New World Translation Bible has. 


09:44.400 --> 09:48.737
So what a beautiful compliment 
the songbook will be to the Bible. 


09:48.737 --> 09:51.274
For those who use hard copy, 


09:51.273 --> 09:54.110
you will truly enjoy using 


09:54.110 --> 09:58.000
the beautiful “gray twins.”


10:09.458 --> 10:12.295
But now, 
we talked about English mostly. 


10:12.295 --> 10:14.463
What about other languages? 


10:14.463 --> 10:19.135
Well, translations are being made 
into other languages as we speak. 


10:19.135 --> 10:23.738
And as soon as possible, 
these other language releases will be made. 


10:23.738 --> 10:26.241
In fact, I’ve been informed 


10:26.242 --> 10:29.779
that there will be 
quite a number of other languages. 


10:29.778 --> 10:32.581
We’ll be able to release 
the songbook in those languages 


10:32.582 --> 10:35.000
within less than 12 months. 


10:36.352 --> 10:39.000
And this time, I’m not teasing. 


10:40.388 --> 10:44.593
But additional information 
will be provided as soon as available.


10:44.593 --> 10:47.430
But now, 
let’s discuss some interesting information 


10:47.430 --> 10:49.598
about the new songbook. 


10:49.598 --> 10:52.968
First, we’re going to talk 
about the composition of the songs 


10:52.968 --> 10:56.705
and then a little bit 
about the structure of the songbook. 


10:56.705 --> 10:59.042
But now you’re probably thinking: 


10:59.042 --> 11:03.000
‘Why is Brother Splane not presenting 
this information?


11:04.447 --> 11:07.917
Why is Brother Lett trying to present this?’ 


11:07.917 --> 11:10.000
Well, I can understand your question; 


11:13.322 --> 11:16.000
I had the same question. 


11:17.927 --> 11:19.929
But the truth is, 


11:19.928 --> 11:24.633
all seven members 
of the Governing Body love, very much, 


11:24.633 --> 11:27.470
singing songs of praise to Jehovah. 


11:27.470 --> 11:31.273
Of course, some are 
a lot better singers than the rest of us. 


11:31.273 --> 11:35.978
And all of us are happy that we 
don’t have student singing assignments 


11:35.978 --> 11:38.000
on the midweek meeting 


11:39.915 --> 11:44.000
because we wouldn’t want to send 
the brothers running for their earplugs. 


11:45.187 --> 11:48.190
But now I’ve got to get serious.


11:48.190 --> 11:52.193
Let’s talk about the composition 
of the songs. 


11:52.193 --> 11:54.196
Well, here’s an interesting point: 


11:54.197 --> 11:58.700
Rather than request 
contributed songs from various songwriters, 


11:58.700 --> 12:01.870
the Governing Body assigned a composer 


12:01.870 --> 12:06.575
and a lyricist team 
to work specifically on the project. 


12:06.575 --> 12:10.747
And then the Governing Body 
closely supervised that team. 


12:10.747 --> 12:15.284
For example, 
providing subject themes for songs 


12:15.283 --> 12:17.720
that would be very relevant 
to our meetings, 


12:17.720 --> 12:21.990
assemblies, conventions, 
and the field ministry. 


12:21.990 --> 12:24.227
And the team worked very hard 


12:24.227 --> 12:26.895
specifically crafting each song 


12:26.895 --> 12:29.565
according to that direction. 


12:29.565 --> 12:31.867
Here’s another point that you can imagine: 


12:31.867 --> 12:34.370
The revised New World Translation 


12:34.370 --> 12:37.640
resulted in changing a lot of the lyrics


12:37.640 --> 12:40.843
—a replacement of different words 
and expressions. 


12:40.843 --> 12:42.845
Just a few examples: 


12:42.845 --> 12:47.850
Most references to Sheol, seed, 
long-suffering have been replaced. 


12:47.850 --> 12:53.488
The song “Long-Suffering” 
is now “Exercise Patience.” 


12:53.488 --> 12:57.391
The expression “loving-kindness” 
is now “loyal love.” 


12:57.392 --> 12:59.662
“Time indefinite” has been replaced 


12:59.662 --> 13:04.667
with expressions 
such as “forevermore” or “eternal life.” 


13:04.667 --> 13:06.435
Here’s another point: 


13:06.435 --> 13:10.472
Doctrinal refinements, of course, 
affected some of the lyrics. 


13:10.472 --> 13:12.475
Just one example: 


13:12.475 --> 13:17.480
The expanded explanation 
of the meaning of Jehovah’s name 


13:17.480 --> 13:21.850
resulted in opening the door 
to more application 


13:21.850 --> 13:25.520
of Jehovah ‘Causing to Become.’ 


13:25.520 --> 13:27.523
Here’s another point: 


13:27.523 --> 13:29.525
An effort was made to have 


13:29.525 --> 13:33.462
less direct counsel in the songs. 


13:33.462 --> 13:37.934
So rather than some feeling awkward 
as they were singing praises 


13:37.933 --> 13:41.836
and that they were maybe giving 
counsel to others as they were singing


13:41.837 --> 13:43.872
—well, we’ve changed that. 


13:43.872 --> 13:45.875
That has been taken out.


13:45.875 --> 13:47.475
Here’s another thing: 


13:47.475 --> 13:49.978
Certain awkward expressions 


13:49.978 --> 13:52.413
have been removed from the songs. 


13:52.413 --> 13:54.416
Just one example: 


13:54.417 --> 13:56.685
In one of our current songs, 


13:56.685 --> 13:59.087
there’s an expression that makes it appear 


13:59.087 --> 14:02.792
that single people are probably lonely. 


14:02.792 --> 14:05.000
Well, we took that out. 


14:08.063 --> 14:10.165
Here’s another detail, 


14:10.165 --> 14:13.868
and we present this in the form of a caution: 


14:13.868 --> 14:18.040
Be careful when you are singing 
from the new songbook 


14:18.040 --> 14:20.575
because the majority of the songs


14:20.575 --> 14:24.713
—these older songs—
have had lyrics adjusted. 


14:24.713 --> 14:28.216
So if you just sing 
from your previous memory bank, 


14:28.217 --> 14:32.054
you’re going to find 
yourself often in trouble. 


14:32.053 --> 14:36.125
But now, just a few comments 
about the structure of the songbook: 


14:36.125 --> 14:40.628
An effort has been made 
to put the songs in subject order. 


14:40.628 --> 14:43.631
And there are 15 categories now, 


14:43.632 --> 14:47.970
and the categories are listed 
in the index in the front of the songbook. 


14:47.970 --> 14:50.038
The first 12 songs 


14:50.038 --> 14:54.810
appropriately are 
under the category “Jehovah,” 


14:54.810 --> 14:58.447
and these are songs 
of direct praise to Jehovah 


14:58.447 --> 15:02.384
or songs about his name 
or his qualities. 


15:02.383 --> 15:05.720
“Meeting Together”
—that’s another category—


15:05.720 --> 15:10.392
songs about our meeting together 
and worshipping together. 


15:10.392 --> 15:13.562
The category “Godly Qualities”


15:13.562 --> 15:17.432
—and included 
among other songs in this section 


15:17.432 --> 15:20.702
are songs that develop each one 


15:20.702 --> 15:24.105
of the aspects 
of the fruitage of the holy spirit 


15:24.105 --> 15:27.008
mentioned at Galatians 5:22, 23. 


15:27.008 --> 15:30.311
And they’re developed 
in the order in the songbook 


15:30.312 --> 15:32.615
that they’re listed in that scripture. 


15:32.615 --> 15:34.617
So that’s very helpful. 


15:34.617 --> 15:37.987
But now here’s something 
we’d like to say regarding the structure: 


15:37.987 --> 15:42.925
There is no significance to the song numbers 


15:42.925 --> 15:45.460
assigned to each song. 


15:45.460 --> 15:48.430
Over the years, 
some have worked very hard 


15:48.430 --> 15:52.400
to try to figure out 
the significance of the song numbers. 


15:52.400 --> 15:54.503
For example, 


15:54.503 --> 15:58.573
many concluded 
it wasn’t just coincidence 


15:58.573 --> 16:03.000
that the song “Be Forgiving” 
was song number 77. 


16:05.713 --> 16:08.216
Similarly, 


16:08.217 --> 16:11.620
the song “We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses,” 


16:11.620 --> 16:14.122
many thought 
it was no coincidence that that song 


16:14.122 --> 16:18.000
was song number 1931; I mean 31. 


16:19.962 --> 16:22.164
But we want to tell you up front, 


16:22.163 --> 16:27.168
there is no significance 
to the numbering and, 


16:27.168 --> 16:32.000
for that matter, 
there was not in the current songbook. 


16:33.708 --> 16:36.178
The numbers are random, 


16:36.178 --> 16:40.581
with the songs placed 
in the category they fit best in 


16:40.582 --> 16:45.000
and where they fit best 
in regard to the engraving layout.


16:46.022 --> 16:48.024
Now, here’s another thought: 


16:48.023 --> 16:51.526
Three of the older songs 
have been removed 


16:51.527 --> 16:53.962
from the new songbook. 


16:53.962 --> 16:58.134
And quite a number 
have been totally revised with new subjects. 


16:58.133 --> 17:01.936
For example, the song 
“The Scene of This World Is Changing” 


17:01.937 --> 17:06.709
has now been totally revised 
to a more positive subject, 


17:06.708 --> 17:10.045
“Keep Working, Watching, and Waiting.” 


17:10.045 --> 17:13.048
The song “Making Our Way Successful” 


17:13.048 --> 17:16.618
is now “Life Depends on God’s Word.” 


17:16.618 --> 17:19.855
The song formerly 
“Content With God’s Good Gifts,” 


17:19.855 --> 17:21.690
which had limited use, 


17:21.690 --> 17:23.958
is now “Teaching the Word of God”


17:23.958 --> 17:28.963
—a much more practical subject 
for our meetings or our field ministry. 


17:28.963 --> 17:32.466
Now, here’s one more point 
regarding the structure: 


17:32.467 --> 17:36.037
Many of the songs have been reformatted 


17:36.037 --> 17:38.774
and spread out over more pages. 


17:38.773 --> 17:40.141
Why? 


17:40.142 --> 17:44.012
Well, for one thing, 
it gives more space for other languages 


17:44.012 --> 17:46.215
that need more space 


17:46.215 --> 17:50.018
to be able to put the lyrics 
under the musical notes. 


17:50.018 --> 17:52.420
Another advantage by spreading them out: 


17:52.420 --> 17:54.723
It makes it easier to read the music 


17:54.723 --> 17:57.793
in the case of those who enjoy playing 


17:57.793 --> 18:00.595
the songs on piano. 


18:00.595 --> 18:03.132
But now, let’s look at another video, 


18:03.132 --> 18:07.435
and this one shows us some interesting facts 


18:07.435 --> 18:11.000
about the making of our new songbook.


18:12.808 --> 18:17.211
The Governing Body’s support 
for this project was unanimous.


18:17.212 --> 18:20.649
One of the reasons 
we felt it was especially important 


18:20.648 --> 18:23.551
was because of the revised 
New World Translation.


18:23.552 --> 18:26.889
It was important for us 
to change the songs as well, 


18:26.888 --> 18:31.426
so that all the terminology 
in the revised version would match the songs.


18:31.427 --> 18:34.329
In our audience, 
we have some of our brothers and sisters 


18:34.328 --> 18:36.331
who have the heavenly hope. 


18:36.332 --> 18:39.000
And, of course, 
the majority in our audience 


18:39.000 --> 18:42.537
are looking forward 
to life everlasting right here on the earth. 


18:42.537 --> 18:47.209
So the words of our songs 
would have to include both groups.


18:47.208 --> 18:49.945
There are a few songs 
that were very rarely used 


18:49.945 --> 18:53.382
at meetings and assemblies 
because of the subject. 


18:53.382 --> 18:57.419
They may have been relevant subjects 
years back but not anymore. 


18:57.418 --> 18:58.953
So those songs, 


18:58.953 --> 19:01.121
the same melody is being used 


19:01.122 --> 19:03.125
but you’ll find 
there’s a brand new theme.


19:03.125 --> 19:05.127
In our songbook in recent years, 


19:05.127 --> 19:07.129
there has definitely been an effort 


19:07.128 --> 19:09.565
to have more diversity of style. 


19:09.565 --> 19:11.667
It really helps all of us


19:11.667 --> 19:13.335
—no matter what our background 


19:13.335 --> 19:14.770
or from what part 
of the world we come from—


19:14.770 --> 19:16.805
to be unified in our worship.


19:16.805 --> 19:19.742
When we get the music from the arranger, 


19:19.742 --> 19:23.845
we have to format it so it fits properly 


19:23.845 --> 19:26.248
to the page 
as it will appear in the songbook. 


19:26.248 --> 19:28.250
We supply the branches 


19:28.250 --> 19:31.052
with music-only notation, 


19:31.052 --> 19:35.457
and this way 
they can pour in the translated lyrics.


19:35.457 --> 19:37.192
Songs really are 


19:37.192 --> 19:40.162
probably the most difficult 
translation project that you can handle. 


19:40.162 --> 19:44.199
Take an English verse 
like “listen, obey, and be blessed.” 


19:44.198 --> 19:47.401
It’s not difficult to express 
that idea in another language, 


19:47.402 --> 19:49.404
but the music there 


19:49.403 --> 19:53.141
has only seven notes: 
la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 


19:53.142 --> 19:56.612
So the challenge is to express those ideas 


19:56.612 --> 19:59.649
and make them 
fit into those seven notes. 


19:59.648 --> 20:02.450
So for all of these reasons, 
this is the work of a lyricist


20:02.450 --> 20:05.453
—someone who can rewrite the song 


20:05.453 --> 20:09.523
and make sure that it conveys 
the right ideas, the right mood, 


20:09.523 --> 20:11.793
but at the same time that it is poetic 


20:11.793 --> 20:14.000
and that it touches the heart 
of those who are going to sing it.


20:24.405 --> 20:26.708
What a wonderful thing to think 


20:26.708 --> 20:30.745
that worldwide in hundreds of languages 
our brothers and sisters 


20:30.745 --> 20:34.315
are having the very same experience: 


20:34.315 --> 20:38.820
being able to use their words 
to praise Jehovah in song.


20:38.820 --> 20:42.823
The Governing Body 
feels very strongly about singing. 


20:42.823 --> 20:45.326
So that’s why they actually created a cover 


20:45.327 --> 20:48.000
that looks 
just like the New World Translation. 


20:49.097 --> 20:52.267
The songbook has been organized 
into subject order. 


20:52.267 --> 20:55.537
There are more songs in the book; 
there are 151 songs. 


20:55.537 --> 20:58.507
But also the songs 
have been spread out a little bit more. 


20:58.507 --> 21:00.775
That’s mainly for translation.


21:00.775 --> 21:04.578
The website will have easier navigation tools 


21:04.578 --> 21:07.781
to help us to find 
the song number we’re looking for. 


21:07.782 --> 21:10.719
So we can listen to the song 
or the vocal rendition 


21:10.718 --> 21:14.055
while the phrase that is to be sung 


21:14.055 --> 21:16.525
during that portion 
of the song will highlight 


21:16.525 --> 21:18.527
as the song plays through.


21:18.527 --> 21:22.297
We need to take the time right now 
to learn these new songs 


21:22.297 --> 21:24.232
and then to sing them. 


21:24.232 --> 21:26.402
You know, sing them all the time


21:26.402 --> 21:28.070
—sing them 
when we’re working around the house, 


21:28.070 --> 21:30.772
sing them when we’re in the car, 


21:30.772 --> 21:33.409
sing them when we come together 
for social gatherings with our brothers. 


21:33.408 --> 21:37.711
They have the power to strengthen us.


21:37.712 --> 21:39.314
It’s showing respect for Jehovah 


21:39.313 --> 21:41.783
when we actually stand there 
with the congregation 


21:41.783 --> 21:43.785
and sing with the congregation. 


21:43.785 --> 21:46.622
It brings the congregation 
together in worship.


21:46.622 --> 21:51.092
So when we combine how we feel 
and when we sing from our hearts, 


21:51.092 --> 21:55.564
we can be sure that Jehovah 
will accept that as appreciation.


21:55.563 --> 22:00.068
Well, I think this scripture at Psalm 104:33 


22:00.068 --> 22:04.740
really reflects the feelings 
of all of Jehovah’s people when it says: 


22:04.740 --> 22:08.310
“I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life; 


22:08.310 --> 22:13.248
I will sing praises to my God 
as long as I live.” 


22:13.248 --> 22:15.583
That’s the desire that we all have


22:15.583 --> 22:19.000
—to be able to sing 
praises to Jehovah forever.


22:28.363 --> 22:31.933
Obviously, our new songbook 


22:31.933 --> 22:34.435
is a gift from the Giver 


22:34.435 --> 22:37.605
of “every good gift 
and every perfect present.” 


22:37.605 --> 22:42.610
You brothers and sisters are going 
to love singing from the new songbook. 


22:42.610 --> 22:46.180
So by all means, use it to the full. 


22:46.180 --> 22:48.350
Use it completely 


22:48.350 --> 22:54.000
to “sing out joyfully” to Jehovah!


23:08.803 --> 23:12.340
We told you it would be a special treat. 


23:12.340 --> 23:15.377
Not only was Brother Lett’s delivery special 


23:15.377 --> 23:20.315
but we have the special treat 
of a new songbook now. 


23:20.315 --> 23:22.683
And we add it 


23:22.683 --> 23:26.086
to the long line of songbooks 


23:26.087 --> 23:28.124
that have come before. 


23:28.123 --> 23:32.000
Some of you can reach back many years 
with various different songbooks. 


23:33.027 --> 23:36.565
The songbook is, 


23:36.565 --> 23:41.368
to describe it, praiseworthy. 


23:41.368 --> 23:44.105
You see that in your notes? 


23:44.105 --> 23:46.107
What does that mean? 


23:46.107 --> 23:50.000
Highly commendable
—that’s our songbook. 


23:51.145 --> 23:57.000
Now, if that was special, 
this next part is truly unique. 


23:58.253 --> 24:02.390
I do not remember ever hearing an interview 


24:02.390 --> 24:06.928
from this unique group of interviewees. 


24:06.928 --> 24:09.730
Brother Ralph Walls, 
a helper to the Personnel Committee 


24:09.730 --> 24:11.633
of the Governing Body, 


24:11.633 --> 24:15.970
will take the lead 
in the video interview entitled 


24:15.970 --> 24:20.742
Jehovah Cares for 
and Strengthens Faithful Ones. 


24:20.742 --> 24:23.000
The video, please.


24:27.982 --> 24:31.587
Jehovah’s care for each 
of his faithful servants 


24:31.587 --> 24:35.190
is felt especially 
during times of difficulty. 


24:35.190 --> 24:40.962
The apostle Paul experienced 
what he called “a thorn in the flesh.” 


24:40.962 --> 24:43.064
I’d like to read to you what he said 


24:43.063 --> 24:46.568
about that in 2 Corinthians chapter 12. 


24:46.568 --> 24:50.171
I’ll read portions of verses 9 and 10. 


24:50.172 --> 24:52.540
Speaking of the Lord, he said: 


24:52.540 --> 24:54.910
“But he said to me: 


24:54.910 --> 24:58.347
“‘My undeserved kindness 
is sufficient for you, 


24:58.347 --> 25:00.815
“‘for my power 


25:00.815 --> 25:04.318
is being made perfect in weakness.’” 


25:04.318 --> 25:06.320
Verse 10, 


25:06.320 --> 25:09.323
“So I take pleasure in weaknesses, 


25:09.323 --> 25:11.660
“ . . . and difficulties, for Christ. 


25:11.660 --> 25:16.000
For when I am weak, then I am powerful.”


25:17.165 --> 25:19.533
While it’s the responsibility of each one 


25:19.533 --> 25:22.870
to give balanced attention to their health, 


25:22.870 --> 25:26.608
still, there are problems that arise. 


25:26.608 --> 25:29.243
Therefore, the Governing Body 
has made arrangements 


25:29.243 --> 25:33.381
for all branches 
to assist special full-time servants 


25:33.382 --> 25:35.884
with their health-care needs 
and, that is, 


25:35.883 --> 25:38.853
within the circumstances 
of each branch. 


25:38.853 --> 25:42.090
The United States branch is privileged 


25:42.090 --> 25:45.327
to have a group 
of dedicated brothers and sisters 


25:45.327 --> 25:48.297
who render such care. 


25:48.297 --> 25:52.167
We’re going to talk to nine 
of our physicians serving at Bethel, 


25:52.167 --> 25:56.337
and we’re going 
to introduce them alphabetically.


25:56.337 --> 25:59.007
First, we have Brother Samuel Worae Boakye, 


25:59.007 --> 26:02.710
who’s been serving us for 11 years at Bethel; 


26:02.710 --> 26:07.000
Brother Jack Carleton, 
who’s been with us for 40 years 


26:08.383 --> 26:12.686
(it’s hard to believe 
because Jack claims he’s 39); 


26:12.687 --> 26:17.025
Anne Marie Correia, 
who’s been with us for three years; 


26:17.025 --> 26:20.895
Enrique Corvalan, for eight years; 


26:20.895 --> 26:24.732
Brother Walter Ferguson, for 30 years; 


26:24.732 --> 26:27.902
Luis Garza, 26 years; 


26:27.902 --> 26:32.274
Brother James Harper, for 26 years; 


26:32.273 --> 26:35.210
Brother James Howard, for 28 years; 


26:35.210 --> 26:38.713
and Olga Manson, for 15 years. 


26:38.713 --> 26:41.850
What a wonderful representative group!


26:41.850 --> 26:44.718
I’d like to ask you dear folks 


26:44.718 --> 26:47.921
to share with us your experience 
of learning the truth 


26:47.922 --> 26:50.000
and how that impacted your profession. 


26:51.660 --> 26:54.762
And, Brother Carleton, 
would you please start off with it?


26:54.762 --> 26:58.232
The truth was introduced 
through the door-to-door ministry. 


26:58.232 --> 27:00.635
I was doing research 
at the National Institutes of Health 


27:00.635 --> 27:03.170
in Washington, D.C., 
and the Cancer Institute 


27:03.170 --> 27:05.173
and planning 
to go on into neurosurgery. 


27:05.173 --> 27:06.708
But the knock came on the door. 


27:06.708 --> 27:09.410
The brother came in, 
and he presented the Kingdom hope 


27:09.410 --> 27:11.045
from Genesis to Revelation. 


27:11.045 --> 27:13.482
And my wife and I said: 
“That’s marvelous


27:13.482 --> 27:16.117
“—to live forever on earth 
and have no sickness 


27:16.117 --> 27:18.587
“and enjoy peace and security forever! 


27:18.587 --> 27:19.654
What a wonderful hope!” 


27:19.653 --> 27:22.556
And then he added to that, 
“You know that God has a name?” 


27:22.557 --> 27:23.659
And we didn’t know that. 


27:23.658 --> 27:26.761
So now to know Jehovah personally
—it touched us. 


27:26.762 --> 27:27.962
And that’s all it took. 


27:27.962 --> 27:30.632
From that time on, 
we wanted to be in full-time service 


27:30.632 --> 27:33.369
and aid Bethel, 
if we could, in the future.


27:33.368 --> 27:34.435
Very interesting. 


27:34.435 --> 27:35.470
Thank you. 


27:35.470 --> 27:37.472
And, Sister Correia, Anne Marie, 


27:37.472 --> 27:39.474
what about yourself?


27:39.473 --> 27:44.178
Well, I started to study the Bible 
in my last year of medical school 


27:44.178 --> 27:47.881
and then went on 
to work part-time as a doctor 


27:47.882 --> 27:50.285
to be able to regular pioneer 
with my husband 


27:50.285 --> 27:54.355
from 1997 till 2009. 


27:54.355 --> 27:57.425
In 2009, 
I stopped practicing medicine 


27:57.425 --> 27:59.460
to expand my ministry 


27:59.460 --> 28:01.897
in the Hindi congregation in Montreal 


28:01.897 --> 28:04.765
until I was called to Bethel in 2013.


28:04.765 --> 28:07.402
Wonderful! 
And we’re glad you’re here too. 


28:07.402 --> 28:10.372
Walter, 
share with us your experience, please?


28:10.372 --> 28:12.874
I was contacted 
in the door-to-door work 


28:12.873 --> 28:14.241
in Buffalo, New York. 


28:14.242 --> 28:17.612
I had a very good, effective Bible teacher 


28:17.612 --> 28:19.914
who was able to help 


28:19.913 --> 28:23.451
to revive in me a spiritual interest. 


28:23.452 --> 28:25.654
And I made it a formal study 


28:25.653 --> 28:27.655
my last years in medical school, 


28:27.655 --> 28:29.657
and I was baptized 


28:29.657 --> 28:32.894
not long after I graduated 
from medical school.


28:32.893 --> 28:33.895
Excellent! 


28:33.895 --> 28:34.895
Thank you. 


28:34.895 --> 28:39.000
Luis Garza from Monterrey, México, 


28:40.468 --> 28:43.170
tell us about your experience.


28:43.170 --> 28:45.740
My first contact with the truth 


28:45.740 --> 28:50.000
was after I had been practicing 
medicine for 16 years. 


28:51.545 --> 28:56.283
A patient of mine came 
with a sore throat and two magazines, 


28:56.283 --> 28:58.486
and she was a Jehovah’s Witness. 


28:58.487 --> 28:59.820
At that time, 


28:59.820 --> 29:04.725
I was having some scary experiences 


29:04.725 --> 29:07.695
where the demons were involved, 


29:07.695 --> 29:09.963
although I was not looking for them. 


29:09.963 --> 29:14.268
And I was earnestly praying 
to God for help. 


29:14.268 --> 29:18.506
I didn’t know his name, 
but I knew he existed. 


29:18.507 --> 29:21.709
And at that time, the patient came 


29:21.708 --> 29:25.045
and one of the magazines 
had on the front cover, 


29:25.045 --> 29:29.483
with big letters, 
the word “spiritism.” 


29:29.483 --> 29:31.485
So first, I said, 


29:31.485 --> 29:34.488
“I don’t want anything with that; 
I already have enough problems.” 


29:34.488 --> 29:37.758
But she said, 
“This is to protect yourself, 


29:37.758 --> 29:39.760
not to practice it.” 


29:39.760 --> 29:44.232
So I took the magazines, 
read them, and after that 


29:44.232 --> 29:48.069
a local elder 
started studying the Bible with me. 


29:48.068 --> 29:50.605
And that’s how I came into the truth.


29:50.605 --> 29:51.338
Beautiful! 


29:51.338 --> 29:55.108
And we’re so glad 
to have you serving us at Bethel. 


29:55.108 --> 29:57.245
And, Brother Harper?


29:57.245 --> 30:00.348
I requested a Bible study 


30:00.348 --> 30:04.385
immediately after finishing 
high school at age 18. 


30:04.385 --> 30:09.290
And because 
of the rigorous premedical program 


30:09.290 --> 30:13.360
that I was involved with, 
it was difficult to continue my study. 


30:13.360 --> 30:16.130
I restarted a few years later, 


30:16.130 --> 30:19.767
and my formal graduation from medical school 


30:19.767 --> 30:22.804
was one week after my baptism. 


30:22.803 --> 30:26.106
When I came to Bethel, 
I offered to come one week a month, 


30:26.107 --> 30:28.644
commuting from Atlanta, Georgia. 


30:28.643 --> 30:32.280
And so I did that for six months. 


30:32.280 --> 30:35.517
They asked me to come to Bethel full-time, 


30:35.517 --> 30:40.522
and I did that six months later 
and have been at Bethel ever since.


30:40.522 --> 30:42.524
That’s an interesting sideline


30:42.523 --> 30:45.593
—you commuted 
from Atlanta, Georgia, 


30:45.593 --> 30:46.826
for a year. 


30:46.827 --> 30:48.162
Beautiful! 


30:48.162 --> 30:49.930
And, Brother Howard, 


30:49.930 --> 30:52.167
help us with the situation 
that you were faced with 


30:52.167 --> 30:54.869
when you were introduced to the truth.


30:54.868 --> 30:59.506
When my wife and I learned the truth, 
then, immediately that changed our attitude 


30:59.507 --> 31:02.344
towards what was important in life. 


31:02.343 --> 31:05.680
And I was able to cut down 
to part-time work, 


31:05.680 --> 31:09.083
because it was just really a means 
of supporting my family then, 


31:09.083 --> 31:12.353
and auxiliary pioneer on a regular basis 


31:12.353 --> 31:16.090
and then planning 
to become a regular pioneer. 


31:16.090 --> 31:18.492
But then in 1983, 


31:18.492 --> 31:22.797
Bethel called us 
and invited us to come in 


31:22.797 --> 31:26.667
for me to serve as a medical doctor 
because there was a great need. 


31:26.667 --> 31:29.304
Within three months, we’d sold our house; 


31:29.303 --> 31:30.871
I’d left my practice; 


31:30.872 --> 31:34.000
and with our ten-year-old daughter, 
we came to Brooklyn Bethel.


31:36.577 --> 31:39.914
And today 
that daughter is a Bethel sister 


31:39.913 --> 31:42.283
married to a responsible brother. 


31:42.283 --> 31:43.751
They’re serving here together. 


31:43.752 --> 31:46.520
So the family is together in their service. 


31:46.520 --> 31:48.522
We appreciate that. 


31:48.522 --> 31:52.594
Now we want to move into an area 
that’s a little bit more sobering. 


31:52.593 --> 31:56.396
You deal with a family who are very sick, 


31:56.397 --> 31:58.399
sometimes terminally ill. 


31:58.398 --> 32:01.801
Sam Worae, 
how are you affected personally 


32:01.802 --> 32:04.205
when you are exposed to that?


32:04.205 --> 32:07.308
Well, serving as a Bethel physician 


32:07.308 --> 32:10.043
definitely is a unique privilege 


32:10.043 --> 32:12.046
but also a challenging one. 


32:12.047 --> 32:15.284
Because unlike physicians on the outside 


32:15.283 --> 32:17.918
who are detached from their patients, 


32:17.918 --> 32:19.953
we have an attachment 


32:19.953 --> 32:23.000
with our patients, 
who are also our family members. 


32:24.425 --> 32:27.362
And to even make it more difficult 


32:27.362 --> 32:31.699
is when you have to endure 
with them through terminal illnesses 


32:31.698 --> 32:34.235
or even be the one 
to give them the diagnosis


32:34.235 --> 32:36.237
—a bad diagnosis, a grave one. 


32:36.237 --> 32:38.439
And then, 


32:38.438 --> 32:42.443
when you’ve gone through 
all the difficult situations with them, 


32:42.443 --> 32:46.413
to be the one 
to pronounce them as clinically dead. 


32:46.413 --> 32:48.415
You know, 
even though we know 


32:48.415 --> 32:50.952
that we’re going to see them 
back in the new world, 


32:50.952 --> 32:54.000
it can really wrench your heart out.


32:56.290 --> 32:58.292
For me, coming to Bethel 


32:58.292 --> 33:01.762
was a complete new experience 
in medical care. 


33:01.762 --> 33:05.667
You’re treating, essentially, 
your brothers and sisters, 


33:05.667 --> 33:07.669
and they become your family. 


33:07.668 --> 33:11.071
So your emotional involvement 
and commitment


33:11.072 --> 33:14.042
—it’s much deeper. 


33:14.042 --> 33:16.710
I recall the words of my father, 


33:16.710 --> 33:20.948
he said: “A physician 
tends to treat his patients 


33:20.948 --> 33:22.950
“with his brain, or his head. 


33:22.950 --> 33:26.000
But he treats his family with heart.” 


33:27.422 --> 33:30.124
And here there’s this duality 


33:30.123 --> 33:33.493
that we have patients 
but our patients are our family


33:33.493 --> 33:35.496
—brothers and sisters—


33:35.497 --> 33:38.032
so how to deal with that? 


33:38.032 --> 33:39.800
It’s very difficult. 


33:39.800 --> 33:42.803
So one of the things that really helps me 


33:42.803 --> 33:45.540
to be able to work with the situation 


33:45.540 --> 33:50.143
is what Paul said 
at Colossians 4:14 about Luke, 


33:50.143 --> 33:52.946
and he was “the beloved physician.” 


33:52.947 --> 33:55.684
So there are two words in there, “physician”; 


33:55.683 --> 33:58.318
medical care, it was given (the medical care) 


33:58.318 --> 34:01.121
but in a loving way. 


34:01.122 --> 34:03.124
So that can be done, 


34:03.123 --> 34:06.726
and that really inspires me 
to be able to provide to my patients 


34:06.727 --> 34:11.000
the best medical care with tender affection.


34:12.633 --> 34:17.638
As physicians, 
we don’t want to see people suffering. 


34:17.638 --> 34:20.741
And whenever we’re dealing 


34:20.742 --> 34:24.845
with our dear brothers and sisters, 
it’s different; 


34:24.845 --> 34:26.613
it’s our family. 


34:26.613 --> 34:29.050
And treating our family 


34:29.050 --> 34:31.185
is more difficult.


34:31.185 --> 34:34.522
Talking to patients 
about what they are facing


34:34.522 --> 34:36.524
—pain; suffering; 


34:36.523 --> 34:40.995
and even terminal, 
incurable diseases—


34:40.995 --> 34:46.000
this makes my occupation stressful 
and emotionally charged, 


34:46.000 --> 34:50.270
especially when I have to break bad news. 


34:50.270 --> 34:55.242
But at those times, 
besieging Jehovah in prayer, 


34:55.242 --> 34:59.047
asking for strength and wisdom, 


34:59.047 --> 35:04.052
also having the support 
of my overseers at the infirmary. 


35:04.052 --> 35:07.054
They accompany me sometimes 


35:07.053 --> 35:11.758
to talk about critical issues 
with the patients, 


35:11.758 --> 35:14.928
and they pray 
even for me and for them. 


35:14.928 --> 35:18.065
So, even though it’s stressful, 


35:18.065 --> 35:21.435
I never feel overwhelmed.


35:21.435 --> 35:23.972
Very interesting. 


35:23.972 --> 35:28.642
Now, going in another direction, 
on the other side of this, 


35:28.642 --> 35:31.445
how do you stay positive 


35:31.445 --> 35:35.583
despite the negative circumstances 
that we’ve just talked about? 


35:35.583 --> 35:38.920
Walter, how do you do that?


35:38.920 --> 35:42.957
Yes, Ralph, heart disease, 
breast cancer, and prostate cancer 


35:42.957 --> 35:47.295
are still the leading causes 
of death in the Bethel family. 


35:47.295 --> 35:51.998
In such cases, 
we stay positive by sharing 


35:51.998 --> 35:56.803
our absolute confidence 
in the nearness of Jehovah’s promises. 


35:56.803 --> 36:00.106
And that tends to be 
a two-way interchange. 


36:00.107 --> 36:02.109
We attempt to encourage others, 


36:02.108 --> 36:04.111
but we are also encouraged 


36:04.112 --> 36:07.449
by many of these very mature people 
that we’re working with. 


36:07.448 --> 36:10.918
And they see things very clearly. 


36:10.918 --> 36:15.121
And we also rejoice 
because we’re able to participate 


36:15.122 --> 36:18.392
in some of the positive outcomes 
for the greater majority 


36:18.392 --> 36:21.029
of the individuals that suffer illness. 


36:21.028 --> 36:23.063
For example, the majority of our patients 


36:23.063 --> 36:25.065
with breast cancer are cured


36:25.065 --> 36:27.067
—more than 90 percent. 


36:27.067 --> 36:30.404
And in prostate cancer 
the majority are cured, 


36:30.403 --> 36:33.073
but there is also a large portion 


36:33.073 --> 36:35.175
that live a long time with their disease


36:35.175 --> 36:37.578
—a productive life with their disease. 


36:37.578 --> 36:41.148
So that helps us
—the positive outcomes. 


36:41.148 --> 36:45.051
But also with heart disease, 
we are now having much better outcomes. 


36:45.052 --> 36:49.424
People are living more productive lives 
and actually living longer. 


36:49.423 --> 36:53.426
Additionally, the Bethel environment 
is a very positive place 


36:53.427 --> 36:56.530
to develop spiritual qualities, 
such as it is. 


36:56.530 --> 36:59.033
And we get help from the Bethel table; 


36:59.033 --> 37:03.003
they deal with faith based on facts. 


37:03.003 --> 37:05.673
And it helps persons 


37:05.673 --> 37:08.175
with scientific orientation; 


37:08.175 --> 37:12.347
it helps us to know 
that our faith is very sound.


37:12.347 --> 37:13.880
I think of three factors. 


37:13.880 --> 37:15.583
The one is having a loving spouse. 


37:15.583 --> 37:17.083
Nyla is always
—and the family—


37:17.083 --> 37:21.088
always supportive of me 
being available 24 hours a day, 


37:21.088 --> 37:23.523
seven days a week to the Bethel family. 


37:23.523 --> 37:25.960
And then the love that we have as a team


37:25.960 --> 37:28.562
—our nurses and all those 
who work in the infirmary. 


37:28.562 --> 37:31.865
We have such a bond of love 
between us and the patient. 


37:31.865 --> 37:33.867
It sustains us, 


37:33.867 --> 37:36.104
and that’s a beautiful thing to see. 


37:36.103 --> 37:37.938
And then Jehovah’s spirit


37:37.938 --> 37:41.275
—the joy we get from that spirit, 
the joy we pass on to our patients, 


37:41.275 --> 37:44.045
the trust we have in Jehovah, 
the security we have. 


37:44.045 --> 37:46.547
And that powerful force
—the greatest thing in the universe—


37:46.547 --> 37:49.000
helps me through 
as it does the patients.


37:50.050 --> 37:53.353
And I think he speaks for all of you 
when he says he really appreciates 


37:53.353 --> 37:58.458
the support the nurses, the PCAs, 
and all of the staff give you. 


37:58.458 --> 38:00.226
I’ve heard you comment on that many times. 


38:00.227 --> 38:01.762
Thank you, Brother Jack. 


38:01.762 --> 38:04.099
Let’s go to Brother Harper, 


38:04.098 --> 38:06.100
how would you respond to this


38:06.100 --> 38:09.737
—keeping positive in spite 
of the things you have to deal with?


38:09.737 --> 38:12.807
I focus on the positive


38:12.807 --> 38:15.944
—the things that we can do for the patient 


38:15.943 --> 38:19.213
to make them have a better quality of life. 


38:19.213 --> 38:22.850
And that gives us some personal satisfaction. 


38:22.850 --> 38:26.987
The other thing 
is that we concentrate on the positive 


38:26.987 --> 38:29.590
by means of what the Scriptures tell us 


38:29.590 --> 38:32.627
about the fact that all 
of these things are only temporary. 


38:32.627 --> 38:35.930
I look at Jesus. 


38:35.930 --> 38:40.500
Even though he was about to raise Lazarus 


38:40.500 --> 38:42.670
and he knew what he was going to do, 


38:42.670 --> 38:45.338
he still broke out crying. 


38:45.338 --> 38:47.106
Why did he do that? 


38:47.107 --> 38:49.577
Because he felt the pain 


38:49.577 --> 38:51.579
that they were enduring, 
and we feel it too. 


38:51.578 --> 38:53.613
So it’s OK to cry. 


38:53.613 --> 38:56.816
But we know that the end result 


38:56.817 --> 38:59.000
will be for the benefit of everybody.


39:00.120 --> 39:01.755
Hope. 


39:01.755 --> 39:04.792
I think just the fact that I remember 


39:04.792 --> 39:07.194
that this situation is temporary


39:07.193 --> 39:09.396
—the illness of the friend. 


39:09.397 --> 39:11.632
And one verse that I really, really like 


39:11.632 --> 39:16.004
is Revelation 21:4, where, at the end, 


39:16.003 --> 39:19.906
it says that all things have passed away. 


39:19.907 --> 39:22.377
So we won’t remember any of those things. 


39:22.377 --> 39:24.379
Although it’s hard right now, 


39:24.378 --> 39:27.000
it’s not something 
we will live with in the future.


39:28.448 --> 39:30.985
The thing that really helps me a great deal 


39:30.985 --> 39:35.990
is to see the faith 
and the love for Jehovah in patients 


39:35.990 --> 39:41.028
who have a serious, 
very painful terminal illness. 


39:41.028 --> 39:45.833
I see that they love Jehovah, 
and that’s crystal clear like a diamond


39:45.833 --> 39:49.703
—that love and faith in Jehovah. 


39:49.703 --> 39:54.541
And it really strengthens my faith, 
no matter how much they’re suffering. 


39:54.542 --> 39:57.545
And they know 
that they’re going to be resurrected. 


39:57.545 --> 39:59.947
There’s no doubt whatsoever in their minds 


39:59.947 --> 40:04.185
that in the words of Hosea 13:14: 


40:04.185 --> 40:06.753
“Where are your stings, O Death?” 


40:06.753 --> 40:10.958
There was one sister, a long-time missionary 


40:10.958 --> 40:15.595
who was dying of a very painful cancer


40:15.595 --> 40:17.765
—rapidly progressive cancer—


40:17.765 --> 40:20.400
and she’d been healthy 
all her life until then, 


40:20.400 --> 40:23.470
and she had a complete faith 
in the resurrection. 


40:23.470 --> 40:28.475
And one of her last expressions was: 


40:28.475 --> 40:32.580
“I never died before. 
I didn’t know it’d be so hard.” 


40:32.580 --> 40:34.715
But she knew what was coming after that.


40:34.715 --> 40:37.818
That’s a touching experience. 


40:37.818 --> 40:39.186
Last question: 


40:39.187 --> 40:43.057
Can you share your comments 
about looking forward to the time 


40:43.057 --> 40:47.127
when you’ll no longer have your jobs? 


40:47.127 --> 40:49.930
In the new world, we won’t need this work. 


40:49.930 --> 40:52.000
What do you think about that, Worae?


40:53.467 --> 40:55.469
Well, I particularly look forward, Ralph, 


40:55.468 --> 40:59.540
to a time that I wouldn’t have
to be woken up in the night,


40:59.540 --> 41:04.445
you know, 
to care for dear ones who are in pain. 


41:04.445 --> 41:07.582
I can have the time to enjoy 


41:07.582 --> 41:10.050
time with my dear wife in the new world 


41:10.050 --> 41:12.887
and pursue skills such as drawing, painting, 


41:12.887 --> 41:15.089
designing beautiful buildings. 


41:15.088 --> 41:17.725
And, you know, enjoying the art and music 


41:17.725 --> 41:19.727
into eternity with my wife. 


41:19.727 --> 41:22.229
And I look forward very much to that. 


41:22.228 --> 41:24.898
So I can easily let this go.


41:24.898 --> 41:26.900
For several years 


41:26.900 --> 41:30.270
Worae has been asking 
to work in the Art Department, 


41:30.270 --> 41:32.507
so you’ll have your day.


41:32.507 --> 41:35.000
It’s a promise.


41:36.310 --> 41:41.682
Brother Carleton, please, 
new world, no more physician?


41:41.682 --> 41:43.850
That will be a wonderful day! 


41:43.850 --> 41:46.653
The only thing I look forward to is those 
who we haven’t been able to help, 


41:46.653 --> 41:48.521
then I can welcome them back. 


41:48.522 --> 41:50.424
I’ll be young, and they’ll be young. 


41:50.423 --> 41:52.125
And that’ll be a beautiful time. 


41:52.125 --> 41:54.762
But the peace and security 
that the world will hold


41:54.762 --> 41:57.064
—the creation, the sounds of birds, 


41:57.063 --> 42:00.000
nothing man-made interfering with noises. 


42:00.000 --> 42:03.770
But seeing the animals play 
and learning about the plants 


42:03.770 --> 42:08.000
and having my own garden 
with the family together doing these things.


42:09.377 --> 42:11.379
Sister Anne Marie?


42:11.378 --> 42:15.381
We are often asked 
to imagine ourselves in the new system. 


42:15.382 --> 42:20.154
And for me, it’s never been 
like a specific house or a place, 


42:20.153 --> 42:24.791
but it’s always been to know 
that everybody wakes up in the morning, 


42:24.792 --> 42:27.629
they’re happy, they don’t have any pain, 


42:27.628 --> 42:30.663
they’re ready for a full day of activity. 


42:30.663 --> 42:35.168
For me, that’s the new system, 
and I’m ready to go there.


42:35.168 --> 42:36.403
Thank you, 


42:36.403 --> 42:40.773
and Enrique Corvalan, please?


42:40.773 --> 42:44.010
Here on this side of life, 


42:44.010 --> 42:48.148
we can say we treat 


42:48.148 --> 42:50.850
and take care of our friends. 


42:50.850 --> 42:54.087
It could be an illness, severe or minor. 


42:54.087 --> 42:58.959
But the end is all death. 


42:58.958 --> 43:02.796
So in the new system, 
what I’m looking for 


43:02.797 --> 43:05.299
is that there’s not going to be 
any illness or diseases. 


43:05.298 --> 43:07.300
And on top of that, 


43:07.300 --> 43:10.870
we will be able to see 
the ones who we have left, 


43:10.870 --> 43:13.940
because they’ve gone into death, 
come back


43:13.940 --> 43:17.778
—not leaving but coming back, 
coming back to life. 


43:17.778 --> 43:20.080
So I’m looking forward 
to being able to be, 


43:20.080 --> 43:22.783
eventually, 
one of the reception committee. 


43:22.783 --> 43:27.655
Yeah, waking and receiving 
those brothers and sisters 


43:27.655 --> 43:29.657
and family members, 
dear family members, 


43:29.657 --> 43:31.859
who we have lost in death.


43:31.858 --> 43:33.000
Beautiful, beautiful thought. 


43:34.562 --> 43:37.564
Walter, no more doctoring, 


43:37.563 --> 43:40.100
new world, what do you say?


43:40.100 --> 43:42.903
I don’t think I’ll have 
any problem with that at all. 


43:42.903 --> 43:47.073
In fact, we have 
so many beautiful brothers and sisters 


43:47.073 --> 43:50.276
that Jehovah has created 
with minds that we’ll now be able 


43:50.277 --> 43:53.480
to employ them in more useful activities. 


43:53.480 --> 43:56.583
But I think for me the most important thing, 


43:56.583 --> 44:00.620
I think, would be that in the new system 


44:00.620 --> 44:05.625
I’ll be able to learn 
and associate more with Jehovah 


44:05.625 --> 44:08.262
without the distractions we have today. 


44:08.262 --> 44:10.697
And I think that’s going 
to be a marvelous hope 


44:10.697 --> 44:14.369
to open up for everyone, 
and I certainly look forward to that.


44:14.368 --> 44:16.103
Profound thought. 
Thank you. 


44:16.103 --> 44:20.040
And, dear Brother Luis Garza?


44:20.040 --> 44:23.110
I will be extremely happy to give up 


44:23.110 --> 44:25.512
the practice of medicine in the new world. 


44:25.512 --> 44:27.547
With all these promises 


44:27.547 --> 44:31.785
that Jehovah has made for us, 


44:31.785 --> 44:35.088
we will not need the practice of medicine.


44:35.088 --> 44:36.856
Thank you. 


44:36.857 --> 44:38.759
And, James Harper?


44:38.758 --> 44:43.096
I look so forward 
to the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises. 


44:43.097 --> 44:44.264
I just can’t wait. 


44:44.263 --> 44:47.935
And, actually, 
I look forward to giving up this assignment. 


44:47.935 --> 44:52.005
But many people in the past have said, 
“Well, you won’t have a job.” 


44:52.005 --> 44:56.377
I’m not concerned 
because Jehovah won’t let me go unemployed. 


44:56.377 --> 45:00.847
He’ll give me a very interesting 
and challenging assignment, I’m sure.


45:00.847 --> 45:03.084
Very good, thank you. 


45:03.083 --> 45:04.685
And, Brother Howard?


45:04.685 --> 45:09.523
Peace, nature, animals, music, 


45:09.523 --> 45:14.395
happy people all loving Jehovah 
and loved by him 


45:14.395 --> 45:16.797
working together to serve him. 


45:16.797 --> 45:19.967
I just want to be there.


45:19.967 --> 45:22.000
And, Sister Olga Manson?


45:23.370 --> 45:26.140
When Jesus was on earth, 


45:26.140 --> 45:30.943
he did powerful works of curing the sick 


45:30.943 --> 45:33.380
and resurrecting the dead. 


45:33.380 --> 45:36.483
And to me, that is an evidence 


45:36.483 --> 45:38.951
that Jehovah and Jesus 


45:38.952 --> 45:41.722
are very interested in our health 


45:41.722 --> 45:46.694
and also that they are 
better doctors than I could ever be. 


45:46.693 --> 45:50.000
So I can’t wait to be out of a job.


45:51.932 --> 45:55.802
And I think every one of us 
agrees with every one of you. 


45:55.802 --> 45:58.705
We yearn for the day 
when you will not be doctors. 


45:58.705 --> 46:00.307
Yeah. 


46:00.307 --> 46:03.044
But in the meantime, 
we want to thank you, 


46:03.043 --> 46:05.645
not just for your expressions today 


46:05.645 --> 46:09.850
but for your dedicated view 
of your sacred service 


46:09.850 --> 46:12.787
at Bethel as physicians. 


46:12.787 --> 46:16.055
In fact, we’re grateful 
for the entire medical staff. 


46:16.055 --> 46:18.458
And I know when we talked about this before, 


46:18.458 --> 46:20.460
you dear folks in your comments 


46:20.460 --> 46:24.665
applauded those who 
support you in your work.


46:24.665 --> 46:27.802
We appreciate that you’re willing 
to use your training, 


46:27.802 --> 46:31.872
not for selfish pursuits 
but for Kingdom interests. 


46:31.872 --> 46:34.675
But even more than that, 
we appreciate 


46:34.675 --> 46:36.843
what we’ve seen here among you, 


46:36.843 --> 46:39.646
and that’s your deep spirituality. 


46:39.647 --> 46:44.117
It’s so evident, and we thank you for that. 


46:44.117 --> 46:48.122
So you’ve given not only your skills 
but as Paul mentions 


46:48.122 --> 46:50.890
at 1 Thessalonians 2:8, 


46:50.890 --> 46:54.928
you remember there, 
he says we’ve given ‘our very souls.’ 


46:54.928 --> 46:57.130
And that’s what you dear folks have done. 


46:57.130 --> 47:00.800
Most of all, who do you think we thank? 


47:00.800 --> 47:02.068
Jehovah. 


47:02.068 --> 47:03.403
Why? 


47:03.403 --> 47:06.038
Because he cares for faithful ones 


47:06.038 --> 47:10.510
and he strengthens such ones, 
including yourselves. 


47:10.510 --> 47:15.182
I’d like to read what Paul said 
in one of his letters to a congregation. 


47:15.182 --> 47:17.184
I’d like for you dear folks to hear it 


47:17.183 --> 47:22.355
in the context of all of us 
saying this about you: 


47:22.355 --> 47:26.927
“We always thank God 
when we mention all of you . . . , 


47:26.927 --> 47:30.464
“for we continually remember 
your faithful work, 


47:30.463 --> 47:33.866
your loving labor, 
and your endurance.” 


47:33.867 --> 47:36.169
And all of us yearn for the time


47:36.168 --> 47:39.740
when “no resident” in the entire earth 


47:39.740 --> 47:41.942
“will say: ‘I am sick.’” 


47:41.942 --> 47:44.000
Thank you very much.


47:54.622 --> 47:58.192
That was indeed a unique interview. 


47:58.192 --> 48:01.862
And we appreciate their love for Jehovah 


48:01.862 --> 48:04.665
and their love for their fellow servants 


48:04.665 --> 48:08.102
and the loving way 
in which they use their talents. 


48:08.102 --> 48:11.639
It’s also unique in that they 


48:11.638 --> 48:15.175
will all lose their jobs in the near future. 


48:15.175 --> 48:18.000
They seem to be happy for that though. 


48:19.980 --> 48:23.217
I would just like to mention 
that this interview 


48:23.217 --> 48:28.189
was featuring 
the United States branch medical provisions. 


48:28.188 --> 48:31.658
While it’s true 
that all branches around the world 


48:31.658 --> 48:33.960
have arrangements in place to care 


48:33.960 --> 48:37.130
for their Bethel families’ medical needs, 


48:37.130 --> 48:39.833
the doctors interviewed just now 


48:39.833 --> 48:43.536
take care of over 4,500 members 


48:43.537 --> 48:46.172
of the Bethel family 
here in the United States, 


48:46.172 --> 48:51.177
including long-term members of the family 


48:51.177 --> 48:54.214
and temporary volunteers. 


48:54.213 --> 48:58.685
The cost to provide 
outside doctor’s care for that many people 


48:58.685 --> 49:01.788
would be very, very expensive, 


49:01.788 --> 49:07.293
especially since medical costs 
in the United States are so high. 


49:07.293 --> 49:09.495
However, these doctors just interviewed 


49:09.495 --> 49:13.267
receive the same small monthly allowance 


49:13.267 --> 49:17.737
as all other Bethel family members. 


49:17.737 --> 49:20.974
This has saved hundreds 
of thousands of dollars 


49:20.973 --> 49:23.876
of contributed funds each year. 


49:23.877 --> 49:28.082
So we would like to thank 
the doctors for their fine spirit 


49:28.082 --> 49:31.385
and all of those working with the infirmaries 


49:31.385 --> 49:33.920
for their skill and efficiency. 


49:33.920 --> 49:38.925
But above all, we thank them 
for their warm brotherly affection 


49:38.925 --> 49:43.930
when we are often feeling our worst. 


49:43.930 --> 49:48.268
You’re good medical caregivers, 


49:48.268 --> 49:53.873
and we want you to know 
that you do good work. 


49:53.873 --> 49:56.943
You’re definitely needed


49:56.943 --> 49:59.000
—for now. 


50:02.382 --> 50:05.919
Oh, by the way, 


50:05.918 --> 50:10.923
if any of these doctors or any other doctor 


50:10.923 --> 50:15.228
should ask you 
to please stick out your tongue, 


50:15.228 --> 50:17.196
don’t try to swallow it. 


50:17.197 --> 50:19.199
Stick it out! 


50:19.198 --> 50:21.601
They’re just trying to help us, 


50:21.602 --> 50:24.000
even though you’re not in Tibet.


50:27.573 --> 50:30.000
Well, it’s time for you to stand


50:32.745 --> 50:34.982
—that is, if you’re able—


50:34.982 --> 50:38.252
and “sing out joyfully” to Jehovah. 


50:38.252 --> 50:41.020
Since none of you have the new songbook 


50:41.020 --> 50:43.423
with this new numbering system, 


50:43.423 --> 50:45.458
we’re going to use the song numbers 


50:45.458 --> 50:49.261
from the songbook 
you currently have access to. 


50:49.262 --> 50:51.297
It is one of our new songs. 


50:51.297 --> 50:56.302
The number we have been using 
is song number 152, 


50:56.302 --> 51:01.000
“Our Strength, Our Hope, Our Confidence.”


54:15.535 --> 54:17.670
We now will enjoy a number of talks 


54:17.670 --> 54:19.805
from members of the Governing Body. 


54:19.805 --> 54:23.042
Brother David Splane is ready 
to present his talk, 


54:23.042 --> 54:26.512
“Trust in Jehovah and Do What Is Good.” 


54:26.512 --> 54:28.982
Brother Splane, our ears are ready 


54:28.982 --> 54:32.000
to hear what your tongue has to say.


54:34.153 --> 54:37.000
We’ll see.


54:40.393 --> 54:44.363
Jehovah created all of us 


54:44.363 --> 54:48.066
with some remarkable abilities. 


54:48.067 --> 54:52.272
He gave us the ability to solve problems 


54:52.272 --> 54:54.707
and plan for the future, 


54:54.707 --> 54:59.712
and he also gave us 
the ability to carry out our plans. 


54:59.712 --> 55:03.884
Now, how does he want 
us to use our abilities? 


55:03.883 --> 55:06.018
To benefit others. 


55:06.018 --> 55:08.020
Why? 


55:08.020 --> 55:12.958
Because he knows that when we 
are serving others, we’re happy. 


55:12.958 --> 55:14.960
God loves us, 


55:14.960 --> 55:17.963
and he wants us to be happy.


55:17.963 --> 55:19.965
Now, at the same time, 


55:19.965 --> 55:24.003
Jehovah realizes 
that we all have limitations. 


55:24.003 --> 55:28.875
He realizes it, 
but sometimes we don’t. 


55:28.875 --> 55:33.847
And so all of us have to learn 
to set reasonable goals for ourselves 


55:33.847 --> 55:38.685
and then to rejoice, to be happy, 
when we have achieved these goals. 


55:38.685 --> 55:41.722
Now, some really have to learn that. 


55:41.722 --> 55:45.892
They’re never satisfied; 
they never have enough money; 


55:45.892 --> 55:48.729
they never have enough service privileges; 


55:48.728 --> 55:51.030
they always want more, more, more. 


55:51.030 --> 55:52.798
And what’s the result? 


55:52.798 --> 55:54.800
They’re never happy. 


55:54.800 --> 55:57.837
We have to be able to rejoice 


55:57.837 --> 56:00.174
over what we can do 


56:00.173 --> 56:04.543
and not fret over what we cannot do. 


56:04.543 --> 56:08.648
Now, if our goals 
are in line with Jehovah’s purpose, 


56:08.648 --> 56:11.383
we can be sure that he will back us up.


56:11.383 --> 56:15.288
In fact, the writer of the 37th Psalm 
was convinced of this. 


56:15.288 --> 56:18.758
Here’s a man who had 
personal experience with Jehovah, 


56:18.758 --> 56:21.326
and he knew how Jehovah would back him up 


56:21.327 --> 56:23.530
if he put his trust in Him. 


56:23.530 --> 56:28.968
Let’s read Psalm 37:3. 


56:28.968 --> 56:32.238
And here we see that the writer 


56:32.238 --> 56:36.541
is speaking to us from personal experience. 


56:36.542 --> 56:38.545
He says: 


56:38.545 --> 56:41.647
“Trust in Jehovah 


56:41.647 --> 56:45.285
and do what is good.” 


56:45.285 --> 56:47.720
Well, that’s the theme of this talk, 
isn’t it? 


56:47.720 --> 56:52.000
“Reside in the earth, 
and act with faithfulness.” 


56:54.527 --> 56:58.999
The 37th Psalm 
was written by David of Bethlehem 


56:58.998 --> 57:01.566
and apparently near the end of his life, 


57:01.567 --> 57:03.737
because he wrote: 


57:03.737 --> 57:08.000
“I was once young and now I am old.” 


57:10.110 --> 57:14.113
Now, David was only 70 when he died, 


57:14.113 --> 57:18.183
so I think some of us 
would object to that characterization. 


57:18.183 --> 57:23.000
I can just about hear Brother Herd say, 
“Who are you calling old? 


57:24.023 --> 57:28.561
We can still hear 
crickets chirping and birds singing.” 


57:28.562 --> 57:33.099
But let’s say that David 
was speaking from his own experience 


57:33.098 --> 57:38.103
and that he’s sharing his experience 
as a mature man with us; 


57:38.103 --> 57:40.873
he wants us to benefit from the things 


57:40.873 --> 57:44.076
that happened to him in his lifetime. 


57:44.077 --> 57:46.745
And what a life David led! 


57:46.745 --> 57:49.482
So for the next few minutes, 
we’re going to review 


57:49.482 --> 57:51.750
a few highlights of David’s life 


57:51.750 --> 57:55.588
and we’re going to see how David’s life 


57:55.588 --> 57:59.158
was really directed by his trust in Jehovah. 


57:59.158 --> 58:02.128
Jehovah God was guiding him 
every step of the way, 


58:02.128 --> 58:05.498
and it’s a real benefit for us.


58:05.498 --> 58:09.901
Now, do you realize 
that when David was born, 


58:09.902 --> 58:13.039
Saul had been reigning over Israel 


58:13.038 --> 58:16.041
for ten years already? 


58:16.042 --> 58:18.845
But Jehovah wasn’t pleased with Saul. 


58:18.845 --> 58:20.880
In fact, much earlier, 


58:20.880 --> 58:23.983
He had sent the prophet Samuel 
to tell the king: 


58:23.983 --> 58:28.588
“Jehovah will find 
a man agreeable to his heart, 


58:28.588 --> 58:33.593
“and Jehovah will commission him 
as a leader over his people, 


58:33.593 --> 58:38.965
because you did not obey 
what Jehovah commanded you.” 


58:38.965 --> 58:42.035
Now, that was Jehovah’s promise to Saul, 


58:42.035 --> 58:45.070
but He didn’t carry it out right away; 


58:45.070 --> 58:48.908
He didn’t provide 
for Saul’s replacement right away. 


58:48.908 --> 58:52.945
In fact, 
it was probably more than a quarter century 


58:52.945 --> 58:57.650
before David was anointed 
as the future king of Israel. 


58:57.650 --> 59:02.455
And maybe Saul thought that Jehovah 
had forgotten all about replacing him, 


59:02.455 --> 59:06.792
but Jehovah hadn’t, 
and David was anointed.


59:06.792 --> 59:10.230
Now, 
it was some time after that 


59:10.230 --> 59:14.733
that a Philistine from Gath, 
the giant Goliath, 


59:14.733 --> 59:17.736
challenged the battle lines 
of the living God: 


59:17.737 --> 59:22.175
‘Choose for yourselves a man 
that he might fight with me.’ 


59:22.175 --> 59:26.178
Young David was visiting the camp, 
and he overheard this. 


59:26.178 --> 59:29.615
And he couldn’t understand 
why none of the Israelite soldiers 


59:29.615 --> 59:31.952
were willing to take up the challenge, 


59:31.952 --> 59:34.154
and so he expressed his concern. 


59:34.153 --> 59:37.190
And his oldest brother, Eliab, 


59:37.190 --> 59:39.558
heard what David was saying, 


59:39.558 --> 59:42.328
and he rebuked his younger brother. 


59:42.328 --> 59:45.931
Well, older brothers 
have a tendency of doing that, don’t they? 


59:45.932 --> 59:51.000
We read about the conversation 
in 1 Samuel chapter 17, 


59:53.773 --> 59:57.000
and we’re going to make a point with this. 


59:59.078 --> 1:00:11.000
1 Samuel 17:28, 29: 


1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:17.830
“When his oldest brother Eliab 
heard him speak to the men, 


1:00:17.830 --> 1:00:20.400
“he became angry with David and said: 


1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:22.402
“‘Why have you come down? 


1:00:22.402 --> 1:00:25.839
“‘And with whom did you leave 
those few sheep in the wilderness? 


1:00:25.838 --> 1:00:30.843
“‘I well know your presumptuousness 
and the bad intentions of your heart; 


1:00:30.843 --> 1:00:34.646
“you came down just to see the battle.’ 


1:00:34.647 --> 1:00:38.484
“To this David said: 
‘What have I done now? 


1:00:38.483 --> 1:00:41.553
I was only asking a question!’” 


1:00:41.553 --> 1:00:44.556
Isn’t the wording of that realistic? 


1:00:44.557 --> 1:00:48.000
Isn’t that what you would hear 
in your own family?


1:00:49.762 --> 1:00:53.265
Now, what was the problem with Eliab? 


1:00:53.265 --> 1:00:57.503
He was viewing David according to the flesh. 


1:00:57.503 --> 1:01:02.408
To Eliab, 
David was still his pesky little brother, 


1:01:02.408 --> 1:01:04.410
but he should have known better. 


1:01:04.410 --> 1:01:06.145
Why? 


1:01:06.145 --> 1:01:09.382
Because Eliab had been present earlier 


1:01:09.382 --> 1:01:13.854
when Samuel had anointed David 
as the future king of Israel. 


1:01:13.853 --> 1:01:16.188
Now, 
the current king of Israel wasn’t willing 


1:01:16.188 --> 1:01:19.758
to take up the challenge 
that Goliath threw out. 


1:01:19.758 --> 1:01:22.995
So wasn’t it only reasonable 
that the next in line to the throne 


1:01:22.995 --> 1:01:24.997
should take up the challenge? 


1:01:24.997 --> 1:01:28.935
There was nothing presumptuous 
about what David was doing. 


1:01:28.935 --> 1:01:32.472
Now picture this: 
Here you have, on the one hand


1:01:32.472 --> 1:01:35.207
—David—
a shepherd, 


1:01:35.207 --> 1:01:37.877
probably in his teens and, 


1:01:37.877 --> 1:01:40.312
on the other


1:01:40.312 --> 1:01:42.649
—Saul—
a seasoned warrior, 


1:01:42.648 --> 1:01:45.485
probably in his late 60’s. 


1:01:45.485 --> 1:01:47.153
And we have to ask, 


1:01:47.153 --> 1:01:51.000
What did David have that Saul was lacking? 


1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:56.795
Trust
—trust in Jehovah. 


1:01:56.795 --> 1:02:00.933
David was going to work 
with Jehovah on this assignment, 


1:02:00.933 --> 1:02:04.170
but David realized 
that trust alone was not enough. 


1:02:04.170 --> 1:02:07.573
You could trust that Jehovah would raise up 
someone else to fight Goliath, 


1:02:07.573 --> 1:02:09.175
but that wouldn’t do any good. 


1:02:09.175 --> 1:02:11.177
David wanted to trust in Jehovah, 


1:02:11.177 --> 1:02:14.047
but he also wanted to do something about it


1:02:14.047 --> 1:02:17.015
—to do something good. 


1:02:17.015 --> 1:02:21.820
But didn’t David run the risk 
of being killed by Goliath? 


1:02:21.820 --> 1:02:23.823
Not a chance. 


1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:25.825
Why? 


1:02:25.825 --> 1:02:30.095
Because Jehovah had had David anointed 


1:02:30.095 --> 1:02:32.232
to rule over Israel 


1:02:32.232 --> 1:02:35.200
and David hadn’t become king yet. 


1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:38.872
Do you think 
that an uncircumcised Philistine like Goliath 


1:02:38.872 --> 1:02:43.109
could stand in the way 
of Jehovah fulfilling His purpose? 


1:02:43.108 --> 1:02:44.476
Never! 


1:02:44.477 --> 1:02:46.479
Never would that happen. 


1:02:46.478 --> 1:02:50.883
Neither Goliath nor Saul nor anyone else 


1:02:50.883 --> 1:02:54.686
was going to prevent David 
from becoming the king. 


1:02:54.687 --> 1:02:59.725
He would live, 
as long as he was faithful to Jehovah. 


1:02:59.725 --> 1:03:03.797
David had complete trust in Jehovah, 


1:03:03.797 --> 1:03:06.099
and his trust was rewarded.


1:03:06.098 --> 1:03:09.135
So he was again 
drawing on personal experience. 


1:03:09.135 --> 1:03:11.837
If we turn back to Psalm 37, 


1:03:11.837 --> 1:03:15.174
we’ll be reading quite a bit 
from Psalm 37 now, 


1:03:15.173 --> 1:03:17.710
so you can keep your Bibles open there. 


1:03:17.710 --> 1:03:20.480
He’s again drawing on personal experience 


1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:23.748
when he writes what we read in verse 5. 


1:03:23.748 --> 1:03:26.000
So that’s Psalm 37:5: 


1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:30.990
“Commit your way to Jehovah; 


1:03:30.990 --> 1:03:33.325
“rely on him, 


1:03:33.325 --> 1:03:37.330
and he will act in your behalf.” 


1:03:37.330 --> 1:03:42.335
Now, the Philistines were 
sworn enemies of Israel, 


1:03:42.335 --> 1:03:45.470
but David had enemies closer to home. 


1:03:45.470 --> 1:03:48.273
And he could have become embittered 


1:03:48.273 --> 1:03:51.176
to realize that intimate associates of his 


1:03:51.177 --> 1:03:54.314
and even family members had betrayed him. 


1:03:54.313 --> 1:03:57.316
But, on the whole, 
David was a spiritual man. 


1:03:57.317 --> 1:03:59.152
And we might ask, 


1:03:59.152 --> 1:04:02.722
How does a spiritual man handle betrayal? 


1:04:02.722 --> 1:04:05.759
Notice verse 8. 


1:04:05.758 --> 1:04:07.426
He says: 


1:04:07.427 --> 1:04:12.030
“Let go of anger and abandon rage; 


1:04:12.030 --> 1:04:18.503
do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” 


1:04:18.503 --> 1:04:21.940
Now, why could David adopt this attitude 


1:04:21.940 --> 1:04:24.310
when he was being betrayed? 


1:04:24.310 --> 1:04:28.613
He had a warm personal relationship 
with Jehovah God; 


1:04:28.613 --> 1:04:30.816
he knew his God. 


1:04:30.817 --> 1:04:33.552
He knew that Jehovah hears everything; 


1:04:33.552 --> 1:04:35.555
He sees everything. 


1:04:35.555 --> 1:04:37.890
He knew that God cares. 


1:04:37.890 --> 1:04:41.000
And notice Psalm 37:18. 


1:04:42.728 --> 1:04:44.763
David writes: 


1:04:44.763 --> 1:04:48.800
“Jehovah is aware 
of what the blameless go through.” 


1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:50.803
Isn’t that reassuring? 


1:04:50.803 --> 1:04:54.673
“And their inheritance will last forever.”


1:04:54.673 --> 1:04:57.310
Now, David was a strong man, 


1:04:57.310 --> 1:04:59.545
a valiant warrior. 


1:04:59.545 --> 1:05:02.515
We recall when David would return from battle 


1:05:02.515 --> 1:05:04.550
that the women would sing: 


1:05:04.550 --> 1:05:06.552
‘Saul has killed his thousands, 


1:05:06.552 --> 1:05:10.690
David his tens of thousands.’ 


1:05:10.690 --> 1:05:15.460
But David did not rely 
on his military prowess 


1:05:15.460 --> 1:05:17.697
in dealing with his enemies


1:05:17.697 --> 1:05:19.965
—he turned to Jehovah. 


1:05:19.965 --> 1:05:24.000
And we find evidence of that 
in verses 12 and 13 of the 37th Psalm. 


1:05:25.437 --> 1:05:27.440
David writes: 


1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.010
“The wicked man plots against the righteous; 


1:05:31.010 --> 1:05:33.778
“he grinds his teeth at him. 


1:05:33.778 --> 1:05:37.750
“But Jehovah will laugh at him, 


1:05:37.750 --> 1:05:41.253
for He knows that his day will come.” 


1:05:41.253 --> 1:05:45.256
So there’s always this sense with David 
that whatever is happening, 


1:05:45.257 --> 1:05:48.494
Jehovah sees it; 
Jehovah is observing it, 


1:05:48.493 --> 1:05:52.130
and Jehovah is going to step in in due time


1:05:52.130 --> 1:05:54.133
—very encouraging. 


1:05:54.133 --> 1:05:55.668
And so often in the Psalms— 


1:05:55.668 --> 1:05:57.836
We’ve been reading in the Psalms now 
in our Bible reading, 


1:05:57.837 --> 1:06:00.505
and haven’t you noticed 
so often in the Psalms 


1:06:00.505 --> 1:06:02.708
that this strong man, 


1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:05.110
this rugged man
—David—


1:06:05.110 --> 1:06:08.013
beseeches Jehovah to give him 


1:06:08.013 --> 1:06:13.885
a way of escape from his enemies? 


1:06:13.885 --> 1:06:16.155
Now, a lot of people in this country 


1:06:16.155 --> 1:06:19.692
would think that that was a coward’s act. 


1:06:19.692 --> 1:06:22.562
In this country, 
there are so many people who say: 


1:06:22.562 --> 1:06:25.430
“Don’t give in.
Don’t back down. 


1:06:25.430 --> 1:06:27.967
“Stand your ground. 
Buy a weapon. 


1:06:27.967 --> 1:06:30.269
Keep it by your bedside.” 


1:06:30.268 --> 1:06:32.303
Not David


1:06:32.303 --> 1:06:34.440
—David took comfort 


1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:38.143
in what we read 
in verse 28 of Psalm 37: 


1:06:38.143 --> 1:06:41.713
“Jehovah loves justice.” 


1:06:41.713 --> 1:06:45.000
So he placed his case before Jehovah God.


1:06:46.918 --> 1:06:51.923
David had to struggle with his conscience 
on more than one occasion. 


1:06:51.923 --> 1:06:56.595
Do you remember what happened 
when David was running away from Saul 


1:06:56.595 --> 1:06:59.498
and he came to Ahimelech the priest? 


1:06:59.498 --> 1:07:02.935
Now, Ahimelech didn’t know 
that David was a fugitive, 


1:07:02.935 --> 1:07:06.538
and David wasn’t interested 
in letting him know that. 


1:07:06.538 --> 1:07:08.673
Instead, he told the priest: 


1:07:08.673 --> 1:07:12.545
“The king instructed me to do something, 
but he said, 


1:07:12.545 --> 1:07:15.447
“‘Do not let anyone know anything 
about the mission 


1:07:15.447 --> 1:07:17.717
on which I am sending you.’” 


1:07:17.717 --> 1:07:20.552
Well, that wasn’t true. 


1:07:20.552 --> 1:07:24.190
Then David asked for bread for his men, 


1:07:24.190 --> 1:07:28.193
and the priest was happy 
to give him bread and provisions. 


1:07:28.193 --> 1:07:32.931
Saul found out about it, 
and he was furious. 


1:07:32.932 --> 1:07:36.635
He directed that Ahimelech 
and his household 


1:07:36.635 --> 1:07:38.637
be put to death 


1:07:38.637 --> 1:07:44.000
and, in all, 85 priests were slaughtered. 


1:07:45.110 --> 1:07:47.378
Ahimelech was deceived. 


1:07:47.378 --> 1:07:51.050
He thought he was helping 
an emissary of King Saul. 


1:07:51.050 --> 1:07:53.818
Do you think he 
would have been so willing to help 


1:07:53.818 --> 1:07:56.521
if he had known the true situation? 


1:07:56.522 --> 1:07:58.590
Maybe not. 


1:07:58.590 --> 1:08:01.893
When those 85 priests are resurrected, 


1:08:01.893 --> 1:08:05.000
I think David is going to have 
a little explaining to do.


1:08:06.665 --> 1:08:09.835
Well, was David’s conscience stricken? 


1:08:09.835 --> 1:08:12.170
You better believe it. 


1:08:12.170 --> 1:08:15.875
He told Ahimelech’s only surviving son: 


1:08:15.875 --> 1:08:18.877
“I am personally responsible 


1:08:18.877 --> 1:08:22.915
for the death of everyone 
in your father’s house.” 


1:08:22.915 --> 1:08:24.917
How do you live with that? 


1:08:24.917 --> 1:08:30.000
How do you live with being responsible 
for the death of so many people? 


1:08:31.623 --> 1:08:34.260
What could David do? 


1:08:34.260 --> 1:08:37.328
What was done was done. 


1:08:37.328 --> 1:08:39.931
He couldn’t change the past. 


1:08:39.932 --> 1:08:43.569
Would he become paralyzed with guilt 


1:08:43.568 --> 1:08:47.138
or overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness 


1:08:47.138 --> 1:08:50.108
and become inactive in Jehovah’s service? 


1:08:50.108 --> 1:08:52.110
Not David. 


1:08:52.110 --> 1:08:56.482
What he could do was protect 
the last remaining member 


1:08:56.482 --> 1:08:58.517
of the house of Ahimelech, 


1:08:58.517 --> 1:09:01.654
and that’s exactly what he did.


1:09:01.653 --> 1:09:06.125
As we know, 
there were other conscience matters. 


1:09:06.125 --> 1:09:08.827
David committed adultery with Bath-sheba 


1:09:08.827 --> 1:09:11.730
and had her husband, Uriah, killed. 


1:09:11.730 --> 1:09:16.202
So he sinned against Jehovah, 
he sinned against Uriah, 


1:09:16.202 --> 1:09:20.205
and he sinned against his other wives. 


1:09:20.205 --> 1:09:23.108
Imagine poor Abigail. 


1:09:23.108 --> 1:09:25.476
She’d been rescued from one bad marriage, 


1:09:25.477 --> 1:09:29.182
and now her new husband 
had betrayed her. 


1:09:29.182 --> 1:09:33.785
When his sins came to light, 
how did David react? 


1:09:33.785 --> 1:09:36.422
Well, here’s what he could not do: 


1:09:36.422 --> 1:09:39.592
He could not resurrect Uriah. 


1:09:39.592 --> 1:09:44.597
But he could sincerely repent 
of his sins, and he did. 


1:09:44.597 --> 1:09:47.432
And, in turn, 
the prophet Nathan told him: 


1:09:47.432 --> 1:09:51.070
“Jehovah . . . forgives your sin.” 


1:09:51.070 --> 1:09:53.072
What else could David do? 


1:09:53.072 --> 1:09:55.074
He could have faith


1:09:55.073 --> 1:09:57.576
—faith that Jehovah really meant it 


1:09:57.577 --> 1:10:00.000
when He said that He forgave His servant.


1:10:01.513 --> 1:10:04.250
Well, what about us? 


1:10:04.250 --> 1:10:06.685
In some cases, we may not be able 


1:10:06.685 --> 1:10:09.255
to undo our mistakes in our current lifetime. 


1:10:09.255 --> 1:10:12.157
We may have to live with the consequences. 


1:10:12.157 --> 1:10:14.394
But here’s what we can do: 


1:10:14.393 --> 1:10:16.895
We can take Jehovah at his word, 


1:10:16.895 --> 1:10:21.000
trusting that he will support 
us through difficult times


1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:26.000
—even if the difficult times 
are of our own making. 


1:10:27.773 --> 1:10:30.741
David allowed Jehovah 


1:10:30.742 --> 1:10:34.447
to help him recover spiritually. 


1:10:34.447 --> 1:10:36.549
I’m going to repeat that. 


1:10:36.548 --> 1:10:39.851
David allowed Jehovah 


1:10:39.852 --> 1:10:43.789
to help him recover spiritually. 


1:10:43.788 --> 1:10:45.790
How did he do that? 


1:10:45.790 --> 1:10:49.060
Well, one way 
was by humbly accepting the counsel 


1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:52.798
of an experienced elder, 
the prophet Nathan. 


1:10:52.798 --> 1:10:55.166
His repentance was sincere. 


1:10:55.167 --> 1:10:57.770
There was no— 
There was no facade about it. 


1:10:57.770 --> 1:10:59.772
We know that. 


1:10:59.772 --> 1:11:02.875
We know that David 
repented with a good attitude 


1:11:02.875 --> 1:11:05.177
because later David and Bath-sheba 


1:11:05.177 --> 1:11:09.682
even named one of their sons Nathan, 


1:11:09.682 --> 1:11:13.019
and you don’t do that if you resent someone. 


1:11:13.018 --> 1:11:16.555
He took the counsel with a good attitude. 


1:11:16.555 --> 1:11:19.858
David learned from his mistakes, 


1:11:19.858 --> 1:11:23.195
and he kept on doing what was good. 


1:11:23.195 --> 1:11:25.863
Now, he may have been thinking 
of himself when he wrote 


1:11:25.863 --> 1:11:30.000
what we read at Psalm 37:23, 24: 


1:11:34.072 --> 1:11:38.710
“Jehovah guides the steps of a man 
when He finds pleasure in his way. 


1:11:38.710 --> 1:11:43.148
“Although he may fall, 
he will not be hurled down, 


1:11:43.148 --> 1:11:47.218
for Jehovah supports him by the hand.” 


1:11:47.218 --> 1:11:52.023
And David felt that support 
on many occasions. 


1:11:52.023 --> 1:11:55.193
Well, how can we learn 
from David’s example? 


1:11:55.193 --> 1:12:00.065
If we sin, we have to let 
Jehovah help us recover. 


1:12:00.065 --> 1:12:05.603
And more often than not, 
he’ll use the elders for that purpose.


1:12:05.603 --> 1:12:10.641
What about you faithful parents 
whose child has gone astray? 


1:12:10.642 --> 1:12:14.380
David would understand your sorrow


1:12:14.380 --> 1:12:17.548
—the sleepless nights, the tears, 


1:12:17.548 --> 1:12:21.453
the heartache, the worry. 


1:12:21.453 --> 1:12:26.358
One of his own sons, Amnon, 
raped his daughter Tamar. 


1:12:26.358 --> 1:12:28.893
Another of his sons, Absalom, 


1:12:28.893 --> 1:12:32.663
killed Amnon and then fled
the country for three years.


1:12:32.663 --> 1:12:34.733
Finally, the Bible says: 


1:12:34.733 --> 1:12:37.401
“David longed to go to Absalom, 


1:12:37.402 --> 1:12:42.340
for he had become reconciled 
to the death of Amnon.” 


1:12:42.340 --> 1:12:44.342
So he called him back. 


1:12:44.342 --> 1:12:46.345
You might say, in effect, 


1:12:46.345 --> 1:12:51.350
that Absalom got 
a three-year time-out for murder. 


1:12:51.350 --> 1:12:54.152
Did he appreciate the mercy? 


1:12:54.152 --> 1:12:56.155
No, he did not. 


1:12:56.155 --> 1:12:59.290
He tried to take the throne from David, 


1:12:59.290 --> 1:13:02.160
conspired against his own father. 


1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:05.497
And you wonder, 
‘What was he thinking?’ 


1:13:05.497 --> 1:13:08.900
Because at the time 
he was plotting against David, 


1:13:08.900 --> 1:13:11.570
he must have known 
that Jehovah had declared 


1:13:11.570 --> 1:13:15.207
that it was Solomon who was going 
to succeed his father and not Absalom. 


1:13:15.207 --> 1:13:16.242
He must have known that. 


1:13:16.242 --> 1:13:21.980
Did he really think that he 
could frustrate Jehovah’s purpose? 


1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:25.050
Wicked Absalom was finally put to death, 


1:13:25.050 --> 1:13:28.553
and David was devastated. 


1:13:28.553 --> 1:13:32.190
The poor young man


1:13:32.190 --> 1:13:38.663
—seems he had a weak spot 
for his wicked sons.


1:13:38.663 --> 1:13:40.931
You know, 
when we think of permissive parents, 


1:13:40.932 --> 1:13:45.970
we often think of High Priest Eli 
and his sons, Hophni and Phinehas. 


1:13:45.970 --> 1:13:50.075
But when you think about it, 
David was a bit permissive himself. 


1:13:50.075 --> 1:13:54.780
And you wonder if Solomon 
wasn’t thinking of his own half brothers 


1:13:54.780 --> 1:13:57.000
when he encouraged parents to use the rod. 


1:14:00.918 --> 1:14:04.923
Now, David couldn’t force his wicked sons 


1:14:04.923 --> 1:14:08.193
to respect Jehovah’s standards, 


1:14:08.193 --> 1:14:10.328
but there was something he could do. 


1:14:10.328 --> 1:14:14.265
He had a faithful son at home, Solomon. 


1:14:14.265 --> 1:14:18.003
And so David and Bath-sheba 
could lavish Solomon 


1:14:18.003 --> 1:14:21.071
with the love and affection that he deserved 


1:14:21.072 --> 1:14:23.842
and also help him to grow spiritually. 


1:14:23.842 --> 1:14:27.947
And they obviously did, 
because at Proverbs 4:3 we read— 


1:14:27.947 --> 1:14:29.982
These are Solomon’s words: 


1:14:29.982 --> 1:14:33.219
“I was a true son to my father 


1:14:33.218 --> 1:14:37.021
and the one especially loved by my mother.” 


1:14:37.022 --> 1:14:38.890
And then he added: 


1:14:38.890 --> 1:14:40.992
“He taught me.” 


1:14:40.992 --> 1:14:45.000
So David obviously was teaching 
his son to grow spiritually. 


1:14:46.598 --> 1:14:49.768
Now, it doesn’t always happen that way. 


1:14:49.768 --> 1:14:53.571
Consider this true-to-life scenario: 


1:14:53.572 --> 1:14:56.942
A brother and sister have two sons. 


1:14:56.942 --> 1:15:01.214
One leaves the truth 
and the other remains faithful. 


1:15:01.213 --> 1:15:04.516
The parents are heartbroken, and like David, 


1:15:04.517 --> 1:15:08.854
they go into mourning for their son. 


1:15:08.853 --> 1:15:12.390
And that’s completely understandable, 


1:15:12.390 --> 1:15:14.458
but we have to ask: 


1:15:14.458 --> 1:15:18.330
What about the son at home 
who has remained faithful? 


1:15:18.330 --> 1:15:22.667
What about the son who has never given 
his parents a moment’s grief? 


1:15:22.667 --> 1:15:26.104
Will he continue to get 
the love and affection 


1:15:26.103 --> 1:15:28.206
that he so richly deserves, 


1:15:28.207 --> 1:15:32.000
or will it be all about his brother?


1:15:33.245 --> 1:15:36.113
Many of our modern-day fellow believers 


1:15:36.113 --> 1:15:39.283
have demonstrated their trust in Jehovah. 


1:15:39.283 --> 1:15:43.021
One brother who remained faithful 
till his death in 2015, 


1:15:43.022 --> 1:15:45.057
said this: 


1:15:45.057 --> 1:15:47.825
“Life is unpredictable at times, 


1:15:47.825 --> 1:15:51.430
“uncertain, and even hard to deal with. 


1:15:51.430 --> 1:15:55.300
But Jehovah blesses those who lean on him.” 


1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:57.302
And his advice: 


1:15:57.302 --> 1:15:59.705
“Pray to be as productive 


1:15:59.705 --> 1:16:02.207
“and as active in Jehovah’s service 


1:16:02.207 --> 1:16:04.442
as you can be.” 


1:16:04.442 --> 1:16:06.312
And notice this: 


1:16:06.312 --> 1:16:08.714
“Focus on what you can do, 


1:16:08.713 --> 1:16:12.516
not on what you cannot do.” 


1:16:12.517 --> 1:16:16.789
That excellent advice 
is being followed by traveling overseers 


1:16:16.788 --> 1:16:20.425
who are transitioning 
into other forms of service. 


1:16:20.425 --> 1:16:24.697
It’s also being applied 
by longtime members of the Bethel family 


1:16:24.697 --> 1:16:28.600
who are no longer serving 
as department overseers. 


1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:32.770
They are grateful to Jehovah 
for what they can do, 


1:16:32.770 --> 1:16:35.540
and they focus on that.


1:16:35.540 --> 1:16:40.445
As this system of things 
degenerates from bad to worse, 


1:16:40.445 --> 1:16:43.782
we can expect difficult times. 


1:16:43.782 --> 1:16:47.552
When that coalition of nations, 
known as Gog of Magog, 


1:16:47.552 --> 1:16:50.322
launches its final attack on God’s people, 


1:16:50.322 --> 1:16:53.625
it will seem that there is no way out. 


1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:58.630
Our most formidable weapon 
at that time will be our faith. 


1:16:58.630 --> 1:17:01.833
And so, brothers, it’s fitting 


1:17:01.833 --> 1:17:07.000
that our yeartext for 2017 should be 


1:17:08.873 --> 1:17:12.876
Psalm 37:3: 


1:17:12.877 --> 1:17:18.000
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.”


1:17:35.167 --> 1:17:37.169
Thank you very much, Brother Splane. 


1:17:37.168 --> 1:17:41.000
We’ll remember that talk 
at least until the end of next year. 


1:17:43.875 --> 1:18:02.212
Your talk was well-spoken, as usual.

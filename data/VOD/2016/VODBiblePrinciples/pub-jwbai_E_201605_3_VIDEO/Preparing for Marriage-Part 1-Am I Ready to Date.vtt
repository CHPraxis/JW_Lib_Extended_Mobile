Having a spiritually strong family

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares us also for other changes in life.

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you are in your teens

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:14.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re starting to notice
those of the opposite sex.

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:18.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such emotions are natural
and are part of growing up.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’re not old enough to get married,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you need to keep in mind?

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:26.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This young sister made wise decisions

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the loving help of her parents.

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:43.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhh, yours?

00:00:43.193 --> 00:00:44.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
Thanks.

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:46.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re Lily, right?

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
And you’re Sean.

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
I’ve seen you around.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You play good basketball.

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.
So do you.

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you want to hang out sometime?

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Lily,
and I sorta had this problem.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a boy named Sean
that recently moved to our school.

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I’m not supposed to like anyone
who is not a Witness.

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The trouble was,

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he <i>is</i>  a Witness.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sean and his family
moved into our congregation.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the more I saw of him,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more I liked him.

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If only I knew where to find God!

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like I said, “I had a problem.”

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day I see couples my age at school.

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, they look happy.

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:20.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, I wanted that happiness too.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents noticed my problem too

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talked about it that night.

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:36.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And pretty soon

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel alone anymore.

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mom invited me
to go with her to run an errand.

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward, we went to a little café.

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She asked me how things were going.

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I didn’t want to tell her,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she made me feel really comfortable.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I told her my feelings for Sean,

00:02:57.694 --> 00:03:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expecting her to think bad of me.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:02.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she didn’t.

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything you’re feeling is natural, Lily.

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember having these same feelings
when I was your age too.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just how Jehovah created us, Honey.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:19.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because he created us, he knows

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way for us to be happy.

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s all he wants for us.

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:27.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s all Daddy and I want for you too.

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t scold me;
she didn’t make me feel embarrassed.

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:36.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most importantly,
she didn’t seem to be in a rush.

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:41.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom wasn’t the only one helping me.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:44.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad was preparing
to help me with my problem too.

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:47.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That evening, we had family worship.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once again,

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they just let me talk.

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told me I didn’t have to hold back,
so I didn’t.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:57.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just don’t know what to do.

00:03:57.387 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lily, thank you for telling us how you feel.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me ask you something:

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think Jehovah
created us with these

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
natural feelings toward the opposite sex?

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that one day a man and woman could marry.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right!

00:04:14.137 --> 00:04:16.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, a good marriage

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like two skaters on the ice.

00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A beautiful performance

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:23.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can seem effortless, but is it really?

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:24.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one would even attempt
that without practice,

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a capable partner,
or the right kind of guidance.

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right?

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the same with a good marriage,
Sweetie.

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t just happen.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:42.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It too depends on a good partner,

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:47.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coordinated effort, but most importantly,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wise counsel from Jehovah.

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:53.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
could you please turn with me

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:58.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Psalm 32:8
and read that for us.

00:04:58.448 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:02.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:06.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will give you insight and instruct you
in the way you should go.

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:09.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.”

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:12.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lily, Jehovah loves us very much.

00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we listen to him,
we’ll make good decisions in our life

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with absolutely no regrets.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We talked some more,
and then I got some homework.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad gave me some articles
he printed out for me to read,

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:30.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I did.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as I read the words

00:05:33.983 --> 00:05:36.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started meditating on them,

00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized something.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By holding off dating a little longer,
I wasn’t missing out.

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, I was preparing myself.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could use the time now to focus

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:55.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on something much more important

00:05:55.138 --> 00:05:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could also gain Christian qualities

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:03.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience that will help me later

00:06:03.146 --> 00:06:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I ever do get married.

00:13 My name is Shawn.
00:15 I was raised in the truth.
00:19 I was doing everything right.
00:32 But I was doing everything wrong.
01:01 I was in my senior year of high school.
01:03 Everything was going great
01:06 until this new girl joined our school.
01:16 I really don’t know  how it even started.
01:18 We just sort of hit it off  and became good friends.
01:24 I mean, she was so easy to talk to.
01:54 Before I knew it,
01:56 we were texting all the time.
01:58 Then, one thing led to another.
02:04 Honestly, when things  started to get physical,
02:07 I thought I could control it,
02:10 but it was only getting worse.
02:24 I didn’t want to let my parents down.
02:27 So I started lying to them,
02:33 and then I started lying to myself.
02:40 I thought if I could just keep  going to the meetings and do my parts,
02:44 it could somehow be OK.
02:50 But I was far from OK.
02:57 The next night, we had family worship.
03:01 We were reading about the account  of Ananias and his wife, Sapphira.
03:12 When a special fund was set up  for needy Christians, Ananias sold a field.
03:17 But then, he boldly claimed  he was contributing
03:21 the entire proceeds of its sale.
03:24 In reality, though,  Ananias had “secretly held back
03:28 some of the price”  for his personal gain.
03:32 Peter boldly said to him:  “You have lied,
03:36 not to men, but to God.”
03:42 Jehovah wasn’t fooled  by their pretense.
03:48 Then we read Psalm 44:21:
03:52 “[God] is aware
03:54 of the secrets of the heart.”
04:08 Reading this account of Ananias  and Sapphira made me realize
04:20 I wasn’t just lying  to my parents or my friends.
04:27 I was lying to Jehovah.
04:30 As much as I didn’t want  to let my parents down,
04:33 even more so,  I didn’t want to let Jehovah down.
04:45 I prayed long that night.
04:49 I didn’t hold anything back.
04:57 By the next morning,  I knew what I wanted to do.
05:34 It wasn’t easy,  but my parents were very supportive,
05:39 and I also got the help  I needed from the elders.
05:56 It’s been a few years,  but as I look back now,
06:00 I was one of those kids  living a double life.
06:05 But now with Jehovah’s help,
06:09 I’m living the best life.

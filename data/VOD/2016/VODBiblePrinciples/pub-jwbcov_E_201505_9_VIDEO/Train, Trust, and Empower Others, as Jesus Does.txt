00:09 It’s nine o’clock already?
00:12 It looks like it’s going to be  another late night.
00:16 I just can’t seem to catch up.
00:29 I’m trying to keep up  with everything,
00:32 but there just never seems  to be enough time in the day.
00:38 I’m not a superman
00:40 —nobody is.
00:43 Hmm.
00:47 Could anyone  have been busier than Jesus?
00:51 But you know what?
00:53 He wasn’t alone,
00:55 he had help,
00:57 he had his faithful disciples.
01:01 He took the time to patiently train them.
01:04 He showed his trust in them
01:06 by giving them assignments.
01:10 And he empowered them
01:12 by giving them the tools that they needed.
01:14 Hmm.
01:18 How about that!
01:21 I don’t have  to be a superman.
01:35 I just have to imitate  the greatest man.
01:39 Hey, Brandon,  it’s John.
01:41 I was wondering if you could  help me with something?

00:09.112 --> 00:12.157
It’s nine o’clock already? 


00:12.157 --> 00:16.829
It looks like it’s going to be 
another late night.


00:16.828 --> 00:20.000
I just can’t seem to catch up.


00:29.633 --> 00:32.510
I’m trying to keep up 
with everything, 


00:32.510 --> 00:37.000
but there just never seems 
to be enough time in the day.


00:38.183 --> 00:40.310
I’m not a superman


00:40.310 --> 00:43.605
—nobody is.


00:43.605 --> 00:45.000
Hmm.


00:47.108 --> 00:51.780
Could anyone 
have been busier than Jesus?


00:51.780 --> 00:53.782
But you know what? 


00:53.782 --> 00:55.784
He wasn’t alone, 


00:55.783 --> 00:57.786
he had help, 


00:57.787 --> 01:00.000
he had his faithful disciples.


01:01.123 --> 01:04.335
He took the time to patiently train them.


01:04.335 --> 01:06.753
He showed his trust in them 


01:06.753 --> 01:09.000
by giving them assignments.


01:10.298 --> 01:12.425
And he empowered them 


01:12.425 --> 01:14.928
by giving them the tools that they needed.


01:14.928 --> 01:17.000
Hmm.


01:18.390 --> 01:20.000
How about that! 


01:21.268 --> 01:24.000
I don’t have 
to be a superman.


01:35.115 --> 01:39.160
I just have to imitate 
the greatest man.


01:39.160 --> 01:41.163
Hey, Brandon, 
it’s John. 


01:41.163 --> 01:55.490
I was wondering if you could 
help me with something?

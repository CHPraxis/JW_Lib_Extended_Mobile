00:23 Before the meeting starts,  I need to get things ready.
00:30 I’m Ben.
00:32 And as a ministerial servant,
00:35 I can do a lot  to help the congregation.
00:43 And that night  I was given another assignment.
00:49 Brother Richards asked if I could help him  update the territory maps
00:52 and organize our schedules  for public witnessing.
00:57 I think the brothers know  I can modernize all of this.
01:03 Brother Richards said to talk  to Brother Bello, first.
01:06 He was the service overseer for years.
01:11 Great idea!
01:12 But I can already imagine  the possibilities.
01:19 By that weekend,  I had almost finished.
01:27 I couldn’t believe the outdated ways our records were kept.
01:33 This is going to be way better  for the congregation.
01:37 And who knows  what else could be improved?
01:46 I thought I had everything ready  to show Brother Richards.
01:50 He liked the new ideas,  but then he asked me,
01:55 “What did Brother Bello think?”
01:59 Oh, Brother Bello!  I forgot.
02:02 I should have asked him,
02:04 but at this point,  did it really matter?
02:10 Brother Richards suggested  we read about Elisha.
02:15 When the older Elijah’s work was ending,
02:17 Elisha stuck close to his teacher.
02:20 Urged to stay behind,  Elisha repeatedly said:
02:24 “As surely as Jehovah is living  and as you are living,
02:29 I will not leave you.”
02:36 Until the moment Elijah left,
02:38 Elisha wanted to learn from him.
02:52 Like a son asking his father,
02:55 he wanted a double portion  of Elijah’s spirit
02:58 to continue the work he started.
03:03 And Elisha’s first miracle
03:06 was the same as Elijah’s last:
03:11 dividing the Jordan  with Elijah’s official garment.
03:16 Everything Elisha did  revealed his respect
03:20 for the experienced man Elijah.
03:25 I wasn’t finished  with my new assignment after all.
03:31 There was a lot I needed to learn  from Brother Bello.
03:36 He really understood our preaching territory
03:39 and the people who live here.
03:43 He liked my ideas,
03:45 but everything he showed me  made them even better.
04:05 I can do a lot  to help the congregation.
04:11 And I pray that Jehovah  lets me do even more
04:14 with the gifts he gave me
04:17 and with the wisdom  of experienced men.

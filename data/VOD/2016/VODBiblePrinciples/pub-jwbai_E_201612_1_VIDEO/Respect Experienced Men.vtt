00:23.668 --> 00:27.000
Before the meeting starts, 
I need to get things ready.


00:30.758 --> 00:32.761
I’m Ben. 


00:32.762 --> 00:35.764
And as a ministerial servant, 


00:35.763 --> 00:38.000
I can do a lot 
to help the congregation.


00:43.980 --> 00:47.000
And that night 
I was given another assignment. 


00:49.193 --> 00:52.865
Brother Richards asked if I could help him 
update the territory maps 


00:52.865 --> 00:56.000
and organize our schedules 
for public witnessing.


00:57.493 --> 01:02.000
I think the brothers know 
I can modernize all of this.


01:03.042 --> 01:06.670
Brother Richards said to talk 
to Brother Bello, first. 


01:06.670 --> 01:09.000
He was the service overseer for years. 


01:11.633 --> 01:12.801
Great idea! 


01:12.802 --> 01:16.000
But I can already imagine 
the possibilities.


01:19.892 --> 01:23.000
By that weekend, 
I had almost finished. 


01:27.315 --> 01:31.000
I couldn’t believe the outdated ways
our records were kept. 


01:33.780 --> 01:36.000
This is going to be way better 
for the congregation. 


01:37.702 --> 01:40.000
And who knows 
what else could be improved?


01:46.502 --> 01:50.965
I thought I had everything ready 
to show Brother Richards.


01:50.965 --> 01:55.052
He liked the new ideas, 
but then he asked me, 


01:55.052 --> 01:58.000
“What did Brother Bello think?” 


01:59.307 --> 02:02.644
Oh, Brother Bello! 
I forgot. 


02:02.643 --> 02:04.686
I should have asked him, 


02:04.687 --> 02:08.000
but at this point, 
did it really matter?


02:10.317 --> 02:14.000
Brother Richards suggested 
we read about Elisha. 


02:15.197 --> 02:17.784
When the older Elijah’s work was ending, 


02:17.783 --> 02:20.785
Elisha stuck close to his teacher. 


02:20.785 --> 02:24.748
Urged to stay behind, 
Elisha repeatedly said: 


02:24.748 --> 02:29.378
“As surely as Jehovah is living 
and as you are living, 


02:29.378 --> 02:32.000
I will not leave you.”


02:36.010 --> 02:38.345
Until the moment Elijah left, 


02:38.345 --> 02:41.000
Elisha wanted to learn from him. 


02:52.317 --> 02:55.320
Like a son asking his father, 


02:55.320 --> 02:58.573
he wanted a double portion 
of Elijah’s spirit 


02:58.573 --> 03:01.000
to continue the work he started. 


03:03.578 --> 03:06.331
And Elisha’s first miracle 


03:06.332 --> 03:10.000
was the same as Elijah’s last: 


03:11.295 --> 03:16.800
dividing the Jordan 
with Elijah’s official garment.


03:16.800 --> 03:20.887
Everything Elisha did 
revealed his respect 


03:20.887 --> 03:24.000
for the experienced man Elijah.


03:25.642 --> 03:28.000
I wasn’t finished 
with my new assignment after all. 


03:31.315 --> 03:35.000
There was a lot I needed to learn 
from Brother Bello.


03:36.695 --> 03:39.155
He really understood
our preaching territory 


03:39.155 --> 03:42.000
and the people who live here. 


03:43.827 --> 03:45.829
He liked my ideas, 


03:45.828 --> 03:49.000
but everything he showed me 
made them even better.


04:05.890 --> 04:09.000
I can do a lot 
to help the congregation. 


04:11.605 --> 04:14.483
And I pray that Jehovah 
lets me do even more 


04:14.483 --> 04:17.986
with the gifts he gave me 


04:17.987 --> 04:48.580
and with the wisdom 
of experienced men.

00:00 An important aspect
00:03 of keeping  the family’s spiritual health intact
00:06 is by making full use  of the Family Worship arrangement.
00:11 In this dramatization,  pay attention
00:14 to how the family head  is aware of the needs of the family
00:18 and how he plans accordingly.
00:20 Hi, my name is Joe.
00:24 A few weeks ago,  we all sat together for supper.
00:28 I was so tired, and my wife,  Jenny, felt the same way.
00:32 She always does it all,  taking care of the children so well,
00:36 but it was not easy  for her in recent weeks.
00:39 Sarah felt that we are too restrictive  on how she dresses.
00:43 She just does not understand.
00:45 It was hard to convince her.
00:47 And to motivate her  to share in the field service
00:50 is becoming a challenge.
00:52 It was not always like this.
00:54 She used to enjoy  going out in field service.
00:57 And Tom,  he is such a good boy,
01:00 but all of a sudden,  he was raving about the games
01:03 his classmates  have on their phones.
01:06 It’s always  about having supernatural powers,
01:09 and it fascinated him,  even though he is small.
01:12 But when I asked him  to take out the garbage,
01:15 suddenly  his superpowers left him.
01:18 And Mike,
01:21 our smallest,
01:23 it was hard  to get him to go to bed
01:25 or clean up his room.
01:29 I realized there are a few things  we need to speak about.
01:34 Joe came to me, and we talked  a lot about our children that same evening.
01:39 We wondered,  ‘What would be the best for them?’
01:41 We prayed together.
01:44 Then we had an idea!
01:48 The following day  we asked our children
01:52 if we could consider Noah  as the theme for our next family worship.
01:55 All of us liked the idea.
01:58 Each one of us  should prepare something.
02:02 Mike, Tom, and I  wanted to build the ark.
02:13 And, of course,  we need the animals.
02:18 And Sarah  should collect pictures
02:21 for the story  from our publications.
02:25 I also had to take time  to think again about the story of Noah
02:29 and how it  can help our family.
02:32 Jenny and Sarah were responsible  for the wardrobe and food.
02:36 While preparing,  I got the chance
02:38 to speak with Sarah about her dress  in a more relaxed setting.
02:43 She understood that,  like Noah,
02:45 when it comes to Jehovah’s commands,  we need to do “just so.”
02:51 Then the evening arrived.
02:54 We talked about  how it was before the Flood
02:57 and what kind of world  Noah and his family lived in.
03:01 Noah’s family needed  real courage to preach.
03:04 They had to explain about the rain  and how the ark would be needed
03:09 to survive the Flood —something that had never happened before.
03:14 All the people  thought they were crazy!
03:18 And while we were talking  about this, it came out
03:21 that Sarah felt embarrassed when she met  a schoolmate in the field service recently.
03:26 I realized Noah must have felt  the same as me,
03:31 and yet,  he was so courageous.
03:33 Dad read Genesis 6:9:
03:36 “Noah walked with the true God.”
03:40 So he could have every confidence  in his Friend, Jehovah.
03:43 I want to be just like that!
03:46 For Tom,  I found a great picture.
03:50 Dad told us that the world  at this time was very bad.
03:53 People were fighting  and many were afraid,
03:56 and that is why  Jehovah brought the Flood.
03:59 It made me think  about the games from my schoolmates.
04:02 I like to play those games,  but I know that Jehovah does not like that.
04:06 So why do I?
04:08 And the best part  was when we got inside the ark!
04:14 Then I read Genesis 6:19:
04:17 “And bring into the ark
04:19 two of every sort  of living creature.”
04:23 Dad showed us  how the animals went into the ark.
04:26 Each one had its own place,
04:29 and they went inside  two at a time without any chaos.
04:33 I explained that we also need  to keep our rooms clean like the ark.
04:38 I saw that Mike got the point.
04:42 We wanted  to keep in mind Genesis 6:22:
04:46 “And Noah did according to all  that God had commanded him.
04:50 He did just so.”
04:54 And then the rain came,  but we survived!
04:57 That was great!
04:59 We all realized
05:02 Noah also must have been  tired sometimes,
05:05 but he never gave up.
05:07 This was a good lesson for us.
05:11 We must take care  of our family as Noah did,
05:14 also by having  a regular family worship
05:17 like this.
05:21 That example really showed
05:24 many of the great benefits  of family worship.
05:27 In addition to the obvious
05:29 —coming together to learn  more about our heavenly Father
05:33 —we saw how family worship  gave the daughter
05:36 an opportunity  to open up about matters
05:38 that had been bothering her.
05:40 And thanks to the good work  of the parents,
05:42 all of the children  learned something
05:45 they could apply  in their daily lives.

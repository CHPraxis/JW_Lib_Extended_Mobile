00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t identify myself

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:05.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was scared of what kids

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at school would say about me.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peer pressure is probably the worst challenge

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you don’t just get

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peer pressure from friends,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you also get it from your teachers.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of my friends

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who joined this new Christian group

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started spreading false rumors

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of them said we were led

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by some unknown leader at the top.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I wanted

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand up and say, “Well, that’s not true!”

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to become fearful.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was hanging out with the wrong crowd,

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and girls invited me to go play

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the park after school.

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something kind of told me

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I shouldn’t have gone with them,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still went.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out of nowhere, I see two young men come,

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:54.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they tried to steal our backpacks.

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They started arguing with the boys in our group,

00:00:58.245 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they started fighting too.

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The police came,

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I saw the police,

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:05.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I was going to get into a lot of trouble,

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I just ran away.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, the teacher at school was mocking

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all religions saying: “The Bible is outdated,”

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “How can you know that God exists?

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“People have rewritten it so many times.

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you know it’s the truth?”

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember thinking to myself,

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I should say something.’

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did this the night before, ‘I should say something.’

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then my friend next to me said,

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bianca is a Jehovah’s Witness.”

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher looked at me wide-eyed

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said, “Do you have anything to say?”

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just stood there.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to say, and then the bell rang,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was just relieved.

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:41.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt how I imagine

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter would have felt.

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My conscience kept bothering me,

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I knew that Jehovah

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t approve of my association.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I had to open my mouth

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kind of prove myself

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me just cramp up inside,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt very disappointed in myself.

00:01:58.097 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said a prayer to Jehovah,

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I asked him to give me courage

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand up and say

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:05.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember a brother who gave a talk once,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he cited from the words

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Mark 8:38, where it says

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we shouldn’t be ashamed of following Jesus

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he would be ashamed of us.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words really touched my heart,

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I knew that I had to make changes soon.

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I had considered the example of Jesus,

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:31.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for courage and also for another opportunity

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend his name.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:37.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talking to Mum was probably the biggest help.

00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:38.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her experience

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her knowledge kind of helped

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give me the courage to keep going.

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:46.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Identifying myself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has served as a protection.

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In biology class,

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:52.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were talking about the topic of blood,

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my teacher made the comment

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those JW people will let their kids die.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said a really quick prayer to Jehovah

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:03.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I knew that was not the truth.

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I stood up, and I said,

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re called Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we don’t allow our kids to die.”

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy after that moment.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to give a witness

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my schoolmates started asking me

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what we really believe and practice.

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to give them

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:23.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a much more accurate understanding

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:25.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how our organization functions.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that I’m able to stand firm in my beliefs,

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel much better.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re doing it for Jehovah,

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re doing it for yourself.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not doing it to make them happy;

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:36.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re doing it to make Jehovah happy.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I feel scared or afraid,

00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:39.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say a quick prayer to Jehovah,

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he gives me the courage

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend my faith and keep going.

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:44.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have gained the respect

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and admiration of my schoolmates.

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:49.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not ashamed anymore of identifying myself

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m proud to represent Jehovah.

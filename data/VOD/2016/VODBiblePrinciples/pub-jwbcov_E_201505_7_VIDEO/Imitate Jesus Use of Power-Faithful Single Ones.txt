00:01 Being single can help you  focus more on other people
00:03 rather than concentrating  on yourself.
00:05 Being single,  having more time, more flexibility
00:08 really helped me  to attain this goal
00:12 which was regular pioneering.
00:16 I view singleness as a gift
00:18 because it opens up opportunities
00:21 to serve in a more focused
00:24 and more flexible way.
00:26 You can study more
00:29 and have more time  in the field ministry.
00:31 You have more time  for the friends.
00:32 You’re more available.
00:34 Singleness definitely is a gift
00:37 if it’s used  in the right way for Jehovah.
00:40 Singleness has  not always been easy.
00:44 Sometimes there  comes a period in life,
00:47 a certain age,  where people start to ask,
00:50 “Anja, did you find somebody?
00:52 Are you not yet married?”
00:55 And that’s not always easy.
00:56 Sometimes people look at you,  even brothers and sisters,
01:01 and feel a bit of pity for you maybe  because you’re still single.
01:04 That sort of draws your attention away  from what you are doing.
01:08 That sometimes can be difficult.
01:11 I think I guard  my singleness in the sense
01:14 that I look out  for what kind of movies I watch
01:16 —not too romantic because it’s easy
01:18 to fall into this type of thinking.
01:21 So I’ve also always  made sure that I associate
01:24 with a range of brothers and sisters  from different age groups
01:29 but ones that have  similar sorts of goals
01:31 and they have  a very positive outlook.
01:34 Following Jesus closely  as a single person,
01:37 I think,  is easier than as a couple
01:40 because if we reflect on Jesus’ life
01:43 —early to rise, late to bed,
01:46 fully focused on the ministry,  on his Father
01:49 —that, I think,  is easier for a single person.
01:52 He was available to help others,  he was available to teach others,
01:56 even for children he was available  for them to give comfort.
02:00 Jesus was so busy  in his ministry and was focused.
02:03 And when you’re single,  you’re able to do that.
02:06 You’re able to concentrate more  of your energy
02:08 and effort into the ministry,
02:10 into serving Jehovah more fully.
02:13 It’s not a matter  of just being single;
02:16 it’s a matter of how you use it
02:18 to support Jehovah’s arrangement.
02:20 It doesn’t matter  whatever age we are,
02:22 if we are single,
02:24 use the circumstances  that you’ve got at the moment
02:27 to do whatever you can
02:29 because we’re just living  in a momentous time.
02:31 There is so much work for us to do.
02:33 Just go and pioneer
02:36 or do something for Jehovah,
02:38 and wait for him  to surprise you.
02:41 You can use this time
02:43 to do all sorts of different things  in Jehovah’s service at the moment,
02:46 there are so many opportunities  opened up for single ones,
02:50 including single sisters, now
02:52 —going where the need is greater,
02:54 moving to different countries,  serving in Bethel.
02:57 So while you’ve got  these circumstances,
02:59 use the time now  because it’s wonderful.

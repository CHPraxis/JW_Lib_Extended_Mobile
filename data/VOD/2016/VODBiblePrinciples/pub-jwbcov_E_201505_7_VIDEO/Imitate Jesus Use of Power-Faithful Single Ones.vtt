00:01.272 --> 00:03.899
Being single can help you 
focus more on other people 


00:03.898 --> 00:05.985
rather than concentrating 
on yourself.


00:05.985 --> 00:08.778
Being single, 
having more time, more flexibility 


00:08.778 --> 00:12.950
really helped me 
to attain this goal 


00:12.950 --> 00:15.000
which was regular pioneering.


00:16.495 --> 00:18.872
I view singleness as a gift 


00:18.872 --> 00:21.750
because it opens up opportunities 


00:21.750 --> 00:24.587
to serve in a more focused 


00:24.587 --> 00:26.755
and more flexible way.


00:26.755 --> 00:29.383
You can study more 


00:29.383 --> 00:31.176
and have more time 
in the field ministry. 


00:31.177 --> 00:32.929
You have more time 
for the friends. 


00:32.928 --> 00:34.430
You’re more available.


00:34.430 --> 00:37.015
Singleness definitely is a gift 


00:37.015 --> 00:40.602
if it’s used 
in the right way for Jehovah.


00:40.602 --> 00:44.524
Singleness has 
not always been easy.


00:44.523 --> 00:47.651
Sometimes there 
comes a period in life, 


00:47.652 --> 00:50.362
a certain age, 
where people start to ask, 


00:50.362 --> 00:52.699
“Anja, did you find somebody? 


00:52.698 --> 00:55.075
Are you not yet married?” 


00:55.075 --> 00:56.910
And that’s not always easy.


00:56.910 --> 01:01.123
Sometimes people look at you, 
even brothers and sisters, 


01:01.123 --> 01:04.501
and feel a bit of pity for you maybe 
because you’re still single. 


01:04.502 --> 01:08.505
That sort of draws your attention away 
from what you are doing. 


01:08.505 --> 01:11.508
That sometimes can be difficult.


01:11.508 --> 01:14.010
I think I guard 
my singleness in the sense 


01:14.010 --> 01:16.138
that I look out 
for what kind of movies I watch


01:16.138 --> 01:18.140
—not too romantic because it’s easy 


01:18.140 --> 01:21.643
to fall into this type of thinking.


01:21.643 --> 01:24.605
So I’ve also always 
made sure that I associate 


01:24.605 --> 01:29.108
with a range of brothers and sisters 
from different age groups 


01:29.108 --> 01:31.486
but ones that have 
similar sorts of goals 


01:31.487 --> 01:34.365
and they have 
a very positive outlook.


01:34.365 --> 01:37.575
Following Jesus closely 
as a single person, 


01:37.575 --> 01:40.620
I think, 
is easier than as a couple 


01:40.620 --> 01:43.707
because if we reflect on Jesus’ life


01:43.707 --> 01:46.294
—early to rise, late to bed, 


01:46.293 --> 01:49.505
fully focused on the ministry, 
on his Father


01:49.505 --> 01:52.758
—that, I think, 
is easier for a single person.


01:52.758 --> 01:56.345
He was available to help others, 
he was available to teach others, 


01:56.345 --> 02:00.265
even for children he was available 
for them to give comfort.


02:00.265 --> 02:03.935
Jesus was so busy 
in his ministry and was focused. 


02:03.935 --> 02:06.438
And when you’re single, 
you’re able to do that. 


02:06.438 --> 02:08.731
You’re able to concentrate more 
of your energy 


02:08.732 --> 02:10.734
and effort into the ministry, 


02:10.733 --> 02:13.695
into serving Jehovah more fully.


02:13.695 --> 02:16.073
It’s not a matter 
of just being single; 


02:16.073 --> 02:18.408
it’s a matter of how you use it 


02:18.408 --> 02:20.785
to support Jehovah’s arrangement.


02:20.785 --> 02:22.412
It doesn’t matter 
whatever age we are, 


02:22.412 --> 02:24.039
if we are single, 


02:24.038 --> 02:27.125
use the circumstances 
that you’ve got at the moment 


02:27.125 --> 02:29.127
to do whatever you can 


02:29.127 --> 02:31.130
because we’re just living 
in a momentous time. 


02:31.130 --> 02:33.132
There is so much work for us to do.


02:33.132 --> 02:36.760
Just go and pioneer 


02:36.760 --> 02:38.762
or do something for Jehovah, 


02:38.762 --> 02:41.265
and wait for him 
to surprise you.


02:41.265 --> 02:43.600
You can use this time 


02:43.600 --> 02:46.937
to do all sorts of different things 
in Jehovah’s service at the moment, 


02:46.937 --> 02:50.315
there are so many opportunities 
opened up for single ones, 


02:50.315 --> 02:52.525
including single sisters, now


02:52.525 --> 02:54.528
—going where the need is greater, 


02:54.528 --> 02:57.071
moving to different countries, 
serving in Bethel. 


02:57.072 --> 02:59.534
So while you’ve got 
these circumstances, 


02:59.533 --> 03:15.111
use the time now 
because it’s wonderful.

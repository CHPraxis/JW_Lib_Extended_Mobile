00:05 A visual aid often makes  a clearer
00:09 or more lasting impression  on the mind than does the spoken word.
00:17 Under the direction  of the Writing Committee,
00:19 the Art Department  has enjoyed
00:22 the privilege of designing  and illustrating Bible literature
00:25 for almost 40 years.
00:27 The department was established  sometime before 1976.
00:32 But a small team of artists
00:34 had been working  on illustrations and typography
00:38 from as far back  as the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
00:44 The work of publishing Bible literature  has seen many changes.
00:49 Now there are EPUBs, interactive PDFs,
00:53 Web design, and HTML content,
00:57 all of which require new skills
01:01 as well as close collaboration
01:03 with many other Bethel departments.
01:07 The Art Department  is structured into teams.
01:11 Each team is made up  of designers, photographers,
01:15 illustrators, prop and set makers,
01:18 costume and makeup artists,
01:21 as well as production workers.
01:25 The team lead and the scheduler  work directly
01:27 with the Writing Department contact  known as a compiler.
01:32 After receiving  an early version of the text,
01:34 the three brothers discuss
01:36 the purpose  and possible look of the design.
01:40 All on the team  are invited to collaborate
01:42 as concepts are developed.
01:45 Each member contributes  to the overall design of a project.
01:51 Before any production work is started,
01:53 concepts are sketched and developed.
01:59 These sketches become a blueprint
02:01 that helps the team  understand the concept,
02:05 plan the resources,
02:08 and ensure  that the project stays on track.
02:15 Who is the target audience?
02:18 How will this publication be used?
02:22 The design should be clear and simple.
02:28 And it needs to work in all languages.
02:32 This is no small task.
02:37 When the design is ready,
02:39 the compiler presents a mock-up  of the publication
02:42 to the Writing Committee.
02:44 The committee reviews the design  and makes any needed adjustments.
02:50 After the concept is approved,  production begins.
02:55 Around the world,  there are many photographers
02:59 who work part-time to assist  in providing images.
03:04 Photographs are also taken in our studio
03:07 and other locations.
03:10 These images help give our publications  an international look.
03:19 Accuracy is vital.
03:22 A researcher provides  historical references and inspiration.
03:28 Hair, makeup, and costumes
03:32 are designed to depict  the time period and region.
03:37 Props, set design, and lighting
03:40 provide the right look and setting.
03:44 When combined,
03:46 each element helps tell the story
03:48 and capture the imagination of the viewer.
03:52 Sets are also built in 3D programs.
03:55 They can be used as art source
03:59 or as final illustrations.
04:10 Whether painted digitally  or with traditional materials,
04:15 the artist renders the illustration
04:17 in a style suited for its final use.
04:24 When design meets illustration,
04:27 infographics are born.
04:34 After final approval  by the Writing Committee,
04:37 files are sent to the printeries
04:39 and to the website  or used to create other digital versions.
04:46 In order to reach the hearts of those  who read a Bible-based publication,
04:51 hands and hearts  have to be involved in its creation.
04:56 Those of us in the Art Department
04:59 consider it a privilege to give support  to the most urgent of all work
05:05 —preaching the good news.

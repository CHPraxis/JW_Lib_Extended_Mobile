00:10 Here at Wallkill,  we have two rotary presses.
00:13 Each prints  something called a signature,
00:15 which is virtually the same  as a 32-page brochure.
00:18 The press can print  up to 94,000 signatures per hour.
00:23 If these were stacked  on top of each other,
00:25 they would reach the height  of a 30-story building every hour!
00:31 The process begins  with a 3,000- to 4,000-pound roll of paper.
00:36 It’s loaded along the press,  rolled into place,
00:39 trimmed, and lined  with double-sided tape.
00:43 Before the previous roll is finished,  the new roll is loaded onto the splicer.
00:50 By means of double-sided tape,
00:52 this roll is attached  to the expiring roll.
00:58 Next, the paper advances  to the four print units,
01:01 which apply ink on both sides  of the paper at the same time.
01:05 The presses use a technique  called offset printing.
01:09 This process uses printing plates  designed to allow water
01:14 to repel ink from the nonimage areas
01:17 and attract ink to the image areas.
01:20 The plate then transfers the ink  to a rubber blanket,
01:24 which then transfers  the ink to the paper.
01:31 Four colors of ink  are used to create the images.
01:34 They are black,  cyan, magenta, and yellow.
01:39 The ink on the paper  is applied in tiny dots.
01:42 By using this technique,  a wide range of colors can be achieved.
01:50 Now the paper  goes through the dryer,
01:52 which maintains a temperature  of around 400 degrees Fahrenheit
01:55 (200°C).
01:57 Solvents from the ink  are evaporated inside the dryer.
02:02 Next, in order to set the ink  so that it will not smear,
02:05 the paper travels through a series  of rollers filled with chilled water.
02:09 Now that the ink is dry,
02:12 the paper is folded and cut.
02:16 Finally, the conveyer  brings the cut signatures
02:19 out of the press,  and they are checked for quality.
02:24 They are then processed  and distributed to the congregations.

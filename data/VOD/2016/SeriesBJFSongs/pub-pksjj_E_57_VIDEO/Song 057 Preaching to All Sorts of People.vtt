We really want to imitate our God,
To be impartial, as we know he is.

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:36.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To save all sorts of people is his will;
He welcomes all to come and to be his.

We keep preaching ev’rywhere:

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All sorts of people
can become God’s friend.”

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:16.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter where they may be found
Or what at first they might appear to be.

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What really counts
is what they are at heart—

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The inner self, the one Jehovah sees.

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Jehovah welcomes all who make the choice
To leave the world and all its ways behind.

00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:12.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

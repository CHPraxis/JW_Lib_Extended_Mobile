00:00:09 At the start of the day, with the sun yet to rise,
00:00:17 We are making our way with the sleep in our eyes,
00:00:22 and we pray.
00:00:26 We are there with a smile for the people we meet.
00:00:34 Some may stop for a while, some pass by on the street, but we stay.
00:00:43 It’s the life that we choose; For Jehovah we live.
00:00:52 And whatever he asks, we will do.
00:01:00 In the work we endure, Whether sunshine or rain.
00:01:09 It’s a way we can say ev’ry day: “I love you.”
00:01:26 At the end of the day, with the sun sinking low,
00:01:35 Feeling happy and tired, in our heart there’s a glow,
00:01:40 and we pray.
00:01:44 It’s a life that we love, always giving our best.
00:01:52 And Jehovah we thank, for by him we are blessed ev’ry day.
00:02:01 It’s the life that we choose; For Jehovah we live.
00:02:09 And whatever he asks, we will do.
00:02:18 In the work we endure, Whether sunshine or rain.
00:02:27 It’s a way we can say ev’ry day: “I love you.”

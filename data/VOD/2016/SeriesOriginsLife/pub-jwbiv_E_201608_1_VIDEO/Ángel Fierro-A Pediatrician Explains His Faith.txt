00:09 My name is Ángel Santaliestra Fierro.
00:13 I studied medicine and surgery
00:15 at the Central University  and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.
00:22 Childbirth is awe-inspiring.
00:26 For example, when a mother’s efforts  culminate in childbirth,
00:31 that intimate bond formed  between a mother and her baby
00:36 is something I will never get tired of seeing,
00:38 even though  I’ve witnessed it dozens of times.
00:43 I was born into a devout Catholic family.
00:49 From the moment  I started studying at the university,
00:53 everything I learned was  in favor of evolution.
01:01 These studies impacted me,
01:03 even though I didn’t have  a strong foundation in evolution.
01:07 But deep inside me,  I believed in evolution,
01:14 but I didn’t have much  of an alternative.
01:20 Perhaps my own selfishness  was also to blame
01:24 because I didn’t have to answer  to God for my conduct.
01:27 I could do things  that I had been told as a boy were forbidden,
01:33 and so the figure of God
01:36 slowly began  to crumble in my mind.
01:39 I read a book entitled
01:42 Life—How Did It Get Here?  By Evolution or by Creation?
01:46 Well, I read through the whole book  that very same day,
01:50 and I saw so much evidence
01:53 that I immediately wanted to show
01:55 the book to my colleagues at the hospital.
01:57 At the time, I was still finishing
01:59 my specialized training in pediatrics.
02:02 Some of them called me a heretic!
02:07 For me, that book marked the beginning  of my belief
02:11 in an alternative  to the theory of evolution.
02:16 We all started,  both you and I,
02:19 every single human being,  as a single cell.
02:23 But this single cell did not  just produce a human.
02:28 It also produced the placenta.
02:31 For a mother,  it’s foreign tissue,
02:33 and yet it allows her  to transfer all the life
02:36 and potential she has  to her unborn child.
02:39 This is truly amazing!
02:42 It must have required a lot
02:44 for somebody  to have designed something like this.
02:49 This encourages me  to believe that a Creator exists.
02:53 I can only conclude
02:55 that it is worth the effort  to spend time
02:57 getting to know  the person who designed it.

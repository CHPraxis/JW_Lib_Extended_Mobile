00:09.280 --> 00:13.408
My name is Ángel Santaliestra Fierro. 


00:13.408 --> 00:15.618
I studied medicine and surgery 


00:15.618 --> 00:20.000
at the Central University 
and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.


00:22.752 --> 00:26.755
Childbirth is awe-inspiring. 


00:26.755 --> 00:31.760
For example, when a mother’s efforts 
culminate in childbirth, 


00:31.760 --> 00:36.015
that intimate bond formed 
between a mother and her baby 


00:36.015 --> 00:38.933
is something
I will never get tired of seeing,


00:38.933 --> 00:41.000
even though 
I’ve witnessed it dozens of times.


00:43.897 --> 00:47.000
I was born into a devout Catholic family. 


00:49.903 --> 00:53.240
From the moment 
I started studying at the university, 


00:53.240 --> 00:56.000
everything I learned was 
in favor of evolution. 


01:01.457 --> 01:03.709
These studies impacted me, 


01:03.708 --> 01:07.671
even though I didn’t have 
a strong foundation in evolution. 


01:07.672 --> 01:12.000
But deep inside me, 
I believed in evolution, 


01:14.135 --> 01:18.000
but I didn’t have much 
of an alternative.


01:20.850 --> 01:24.187
Perhaps my own selfishness 
was also to blame 


01:24.187 --> 01:27.692
because I didn’t have to answer 
to God for my conduct. 


01:27.692 --> 01:32.000
I could do things 
that I had been told as a boy were forbidden, 


01:33.863 --> 01:36.158
and so the figure of God 


01:36.158 --> 01:39.370
slowly began 
to crumble in my mind.


01:39.370 --> 01:42.080
I read a book entitled 


01:42.080 --> 01:46.252
Life—How Did It Get Here? 
By Evolution or by Creation? 


01:46.252 --> 01:50.547
Well, I read through the whole book 
that very same day, 


01:50.547 --> 01:53.134
and I saw so much evidence 


01:53.133 --> 01:55.135
that I immediately wanted to show 


01:55.135 --> 01:57.428
the book to my colleagues at the hospital. 


01:57.428 --> 01:59.848
At the time, I was still finishing 


01:59.848 --> 02:02.433
my specialized training in pediatrics. 


02:02.433 --> 02:05.000
Some of them called me a heretic!


02:07.857 --> 02:11.860
For me, that book marked the beginning 
of my belief 


02:11.860 --> 02:15.000
in an alternative 
to the theory of evolution. 


02:16.407 --> 02:19.410
We all started, 
both you and I, 


02:19.410 --> 02:23.080
every single human being, 
as a single cell. 


02:23.080 --> 02:28.002
But this single cell did not 
just produce a human. 


02:28.002 --> 02:31.297
It also produced the placenta. 


02:31.297 --> 02:33.924
For a mother, 
it’s foreign tissue, 


02:33.923 --> 02:36.760
and yet it allows her 
to transfer all the life 


02:36.760 --> 02:39.722
and potential she has 
to her unborn child. 


02:39.722 --> 02:42.515
This is truly amazing! 


02:42.515 --> 02:44.518
It must have required a lot 


02:44.518 --> 02:47.000
for somebody 
to have designed something like this. 


02:49.188 --> 02:53.110
This encourages me 
to believe that a Creator exists. 


02:53.110 --> 02:55.195
I can only conclude 


02:55.195 --> 02:57.740
that it is worth the effort 
to spend time 


02:57.740 --> 03:13.485
getting to know 
the person who designed it.

00:09.905 --> 00:11.990
My name is Petr Muzny.


00:11.990 --> 00:15.827
I studied law 
in different universities in Europe


00:15.827 --> 00:18.247
—in France, England, Czech Republic—


00:18.247 --> 00:21.334
and eventually I had my PhD, 


00:21.333 --> 00:23.418
which I defended in 2004. 


00:23.418 --> 00:26.671
I had become a Doctor of Law.


00:26.672 --> 00:29.259
I was born 
in former Czechoslovakia, 


00:29.258 --> 00:31.385
under the Communist regime, 


00:31.385 --> 00:35.305
where religion or religious beliefs 
were not promoted.


00:35.305 --> 00:39.477
And also the thought of God 
being a Creator of the universe 


00:39.477 --> 00:42.564
was considered as nonsense. 


00:42.563 --> 00:44.565
Concerning evolution, 


00:44.565 --> 00:47.067
I was, I would say, 
merely following 


00:47.067 --> 00:49.237
the mainstream thinking.


00:49.237 --> 00:51.239
But I came to realize 


00:51.238 --> 00:53.365
that we should really question 


00:53.365 --> 00:55.367
things that are around us, 


00:55.367 --> 00:57.954
all the theories 
and explanations that are given.


00:57.953 --> 01:02.165
But we shouldn’t take as granted 
all that we hear, 


01:02.165 --> 01:04.167
and especially when somebody 


01:04.167 --> 01:06.379
says that this thing is obvious, 


01:06.378 --> 01:08.380
or evident, so just don’t question. 


01:08.380 --> 01:10.382
Obey, or listen to it.


01:10.382 --> 01:12.802
I’m now a specialist in law 


01:12.802 --> 01:15.137
and in logic
—human thinking—


01:15.137 --> 01:18.640
and there is one basic principle 


01:18.640 --> 01:21.227
which pervades the whole universe. 


01:21.227 --> 01:24.229
It’s the principle 
of cause and effect. 


01:24.228 --> 01:28.275
So every effect around us 
must have a cause.


01:28.275 --> 01:30.277
You walk in a forest, and there, 


01:30.277 --> 01:32.864
right in the middle of the forest, 
you see a bench.


01:32.863 --> 01:36.075
The bench is the effect. 
What is the cause? 


01:36.075 --> 01:38.868
Is this accidental or deliberate? 


01:38.868 --> 01:40.955
Somebody must have made it, 


01:40.955 --> 01:43.165
because the principle is: 
Something designed 


01:43.165 --> 01:46.000
must have a designer.


01:47.670 --> 01:50.005
For me, when I see such diversity 


01:50.005 --> 01:52.967
of flowers, of trees, of butterflies, 


01:52.967 --> 01:54.969
I come to the conclusion: 


01:54.968 --> 01:57.805
The One who put 
that law of diversity 


01:57.805 --> 01:59.973
was there to tell us, 


01:59.973 --> 02:03.060
‘Please, enjoy life.’


02:03.060 --> 02:06.147
Because life is beautiful, 


02:06.147 --> 02:09.525
somebody who created it must be 


02:09.525 --> 02:12.778
somebody having beautiful qualities.


02:12.778 --> 02:14.780
Thanks to the study of the Bible, 


02:14.780 --> 02:16.865
I could put a picture, 


02:16.865 --> 02:19.283
a face
—symbolically speaking—


02:19.283 --> 02:28.440
to the One who created life.

00:09 My name is Petr Muzny.
00:11 I studied law  in different universities in Europe
00:15 —in France, England, Czech Republic—
00:18 and eventually I had my PhD,
00:21 which I defended in 2004.
00:23 I had become a Doctor of Law.
00:26 I was born  in former Czechoslovakia,
00:29 under the Communist regime,
00:31 where religion or religious beliefs  were not promoted.
00:35 And also the thought of God  being a Creator of the universe
00:39 was considered as nonsense.
00:42 Concerning evolution,
00:44 I was, I would say,  merely following
00:47 the mainstream thinking.
00:49 But I came to realize
00:51 that we should really question
00:53 things that are around us,
00:55 all the theories  and explanations that are given.
00:57 But we shouldn’t take as granted  all that we hear,
01:02 and especially when somebody
01:04 says that this thing is obvious,
01:06 or evident, so just don’t question.
01:08 Obey, or listen to it.
01:10 I’m now a specialist in law
01:12 and in logic —human thinking—
01:15 and there is one basic principle
01:18 which pervades the whole universe.
01:21 It’s the principle  of cause and effect.
01:24 So every effect around us  must have a cause.
01:28 You walk in a forest, and there,
01:30 right in the middle of the forest,  you see a bench.
01:32 The bench is the effect.  What is the cause?
01:36 Is this accidental or deliberate?
01:38 Somebody must have made it,
01:40 because the principle is:  Something designed
01:43 must have a designer.
01:47 For me, when I see such diversity
01:50 of flowers, of trees, of butterflies,
01:52 I come to the conclusion:
01:54 The One who put  that law of diversity
01:57 was there to tell us,
01:59 ‘Please, enjoy life.’
02:03 Because life is beautiful,
02:06 somebody who created it must be
02:09 somebody having beautiful qualities.
02:12 Thanks to the study of the Bible,
02:14 I could put a picture,
02:16 a face —symbolically speaking—
02:19 to the One who created life.

00:07.778 --> 00:09.863
My name is Monica Richardson.


00:09.863 --> 00:11.906
I studied genetics and chemistry


00:11.907 --> 00:14.000
and then medicine
in Stockholm, Sweden.


00:15.410 --> 00:17.997
I believed in evolution 
because of my education.


00:17.997 --> 00:19.582
Everybody did.


00:19.582 --> 00:21.000
It was something I never doubted;


00:21.000 --> 00:23.835
it was taught as a scientific fact.


00:23.835 --> 00:27.590
And even those 
who perhaps believed


00:27.590 --> 00:30.592
that there was a God 
believed that this God


00:30.592 --> 00:34.000
would have used evolution
in the creation process.


00:35.097 --> 00:38.350
I want to talk 
about the miracle of birth.


00:38.350 --> 00:40.602
Now, during pregnancy,


00:40.602 --> 00:44.774
the baby is supplied oxygen 
via the placenta,


00:44.773 --> 00:48.000
but at birth 
it will have to use its lungs.


00:49.737 --> 00:52.405
In the womb the baby’s lungs 
are collapsed.


00:52.405 --> 00:55.825
After breath, 
they have to become inflated.


00:55.825 --> 01:00.000
Now, this is a very hard work 
for the baby to do.


01:01.040 --> 01:03.875
So during the latter part
of pregnancy,


01:03.875 --> 01:06.837
there is a very special chemical


01:06.837 --> 01:09.424
produced and secreted


01:09.423 --> 01:13.051
called a pulmonary surfactant.


01:13.052 --> 01:17.347
And that chemical 
is being deposited on the surface


01:17.347 --> 01:19.434
of the peripheral parts of the lungs


01:19.433 --> 01:22.101
where the gas exchange
is taking place


01:22.102 --> 01:25.355
to lower the surface tension.


01:25.355 --> 01:27.357
And that means 
that when the baby is born


01:27.357 --> 01:31.000
and starts to inflate its lungs,
he can do it.


01:33.863 --> 01:39.745
One wonders, 
‘Is this a result of a clever,


01:39.745 --> 01:42.790
‘intelligent conception and design,


01:42.790 --> 01:45.000
or could it 
have happened by chance?’


01:46.293 --> 01:48.336
Well, it was 
when the Witnesses called on me


01:48.337 --> 01:50.297
that I really got encouraged to,


01:50.297 --> 01:54.000
for the first time in my life, 
look into the Bible.


01:55.093 --> 02:01.433
Life around us 
is so cleverly designed


02:01.433 --> 02:15.218
I can’t believe there is a design 
without a designer.

00:05 My name  is Rocío Picado Herrero.
00:08 I studied chemistry  at the University of Salamanca, in Spain.
00:14 I specialize in organic chemistry.
00:17 This field focuses  on the study of the carbon atom
00:20 and all the compounds  that are derived from this atom.
00:26 I believed that life  came about through evolution.
00:29 I remember seeing a picture  in a natural science book
00:32 that depicted the embryos  of different vertebrates,
00:36 and in the early stages of development,  the similarities were outstanding.
00:40 But when I started studying  at the university,
00:44 I began studying  in detail the process
00:46 on which  the evolution theory is based.
00:49 To my surprise,  I discovered that these processes
00:52 were not proven facts.
00:54 As a chemist, I’m fascinated
00:57 by the distribution  of atoms within a molecule.
01:00 It is interesting to note that in most living creatures
01:03 ​—​whether human, animal, or plant life​—​
01:06 the basic proteins required for life are made up
01:09 of a carefully interwoven collection of amino acids.
01:13 And with the exception of glycine,
01:14 all these amino acids  have two forms called D and L.
01:19 These two forms are each  a mirror image of the other,
01:23 just as the right hand is a mirror image of the left.
01:26 But that cannot be superimposed.
01:29 And what is really striking  is that all the amino acids
01:32 that make up these proteins belong only to the L series.
01:37 So I asked myself,
01:39 ‘How is it possible for blind chance to make all the amino acids
01:43 that are essential for life belong solely to the L series?’
01:47 I reached the conclusion that there had to be a higher power,
01:51 a Creator.
01:53 Even though  I had a religious upbringing,
01:55 my ideas were not clear  as to who God was.
01:59 I merely viewed him  as a Supreme Being
02:02 before whom  we would be held accountable.
02:06 The Bible  is not a science textbook.
02:09 Its purpose is not to describe  the universe we live in
02:12 or the laws  that regulate our universe.
02:14 But when it does mention science,
02:17 and when it discusses scientific matters,  it does so with great accuracy.
02:21 And undoubtedly the greatest benefit  is that it allows me to enjoy
02:25 a personal relationship  with the Creator of the universe
02:28 —a universe that fascinates me  from a scientific perspective.

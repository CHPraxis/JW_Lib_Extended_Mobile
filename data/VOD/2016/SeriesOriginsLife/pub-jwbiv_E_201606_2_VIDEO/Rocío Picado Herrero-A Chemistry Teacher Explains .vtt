00:05.902 --> 00:08.779
My name 
is Rocío Picado Herrero. 


00:08.778 --> 00:13.000
I studied chemistry 
at the University of Salamanca, in Spain. 


00:14.033 --> 00:17.328
I specialize in organic chemistry. 


00:17.328 --> 00:20.916
This field focuses 
on the study of the carbon atom 


00:20.917 --> 00:24.000
and all the compounds 
that are derived from this atom.


00:26.130 --> 00:29.592
I believed that life 
came about through evolution. 


00:29.592 --> 00:32.679
I remember seeing a picture 
in a natural science book 


00:32.678 --> 00:36.015
that depicted the embryos 
of different vertebrates, 


00:36.015 --> 00:40.852
and in the early stages of development, 
the similarities were outstanding. 


00:40.852 --> 00:44.022
But when I started studying 
at the university, 


00:44.022 --> 00:46.400
I began studying 
in detail the process 


00:46.400 --> 00:49.237
on which 
the evolution theory is based. 


00:49.237 --> 00:52.615
To my surprise, 
I discovered that these processes 


00:52.615 --> 00:54.950
were not proven facts. 


00:54.950 --> 00:57.035
As a chemist, I’m fascinated 


00:57.035 --> 01:00.163
by the distribution 
of atoms within a molecule.


01:00.163 --> 01:03.791
It is interesting to note
that in most living creatures


01:03.792 --> 01:06.545
​—​whether human, animal, or plant life​—​


01:06.545 --> 01:09.548
the basic proteins
required for life are made up


01:09.548 --> 01:13.098
of a carefully interwoven
collection of amino acids.


01:13.098 --> 01:14.515
And with the exception of glycine,


01:14.515 --> 01:19.632
all these amino acids 
have two forms called D and L.


01:19.632 --> 01:23.215
These two forms are each 
a mirror image of the other,


01:23.215 --> 01:26.548
just as the right hand
is a mirror image of the left.


01:26.548 --> 01:29.548
But that cannot be
superimposed.


01:29.548 --> 01:32.696
And what is really striking 
is that all the amino acids


01:32.697 --> 01:37.097
that make up these proteins
belong only to the L series.


01:37.097 --> 01:39.065
So I asked myself,


01:39.065 --> 01:43.932
‘How is it possible for blind chance
to make all the amino acids


01:43.932 --> 01:47.549
that are essential for life
belong solely to the L series?’


01:47.548 --> 01:51.631
I reached the conclusion that there
had to be a higher power, 


01:51.632 --> 01:53.299
a Creator.


01:53.298 --> 01:55.740
Even though 
I had a religious upbringing, 


01:55.740 --> 01:59.660
my ideas were not clear 
as to who God was. 


01:59.660 --> 02:02.747
I merely viewed him 
as a Supreme Being 


02:02.747 --> 02:05.000
before whom 
we would be held accountable.


02:06.515 --> 02:09.170
The Bible 
is not a science textbook. 


02:09.170 --> 02:12.340
Its purpose is not to describe 
the universe we live in 


02:12.340 --> 02:14.842
or the laws 
that regulate our universe. 


02:14.842 --> 02:17.595
But when it does mention science, 


02:17.595 --> 02:21.557
and when it discusses scientific matters, 
it does so with great accuracy. 


02:21.557 --> 02:25.395
And undoubtedly the greatest benefit 
is that it allows me to enjoy 


02:25.395 --> 02:28.690
a personal relationship 
with the Creator of the universe


02:28.690 --> 02:44.373
—a universe that fascinates me 
from a scientific perspective.

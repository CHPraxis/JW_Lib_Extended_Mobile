00:08.007 --> 00:11.887
My name is Irène Hof Laurenceau.


00:11.887 --> 00:15.432
I studied medicine
at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.


00:15.432 --> 00:19.000
And afterward, I specialized
in orthopedic surgery.


00:20.437 --> 00:23.774
I didn’t believe in a Creator
because I believed that the species


00:23.773 --> 00:26.000
came into existence
through evolution.


00:27.068 --> 00:30.530
By comparing the anatomies
of various organisms,


00:30.530 --> 00:33.742
we recognize similarities.


00:33.742 --> 00:35.994
To me, it was logical
that there was a link


00:35.993 --> 00:37.828
between these similarities;


00:37.828 --> 00:41.623
that it indicated that we descend
from a common ancestor.


00:41.623 --> 00:43.668
After my studies in medicine, 


00:43.668 --> 00:47.505
I worked in hospitals
in surgical departments.


00:47.505 --> 00:50.092
In orthopedics
—a large part of orthopedics


00:50.092 --> 00:52.219
involves the insertion
of prosthetics


00:52.218 --> 00:56.596
to replace joints that are sick
or no longer work.


00:56.597 --> 00:59.184
Because the knee
not only bends and straightens,


00:59.183 --> 01:01.936
there is also a sliding movement,


01:01.937 --> 01:04.000
a small rotation.


01:05.293 --> 01:07.941
With a prosthetic knee,
we cannot achieve


01:07.942 --> 01:11.000
the complete mobility
of a normal healthy knee.


01:12.988 --> 01:15.658
If we see someone
skating or dancing,


01:15.658 --> 01:18.076
we have to believe
that there is a designer


01:18.077 --> 01:19.912
who is superior to us.


01:19.912 --> 01:21.915
For a foot to function properly, 


01:21.915 --> 01:24.333
there has to be harmony
between the joints,


01:24.333 --> 01:28.420
the tendons, the muscles,
and the nervous system.


01:28.420 --> 01:30.798
It’s difficult to imagine


01:30.798 --> 01:33.000
that it could be the result
of evolution.


01:34.385 --> 01:37.138
When someone came to my home
to speak about the Bible, 


01:37.138 --> 01:40.725
I found the arguments
in favor of creation more logical.


01:40.725 --> 01:43.143
Also, I learned there are


01:43.143 --> 01:45.438
renowned scientists
who have doubts


01:45.438 --> 01:48.816
themselves about the theory
of evolution.


01:48.817 --> 01:50.860
By studying the Bible,


01:50.860 --> 01:52.862
I came to better know
who God is.


01:52.862 --> 01:54.864
It’s like food.


01:54.863 --> 01:57.345
You have to taste it 
to know if it’s good.


01:57.345 --> 02:00.578
Likewise,
you have to study the Bible


02:00.578 --> 02:10.505
to realize 
that what it says is true.

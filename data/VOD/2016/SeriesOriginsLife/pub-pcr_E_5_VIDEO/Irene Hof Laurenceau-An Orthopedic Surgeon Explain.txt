00:08 My name is Irène Hof Laurenceau.
00:11 I studied medicine at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.
00:15 And afterward, I specialized in orthopedic surgery.
00:20 I didn’t believe in a Creator because I believed that the species
00:23 came into existence through evolution.
00:27 By comparing the anatomies of various organisms,
00:30 we recognize similarities.
00:33 To me, it was logical that there was a link
00:35 between these similarities;
00:37 that it indicated that we descend from a common ancestor.
00:41 After my studies in medicine,
00:43 I worked in hospitals in surgical departments.
00:47 In orthopedics —a large part of orthopedics
00:50 involves the insertion of prosthetics
00:52 to replace joints that are sick or no longer work.
00:56 Because the knee not only bends and straightens,
00:59 there is also a sliding movement,
01:01 a small rotation.
01:05 With a prosthetic knee, we cannot achieve
01:07 the complete mobility of a normal healthy knee.
01:12 If we see someone skating or dancing,
01:15 we have to believe that there is a designer
01:18 who is superior to us.
01:19 For a foot to function properly,
01:21 there has to be harmony between the joints,
01:24 the tendons, the muscles, and the nervous system.
01:28 It’s difficult to imagine
01:30 that it could be the result of evolution.
01:34 When someone came to my home to speak about the Bible,
01:37 I found the arguments in favor of creation more logical.
01:40 Also, I learned there are
01:43 renowned scientists who have doubts
01:45 themselves about the theory of evolution.
01:48 By studying the Bible,
01:50 I came to better know who God is.
01:52 It’s like food.
01:54 You have to taste it  to know if it’s good.
01:57 Likewise, you have to study the Bible
02:00 to realize  that what it says is true.

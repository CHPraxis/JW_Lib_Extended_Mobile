00:07.853 --> 00:10.353
The city of Milan, in northern Italy, 


00:10.353 --> 00:13.395
recently hosted 
an important international event


00:13.395 --> 00:16.728
—Expo Milano 2015. 


00:16.728 --> 00:19.353
It was an exposition 
that lasted for six months 


00:19.353 --> 00:22.770
with 145 participant nations 


00:22.770 --> 00:26.000
and 20 million visitors 
arriving from every corner of the earth. 


00:27.478 --> 00:29.436
What did Jehovah’s Witnesses do 
in order to spread


00:29.437 --> 00:33.000
the good news 
to such a vast number of people?


00:35.853 --> 00:39.478
Mobile witnessing carts 
were set up at strategic points 


00:39.478 --> 00:42.020
around the main entrance of the Expo. 


00:42.020 --> 00:44.853
Four hundred and fifty Witness volunteers  


00:44.853 --> 00:47.103
were instructed on how to spread 


00:47.103 --> 00:49.936
the message to the thousands of passersby.


00:49.937 --> 00:52.145
The theme of this Expo 


00:52.145 --> 00:55.062
was “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.” 


00:55.062 --> 00:57.687
And, in line with this, 
arrangements were made 


00:57.687 --> 01:00.312
to reprint the series of articles 
that appeared 


01:00.312 --> 01:04.395
in a 2012 issue of Awake! magazine. 


01:04.395 --> 01:08.645
The series was entitled 
“Is Your Food Really Safe?”


01:08.645 --> 01:13.103
Of course, most of the visitors 
would find accommodations in the city. 


01:13.103 --> 01:16.020
Therefore, congregations 
in and around Milan 


01:16.020 --> 01:20.145
made an effort to contact all the hotels 
in the area to offer the staff 


01:20.145 --> 01:22.228
and their guests 
an opportunity to read 


01:22.228 --> 01:25.520
this special edition of Awake! 
on food and nutrition.


01:25.520 --> 01:30.103
At first, some brothers were nervous 
they wouldn’t be received well, 


01:30.103 --> 01:32.686
but the reaction 
of most of the hotel administrators 


01:32.687 --> 01:34.395
was very encouraging.


01:34.395 --> 01:38.000
Almost everyone was happy 
to accept a copy of the magazine.


01:39.228 --> 01:41.270
Thanks to your cooperation, 


01:41.270 --> 01:44.395
each month the magazines were brought to us. 


01:44.395 --> 01:47.270
It has sparked interest because people


01:47.270 --> 01:49.478
—clients, the guests—
can find an interesting magazine 


01:49.478 --> 01:51.936
to look at in their own language, 


01:51.937 --> 01:56.000
and they nearly always run out of 
the magazines by the end of the week.


01:59.437 --> 02:01.437
Was it worth the effort? 


02:01.437 --> 02:04.062
Well, in a period of just six months, 


02:04.062 --> 02:08.520
over 360,000 magazines 
were placed


02:08.520 --> 02:13.000
—244,000 of which were 
the special issue dedicated to food. 


02:19.728 --> 02:24.000
And to date, 892 people 
have asked to be recontacted.


02:27.562 --> 02:30.729
In the past few years, 
the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


02:30.728 --> 02:34.020
has become much more visible 
in the city of Milan. 


02:34.020 --> 02:36.812
It’s not unusual to see them 
with their carts, 


02:36.812 --> 02:39.187
even in the more central areas of the city. 


02:39.187 --> 02:43.979
And I must say, they’re always smiling, 
polite, and well-dressed. 


02:43.978 --> 02:46.811
They have adopted a new method. 


02:46.812 --> 02:49.395
Now it’s the passersby 
who decide whether to stop 


02:49.395 --> 02:53.562
and take one of the items on display 
or have a brief conversation. 


02:53.562 --> 02:56.687
The Milanese people 
really like this method. 


02:56.687 --> 02:59.604
The topics presented 
are always very timely. 


02:59.603 --> 03:02.061
The display about food 
really stands out. 


03:02.062 --> 03:06.187
It brings to mind the general theme 
of the Expo—feed the planet. 


03:06.187 --> 03:10.229
I must say, it’s a great initiative.


03:10.228 --> 03:13.686
I was able to speak 
to a couple visiting from China, 


03:13.687 --> 03:16.187
and I gave them a copy 
of the special issue of Awake! 


03:16.187 --> 03:18.562
After having explained to them 
that we are volunteers, 


03:18.562 --> 03:21.395
to my great surprise, 
they invited me to have lunch with them. 


03:21.395 --> 03:24.312
We had a really nice conversation 
for around three hours, 


03:24.312 --> 03:26.562
during which they asked me 
a lot of questions. 


03:26.562 --> 03:28.937
I left them the book 
What Does the Bible Really Teach?, 


03:28.937 --> 03:31.354
and it was lovely to see 
how they agreed that the Bible


03:31.353 --> 03:34.853
really can improve people’s lives.


03:34.853 --> 03:39.520
A tourist from Argentina already reads 
our magazines regularly in her country. 


03:39.520 --> 03:43.520
When she saw our carts, 
she immediately recognized our magazines, 


03:43.520 --> 03:47.437
and then she took a copy 
of the special June 2012 issue. 


03:47.437 --> 03:50.145
She exclaimed, 
“I like your magazines 


03:50.145 --> 03:53.687
because they make a person 
a good person!”


03:53.687 --> 03:56.520
A school teacher, 
accompanied by her students, 


03:56.520 --> 03:59.062
noticed our special issue 
of the Awake! magazine 


03:59.062 --> 04:01.312
and told her students 
to each take a copy 


04:01.312 --> 04:04.479
because later on they would consider it 
in a class discussion. 


04:04.478 --> 04:07.311
Other school teachers present 
did the same, 


04:07.312 --> 04:11.687
so that in just a few minutes, 
we distributed 70 magazines.


04:11.687 --> 04:14.062
A specially equipped bicycle 


04:14.062 --> 04:17.479
was used to ride back and forth 
between the storeroom and the carts. 


04:17.478 --> 04:20.603
As a result, the magazines were available 


04:20.603 --> 04:23.000
7 days a week, 12 hours a day.


04:39.853 --> 04:43.978
How encouraging it is to make the most 
of every opportunity 


04:43.978 --> 04:46.000
to praise Jehovah!


04:55.437 --> 05:11.917
There really is 
no better way to use our time.

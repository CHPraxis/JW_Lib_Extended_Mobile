00:07 The city of Milan, in northern Italy,
00:10 recently hosted  an important international event
00:13 —Expo Milano 2015.
00:16 It was an exposition  that lasted for six months
00:19 with 145 participant nations
00:22 and 20 million visitors  arriving from every corner of the earth.
00:27 What did Jehovah’s Witnesses do  in order to spread
00:29 the good news  to such a vast number of people?
00:35 Mobile witnessing carts  were set up at strategic points
00:39 around the main entrance of the Expo.
00:42 Four hundred and fifty Witness volunteers
00:44 were instructed on how to spread
00:47 the message to the thousands of passersby.
00:49 The theme of this Expo
00:52 was “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.”
00:55 And, in line with this,  arrangements were made
00:57 to reprint the series of articles  that appeared
01:00 in a 2012 issue of Awake! magazine.
01:04 The series was entitled  “Is Your Food Really Safe?”
01:08 Of course, most of the visitors  would find accommodations in the city.
01:13 Therefore, congregations  in and around Milan
01:16 made an effort to contact all the hotels  in the area to offer the staff
01:20 and their guests  an opportunity to read
01:22 this special edition of Awake!  on food and nutrition.
01:25 At first, some brothers were nervous  they wouldn’t be received well,
01:30 but the reaction  of most of the hotel administrators
01:32 was very encouraging.
01:34 Almost everyone was happy  to accept a copy of the magazine.
01:39 Thanks to your cooperation,
01:41 each month the magazines were brought to us.
01:44 It has sparked interest because people
01:47 —clients, the guests— can find an interesting magazine
01:49 to look at in their own language,
01:51 and they nearly always run out of  the magazines by the end of the week.
01:59 Was it worth the effort?
02:01 Well, in a period of just six months,
02:04 over 360,000 magazines  were placed
02:08 —244,000 of which were  the special issue dedicated to food.
02:19 And to date, 892 people  have asked to be recontacted.
02:27 In the past few years,  the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses
02:30 has become much more visible  in the city of Milan.
02:34 It’s not unusual to see them  with their carts,
02:36 even in the more central areas of the city.
02:39 And I must say, they’re always smiling,  polite, and well-dressed.
02:43 They have adopted a new method.
02:46 Now it’s the passersby  who decide whether to stop
02:49 and take one of the items on display  or have a brief conversation.
02:53 The Milanese people  really like this method.
02:56 The topics presented  are always very timely.
02:59 The display about food  really stands out.
03:02 It brings to mind the general theme  of the Expo—feed the planet.
03:06 I must say, it’s a great initiative.
03:10 I was able to speak  to a couple visiting from China,
03:13 and I gave them a copy  of the special issue of Awake!
03:16 After having explained to them  that we are volunteers,
03:18 to my great surprise,  they invited me to have lunch with them.
03:21 We had a really nice conversation  for around three hours,
03:24 during which they asked me  a lot of questions.
03:26 I left them the book  What Does the Bible Really Teach?,
03:28 and it was lovely to see  how they agreed that the Bible
03:31 really can improve people’s lives.
03:34 A tourist from Argentina already reads  our magazines regularly in her country.
03:39 When she saw our carts,  she immediately recognized our magazines,
03:43 and then she took a copy  of the special June 2012 issue.
03:47 She exclaimed,  “I like your magazines
03:50 because they make a person  a good person!”
03:53 A school teacher,  accompanied by her students,
03:56 noticed our special issue  of the Awake! magazine
03:59 and told her students  to each take a copy
04:01 because later on they would consider it  in a class discussion.
04:04 Other school teachers present  did the same,
04:07 so that in just a few minutes,  we distributed 70 magazines.
04:11 A specially equipped bicycle
04:14 was used to ride back and forth  between the storeroom and the carts.
04:17 As a result, the magazines were available
04:20 7 days a week, 12 hours a day.
04:39 How encouraging it is to make the most  of every opportunity
04:43 to praise Jehovah!
04:55 There really is  no better way to use our time.

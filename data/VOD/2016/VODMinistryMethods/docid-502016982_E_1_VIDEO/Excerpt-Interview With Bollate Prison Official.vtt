00:03.023 --> 00:05.233
The Kingdom Hall
of Jehovah’s Witnesses


00:05.233 --> 00:09.988
is now a reality in this prison,
the prison of Bollate. 


00:09.988 --> 00:12.448
It has been up and running 
for around a year and a half. 


00:12.448 --> 00:15.118
And a truly notable 
number of inmates attend, 


00:15.118 --> 00:17.788
who every Thursday
and every Sunday


00:17.788 --> 00:20.000
freely choose to take part
in the meetings.


00:21.282 --> 00:23.415
All Bible topics are discussed


00:23.415 --> 00:24.917
and also the relationship


00:24.917 --> 00:27.505
with the authorities,
relationships with,


00:27.505 --> 00:30.217
that is the relationship with
the outside world,


00:30.217 --> 00:32.065
respect for the rules.


00:32.065 --> 00:34.137
The knowledge 
that so many people


00:34.137 --> 00:36.215
attend the meetings
of the Kingdom Hall


00:36.215 --> 00:38.100
—that are held
in the Kingdom Hall—


00:38.100 --> 00:42.325
has convinced us that it was
an excellent choice, worthwhile. 


00:42.325 --> 00:44.147
A Kingdom Hall
in other detention centers,


00:44.147 --> 00:59.100
well, that would be a great idea.

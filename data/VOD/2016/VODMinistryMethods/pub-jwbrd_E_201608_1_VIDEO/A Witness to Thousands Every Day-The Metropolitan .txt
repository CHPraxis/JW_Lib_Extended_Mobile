00:00 We received a report  from San Francisco, California,
00:03 in the United States,
00:05 where publishers have been engaged  in special metropolitan witnessing
00:08 since 2013.
00:10 It’s helping our brothers  reach multiple language groups,
00:14 start Bible studies,  and make disciples.
00:32 When I’m rolling the carts down  to get ready for the work,
00:35 I can feel people’s eyes on me  and it makes me feel proud
00:39 that I’m representing Jehovah  even before I get to the location.
00:43 We have a chance  to use our Bibles very regularly.
00:47 We talk to honesthearted people  who are interested
00:49 in really learning  what the Bible teaches.
00:55 Jehovah is reaching people  in those hard-to-reach areas
00:59 where it could mean their life
01:01 to even talk about things  such as the Bible.
01:05 When you’re part  of the metropolitan work,
01:08 you get to welcome people  being drawn by Jehovah.
01:16 We see thousands of people  every day who walk by our carts.
01:23 While we’re placing literature  in up to 40 different languages each week,
01:27 what’s really exciting is to see  how many conversations we’re starting
01:30 and how many Bible studies  we’re initiating.
01:33 We’re visible to a lot of people  in the community,
01:37 especially those who were inactive  or maybe were raised around the truth.
01:44 Jehovah has arranged  to have his people
01:46 put right in the center  of everything,
01:49 and we’re able to meet people  from all over the world.
01:56 I’ve met people from Peru, South Africa,
01:58 Japan, Germany, England.
02:01 France, Italy,
02:03 Cameroon, Congo.
02:06 Beaucoup!
02:15 In Shona, a greeting  would be something like . . .
02:30 . . . , which means  “Would you like to study the Bible?”
02:39 . . . , which means “Would you like  to study the Bible?” in sign language.
02:43 So when I asked her if she had seen  the sign-language Bible,
02:46 she shook her head no,  and I showed her Acts 17:27.
02:51 And as soon as it was done,  she started signing, “I understood that!”
02:54 And then she said,  “Didn’t you say this was a free app?”
02:57 So, right then,  she started downloading it on her phone.
03:01 We had a gentleman come up  and wanted to . . .
03:04 First, he said, “debate,”  and then he said, “just discuss.”
03:07 But as he was talking with us,  he had to catch his train
03:10 but he missed three trains
03:12 because he wanted to continue  the conversation and speak with us.
03:15 It’s a really good experience  because we just get to talk to people
03:17 and let them see  a different side of us.
03:20 It’s not necessarily about whether we placed a book with him or not.
03:23 And in the end, he turned  to my husband and I
03:26 and said, “You know, you’re  really good ambassadors.”
03:29 We start Bible studies  here every day,
03:32 and these studies  are conducted globally.
03:36 I met Alfredo in 2014,  right before the Memorial.
03:41 He approached the cart.
03:43 He had a rough life.
03:45 He was doing a lot of bad things,
03:46 and so he felt  that he couldn’t overcome them.
03:50 So I told him that no matter  how big his problems are,
03:53 they’re not too big  for Jehovah,
03:55 and so I encouraged him  to start studying the Bible again.
04:01 “Come, now,
04:03 and let us set matters straight  between us,” says Jehovah.
04:07 “Though your sins are like scarlet,
04:10 they will be made as white as snow.”
04:15 When Jehovah forgives you,  he forgives you completely.
04:20 I got baptized,  and in the same month,
04:23 I started auxiliary pioneering.
04:26 It is such a privilege to be  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
04:30 with brothers  all around the world.
04:37 If anybody is hesitant  to take part
04:39 in the special metropolitan  witnessing work,
04:42 maybe you’re worried about finances, time,
04:45 or you’re just afraid  that it’s something different
04:47 and you won’t know  what to do,
04:49 please don’t let  any of those things stop you.
04:52 It’s from Jehovah.
04:54 Grab hold of it tight,  and don’t let go!
05:19 Each month,  the brothers and sisters
05:22 in San Francisco’s  metropolitan witnessing
05:24 distribute  over 5,000 publications
05:28 and start an average  of 185 Bible studies.
05:32 After some initial concern  from local authorities
05:35 over having literature carts  at the Golden Gate Bridge,
05:37 authorities have expressed appreciation  for our brothers being there
05:41 with the Bible’s message of hope.
05:44 It’s been requested  that we always have on hand
05:47 the April 2014 Awake!  with the cover title
05:51 “Why Go On? —Three Reasons to Keep Living.”
05:55 One afternoon an officer  approached a cart and said,
05:58 “Well, your magazine worked!”
06:00 The police had just helped  a young woman
06:03 who was thinking  of jumping from the bridge.
06:05 When they reached her,  she had the Awake! issue in her hand
06:10 and had decided not to jump.
06:13 Life in this system  can be difficult for everyone,
06:17 but our witnessing work  comforts people
06:20 and teaches them to know  and thank their Creator for life.

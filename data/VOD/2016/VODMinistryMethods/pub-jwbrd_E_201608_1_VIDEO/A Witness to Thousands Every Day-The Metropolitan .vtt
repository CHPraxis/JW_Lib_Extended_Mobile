00:00.550 --> 00:03.453
We received a report 
from San Francisco, California, 


00:03.453 --> 00:05.455
in the United States, 


00:05.455 --> 00:08.925
where publishers have been engaged 
in special metropolitan witnessing 


00:08.925 --> 00:10.993
since 2013. 


00:10.993 --> 00:14.230
It’s helping our brothers 
reach multiple language groups, 


00:14.230 --> 00:19.000
start Bible studies, 
and make disciples.


00:32.815 --> 00:35.785
When I’m rolling the carts down 
to get ready for the work, 


00:35.785 --> 00:39.522
I can feel people’s eyes on me 
and it makes me feel proud 


00:39.522 --> 00:42.000
that I’m representing Jehovah 
even before I get to the location.


00:43.427 --> 00:47.297
We have a chance 
to use our Bibles very regularly. 


00:47.297 --> 00:49.832
We talk to honesthearted people 
who are interested 


00:49.832 --> 00:52.000
in really learning 
what the Bible teaches.


00:55.772 --> 00:59.409
Jehovah is reaching people 
in those hard-to-reach areas 


00:59.408 --> 01:01.476
where it could mean their life 


01:01.477 --> 01:04.000
to even talk about things 
such as the Bible.


01:05.948 --> 01:08.451
When you’re part 
of the metropolitan work, 


01:08.452 --> 01:12.000
you get to welcome people 
being drawn by Jehovah.


01:16.392 --> 01:20.000
We see thousands of people 
every day who walk by our carts.


01:23.365 --> 01:27.937
While we’re placing literature 
in up to 40 different languages each week, 


01:27.937 --> 01:30.907
what’s really exciting is to see 
how many conversations we’re starting 


01:30.907 --> 01:33.275
and how many Bible studies 
we’re initiating.


01:33.275 --> 01:37.913
We’re visible to a lot of people 
in the community, 


01:37.913 --> 01:41.000
especially those who were inactive 
or maybe were raised around the truth.


01:44.453 --> 01:46.655
Jehovah has arranged 
to have his people 


01:46.655 --> 01:49.458
put right in the center 
of everything, 


01:49.458 --> 01:52.000
and we’re able to meet people 
from all over the world.


01:56.598 --> 01:58.968
I’ve met people from Peru, South Africa, 


01:58.968 --> 02:01.370
Japan, Germany, England.


02:01.370 --> 02:03.873
France, Italy, 


02:03.873 --> 02:06.375
Cameroon, Congo. 


02:06.375 --> 02:09.000
Beaucoup!


02:15.418 --> 02:18.000
In Shona, a greeting 
would be something like . . .


02:30.233 --> 02:33.000
. . . , which means 
“Would you like to study the Bible?”


02:39.442 --> 02:43.079
. . . , which means “Would you like 
to study the Bible?” in sign language.


02:43.078 --> 02:46.348
So when I asked her if she had seen 
the sign-language Bible, 


02:46.348 --> 02:51.153
she shook her head no, 
and I showed her Acts 17:27. 


02:51.153 --> 02:54.623
And as soon as it was done, 
she started signing, “I understood that!” 


02:54.623 --> 02:57.026
And then she said, 
“Didn’t you say this was a free app?” 


02:57.027 --> 03:01.497
So, right then, 
she started downloading it on her phone.


03:01.497 --> 03:04.234
We had a gentleman come up 
and wanted to . . . 


03:04.233 --> 03:07.003
First, he said, “debate,” 
and then he said, “just discuss.” 


03:07.003 --> 03:10.406
But as he was talking with us, 
he had to catch his train 


03:10.407 --> 03:12.442
but he missed three trains 


03:12.442 --> 03:15.279
because he wanted to continue 
the conversation and speak with us. 


03:15.278 --> 03:17.946
It’s a really good experience 
because we just get to talk to people 


03:17.947 --> 03:20.182
and let them see 
a different side of us. 


03:20.182 --> 03:23.920
It’s not necessarily about whether
we placed a book with him or not.


03:23.920 --> 03:26.655
And in the end, he turned 
to my husband and I 


03:26.655 --> 03:29.558
and said, “You know, you’re 
really good ambassadors.”


03:29.558 --> 03:32.595
We start Bible studies 
here every day, 


03:32.595 --> 03:36.967
and these studies 
are conducted globally.


03:36.967 --> 03:41.437
I met Alfredo in 2014, 
right before the Memorial. 


03:41.437 --> 03:43.439
He approached the cart. 


03:43.438 --> 03:45.441
He had a rough life. 


03:45.442 --> 03:46.875
He was doing a lot of bad things, 


03:46.875 --> 03:50.480
and so he felt 
that he couldn’t overcome them. 


03:50.480 --> 03:53.683
So I told him that no matter 
how big his problems are, 


03:53.683 --> 03:55.785
they’re not too big 
for Jehovah, 


03:55.785 --> 03:59.000
and so I encouraged him 
to start studying the Bible again.


04:01.490 --> 04:03.525
“Come, now, 


04:03.525 --> 04:07.963
and let us set matters straight 
between us,” says Jehovah. 


04:07.963 --> 04:10.766
“Though your sins are like scarlet, 


04:10.767 --> 04:14.000
they will be made as white as snow.” 


04:15.605 --> 04:19.000
When Jehovah forgives you, 
he forgives you completely. 


04:20.543 --> 04:23.545
I got baptized, 
and in the same month, 


04:23.545 --> 04:26.482
I started auxiliary pioneering. 


04:26.482 --> 04:30.854
It is such a privilege to be 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


04:30.853 --> 04:35.000
with brothers 
all around the world.


04:37.327 --> 04:39.595
If anybody is hesitant 
to take part 


04:39.595 --> 04:42.065
in the special metropolitan 
witnessing work, 


04:42.065 --> 04:45.468
maybe you’re worried
about finances, time,


04:45.468 --> 04:47.670
or you’re just afraid 
that it’s something different 


04:47.670 --> 04:49.305
and you won’t know 
what to do, 


04:49.305 --> 04:52.242
please don’t let 
any of those things stop you. 


04:52.242 --> 04:54.210
It’s from Jehovah. 


04:54.210 --> 04:58.000
Grab hold of it tight, 
and don’t let go!


05:19.535 --> 05:22.338
Each month, 
the brothers and sisters 


05:22.338 --> 05:24.940
in San Francisco’s 
metropolitan witnessing 


05:24.940 --> 05:28.177
distribute 
over 5,000 publications 


05:28.177 --> 05:32.215
and start an average 
of 185 Bible studies. 


05:32.215 --> 05:35.083
After some initial concern 
from local authorities 


05:35.083 --> 05:37.920
over having literature carts 
at the Golden Gate Bridge, 


05:37.920 --> 05:41.957
authorities have expressed appreciation 
for our brothers being there 


05:41.957 --> 05:44.360
with the Bible’s message of hope. 


05:44.360 --> 05:47.463
It’s been requested 
that we always have on hand 


05:47.463 --> 05:51.200
the April 2014 Awake! 
with the cover title 


05:51.200 --> 05:55.237
“Why Go On?
—Three Reasons to Keep Living.” 


05:55.237 --> 05:58.474
One afternoon an officer 
approached a cart and said, 


05:58.473 --> 06:00.610
“Well, your magazine worked!” 


06:00.610 --> 06:03.245
The police had just helped 
a young woman 


06:03.245 --> 06:05.648
who was thinking 
of jumping from the bridge. 


06:05.648 --> 06:10.018
When they reached her, 
she had the Awake! issue in her hand 


06:10.018 --> 06:13.723
and had decided not to jump. 


06:13.723 --> 06:17.460
Life in this system 
can be difficult for everyone, 


06:17.460 --> 06:20.362
but our witnessing work 
comforts people


06:20.362 --> 06:36.129
and teaches them to know 
and thank their Creator for life.

00:01.397 --> 00:04.650
Tim, thanks for reading 
all the Appendix 


00:04.650 --> 00:08.112
“1914—A Significant Year in Bible Prophecy.” 


00:08.112 --> 00:10.114
You understood it, right?


00:10.113 --> 00:13.741
Well, it’s not completely clear.


00:13.742 --> 00:16.704
OK, well, let’s go through it again. 


00:16.703 --> 00:20.748
If you remember, 
Luke 21:24, 


00:20.748 --> 00:24.043
said that Jersusalem 
would “be trampled on by the nations 


00:24.043 --> 00:27.505
until the appointed times 
of the nations are fulfilled.” 


00:27.505 --> 00:31.343
Now, we know that began in 607 B.C.E., 


00:31.343 --> 00:33.970
and at Daniel 4:16, 


00:33.970 --> 00:37.140
it said that seven times 
would have to pass over it, 


00:37.140 --> 00:40.477
and at Revelation 12: 6, 14,


00:40.477 --> 00:42.855
it indicates 
that three and a half times 


00:42.855 --> 00:46.317
equals 1,260 days; 


00:46.317 --> 00:50.362
so seven times 
would be 2,520 days, 


00:50.362 --> 00:52.405
but of course, 
we got the Bible principle 


00:52.405 --> 00:54.700
at Numbers 14:34, 


00:54.700 --> 00:57.703
“a day for a year,
a day for a year.”


00:57.703 --> 00:59.955
So that 2,520 days would be 


00:59.955 --> 01:02.540
2,520 years. 


01:02.540 --> 01:05.377
So counting 2,520 years  


01:05.377 --> 01:07.755
from 607 B.C.E. 


01:07.755 --> 01:10.548
brings us to 1914 


01:10.548 --> 01:13.218
when Jesus began to rule 
as king in the heavens. 


01:13.218 --> 01:15.000
You got it now.


01:17.138 --> 01:19.975
Um, it’s still not clear.


01:19.975 --> 01:22.018
That’s OK, 


01:22.018 --> 01:24.855
I didn’t understand it 
the first time I went through it. 


01:24.855 --> 01:26.857
Just read the Appendix 


01:26.857 --> 01:28.400
a few more times, 


01:28.400 --> 01:30.610
and it will make sense. 


01:30.610 --> 01:33.000
Come on, 
let’s finish our study of chapter 8.


01:35.157 --> 01:39.244
So based on what we’ve been learning 
in chapter 8, 


01:39.243 --> 01:43.373
can you think of a good reason 
why it’s so important 


01:43.373 --> 01:46.710
that we know 
when God’s Kingdom began to rule?


01:46.710 --> 01:51.632
Well, I think that if you knew 
when God’s Kingdom began to rule, 


01:51.632 --> 01:53.800
then you would know 


01:53.800 --> 01:56.387
that the blessings of the Kingdom 
are soon to follow.


01:56.387 --> 01:58.014
That’s an excellent answer. 


01:58.013 --> 02:01.100
Of course, the Appendix here 
contains the scriptural proof 


02:01.100 --> 02:04.937
of when God’s Kingdom 
began to rule in 1914. 


02:04.937 --> 02:06.522
Would you like to read 


02:06.522 --> 02:09.232
just the first two paragraphs 
in the Appendix there, 


02:09.232 --> 02:12.027
under the heading on page 215, 


02:12.027 --> 02:15.739
“1914-A Significant Year in Bible Prophecy.”


02:15.738 --> 02:20.035
Sure. 
“Decades in advance, Bible students . . .”


02:20.035 --> 02:22.037
Thank you. 


02:22.037 --> 02:26.625
So notice there that Jesus 
said that the city of Jerusalem 


02:26.625 --> 02:29.085
would be “trampled on by the nations 


02:29.085 --> 02:32.965
until the appointed times 
of the nations are fulfilled.” 


02:32.965 --> 02:36.427
Now for us 
to understand Jesus’ words, 


02:36.427 --> 02:40.305
we have to know, 
Why was Jerusalem special? 


02:40.305 --> 02:43.017
What did Jersusalem symbolize? 


02:43.017 --> 02:47.312
So, what did we learn about Jerusalem 
there in paragraph 2?


02:47.312 --> 02:51.525
Um, well, Jerusalem was 
where the Jewish kings ruled, right? 


02:51.525 --> 02:54.445
So they would have ruled for Jehovah, 


02:54.445 --> 02:57.488
which meant that Jerusalem 
was a symbol of Jehovah’s rulership.


02:57.488 --> 02:59.031
Very good. 


02:59.032 --> 03:01.577
Now you have the key 


03:01.577 --> 03:04.997
to understanding 
when Jesus began to rule as king.


03:04.997 --> 03:06.874
Wow, this is really interesting. 


03:06.873 --> 03:08.208
It’s like solving a mystery.


03:08.208 --> 03:21.618
Isn’t it? 
Let’s read the next paragraph.

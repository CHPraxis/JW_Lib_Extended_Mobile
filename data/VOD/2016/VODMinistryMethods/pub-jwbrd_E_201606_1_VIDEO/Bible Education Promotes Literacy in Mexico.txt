00:00 Jehovah’s people have always considered  the studying of his Word
00:04 to be an essential part of life.
00:07 God’s Law to Israel commanded  that the king “must read from [the Law]
00:11 all the days of his life, so that he  may learn to fear Jehovah his God.”
00:16 In the Mayan territories  of Yucatán, Mexico,
00:20 our brothers are helping people  learn to read God’s Word for themselves.
00:25 People’s lives change when they  can finally read the Bible on their own
00:30 and more readily ‘learn  to fear Jehovah their God.’
00:44 One out of every six people on earth  doesn’t know how to read.
00:49 Jehovah’s Witnesses  around the world
00:51 have organized literacy classes  to help such ones.
00:59 I don’t like to read.
01:02 I used to sleep at the meetings.
01:11 In our territory,
01:13 most people speak the Mayan language,  but very few can read it.
01:18 On occasion I would give a talk,  and when I would
01:21 cite a scripture,  most of the audience would look it up.
01:24 But then I would see  a blank stare on their faces
01:27 because they  couldn’t read the text.
01:31 I was moved  to learn how to read
01:34 because I wanted to learn about Jehovah  and study his Word, the Bible.
01:40 So a sister came  to my house to teach me.
01:45 Literacy classes are often conducted  on an individual level.
01:49 After a person has had their Bible study,  they can spend some time
01:53 to practice reading skills.
01:56 But when  the local elders notice
02:00 that there are many  that can benefit from this training,
02:03 they can schedule  a larger class
02:05 at the Kingdom Hall.
02:07 The study material used  for this purpose is the brochure
02:11 Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing.
02:13 It’s available in 30 languages  in the Central America branch territory.
02:20 Other study materials can be used  as well, as long as they help
02:23 the development of the students  enrolled in the class.
02:28 And we use a board  on which we write,
02:31 for instance, words  that are difficult to pronounce.
02:34 This helps in the reading  of complicated words.
02:38 There are some who are,  well, very quick learners.
02:43 On the other hand,  others go word by word.
02:46 But as they practice,  they start getting the hang of it.
02:51 I’m good at masonry work,
02:54 but learning to read
02:58 is not easy.
03:00 Reading at his age  is a big challenge.
03:04 You need to understand  that each student learns differently.
03:08 With some,  you need to be very patient.
03:13 The first word  I learned to write was Jehovah.
03:17 “It’s like this,” I tell him.
03:19 He says, “It’s ‘cause  you’re not being patient with me!”
03:22 Having a sense of humor  is a big help in the learning process,
03:27 so as not to focus  on errors and mistakes.
03:31 Since 1946, when records  began being taken in Mexico,
03:35 more than 152,000 people  have learned to read and write,
03:39 thanks to these training efforts.
03:41 The Secretary of Public Education
03:43 in the State of Mexico  has recognized the work and the great help
03:47 these literacy classes  have been to the local citizens.
03:51 The skills they learn  help in their day-to-day life,
03:53 but also it helps them  to learn more about Jehovah
03:56 and to be able to teach others.
03:59 I used to have to memorize  everything I was going to say,
04:04 but now I can read
04:06 short scriptures to people  directly from the Bible.
04:12 As the students progress  in the class, they demonstrate
04:15 the words found  at 1 Timothy 4:15,
04:18 which says in part
04:21 “so that your advancement  may be plainly seen by all people.”
04:24 And these benefits  are plainly seen in the students.
04:29 My husband was an alcoholic,
04:31 he smoked,  and he used bad language.
04:35 But he made big changes  in his life,
04:38 and we see that this training  has been a big help.
04:42 We really see  these great blessings.
04:45 Reading helped me  to get baptized.
04:50 Helping other people  to improve their reading skills
04:55 makes me feel very happy.
04:57 I feel great because I see  on their face the joy they get
05:01 from reading and understanding  the information.
05:05 Well, I’ve benefited so much.
05:08 For instance,
05:09 now we read the Bible  together as a family.
05:14 It makes me very happy.
05:16 We’re more united as a family.
05:19 Our children  respect my husband more,
05:22 like the father he is.
05:27 Now I’m a ministerial servant.
05:29 When I go preaching  door to door,
05:33 some people say,  “I don’t know how to read.”
05:36 But then I tell them,
05:40 “I didn’t know either,  but I learned about Jehovah.
05:43 And you can too!”
05:48 If I learned to read,  anybody can.

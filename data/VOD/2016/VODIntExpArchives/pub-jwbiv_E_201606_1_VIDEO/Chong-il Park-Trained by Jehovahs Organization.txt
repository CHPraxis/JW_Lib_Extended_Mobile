00:00 When the preaching work  was getting started
00:03 in such countries  as South Korea,
00:06 Jehovah often used missionaries  to help strengthen our brothers.
00:10 In an archived interview,  Brother Chong-il Park
00:13 describes the effect  this had on his sacred service
00:16 and how it prepared him  for the trials he would face.
00:22 From 1939 on,  our brothers
00:26 didn’t have any contact  with Jehovah’s organization,
00:29 and they thought  that no organization existed.
00:34 Then, in 1948,
00:36 a brother  read from a newspaper
00:39 about the activity  of Watchtower Society.
00:42 And it surprised the brothers.
00:45 So brothers wrote the Society,  and the Society
00:48 was so happy  hearing from Korean brothers,
00:52 and they answered
00:54 with many booklets  in Korean.
00:58 There were  two different reactions.
01:01 Some brothers was excited  about preaching work.
01:04 Yet,  another group questioned:
01:07 “Is that true organization  of Jehovah?”
01:11 First missionary group —Brother and Sister Steele—
01:15 arrived on August 9, 1949.
01:20 All the questions  were answered
01:22 by Brother Steele,  and then
01:26 right away  brothers were preaching
01:29 in unity.
01:32 I began pioneering
01:34 in January 1950.
01:38 And then in March 1950,
01:40 six more missionaries  arrived from Gilead School.
01:44 We had only one congregation  in Seoul.
01:47 And the missionaries  were busy for many Bible studies.
01:51 So many interested persons  coming to the meetings.
01:55 The public talk was arranged
01:58 in school auditorium —first time.
02:01 And there were
02:05 over 360 people attended,
02:09 whereas the publishers was
02:14 about 60.
02:19 The same day,  Korean War broke out,
02:22 and the missionaries  had to leave
02:26 on 27th of June
02:29 to Japan.
02:33 And then our brothers  had to take refuge
02:37 to southern part  of Korea.
02:40 I was hiding  in the country.
02:44 Then few days later,
02:46 the secret police  from Communist found us.
02:49 We explained to him
02:51 as a Christian  we cannot participate in the war,
02:55 so we had  to hide ourselves.
03:02 And then he says: “Well,  I do not know much about religion,
03:06 “so I better take  one of my friends
03:11 “who knows about religion.
03:13 “So I will  come back tomorrow.
03:15 Don’t leave from here.”
03:18 So, then,  we waited until next day,
03:22 and he came with another.
03:24 So I started preaching  from the Bible
03:28 about why  this war broke out
03:32 and the many problems  in the world
03:34 and so on,  because the fulfillment
03:37 of Jesus’ prophecy  in Matthew 24.
03:40 And then they say,  “Well, thank you very much
03:42 for your preaching.”
03:45 And then say, “Goodbye.”
03:47 Then two days later,  the latter one came
03:51 with another friend  so that we could preach to them.
03:54 During three months  they were staying in Seoul,
03:58 and, in fact,  they protected us.
04:05 I was picked  by South Korean army
04:10 to serve the back support
04:15 of the military  in front line to carry arms
04:19 to the soldiers,
04:21 which I could not accept,
04:25 so I refused it.
04:29 And then
04:31 I was beaten.
04:36 And then one day
04:38 this company has to move  to another place.
04:41 I hide myself
04:43 in behind the ceiling
04:46 so that they don’t notice
04:50 when they leave the place.
04:52 And the next morning  when I came down,
04:56 there was nothing left.
04:59 I walked on one street,  toward one direction,
05:04 and then I found a sign
05:08 that said  “International Bible Students Association.”
05:11 So I stayed with the brothers  for six months.
05:15 Brother Steele  came back from Japan
05:20 by himself to take care  of the brothers.
05:24 In 1952, Brother Steele  recommended me
05:28 to Gilead School.
05:31 So that I was invited  in 22nd class.
05:36 So I took the steps
05:40 to get the passport.
05:43 And then the government find out  that I didn’t serve in military.
05:48 They gave me draft notice  instead of passport.
05:53 So I had to stand  for the neutrality
05:57 instead of going to Gilead School,  which made me to be confined
06:02 in military prison  for two years.
06:05 Then 1958, I was enrolled
06:09 in Gilead School in 32nd class.
06:14 I really appreciate
06:17 that great Gilead School training.
06:20 Since my job in the branch,  especially in translation work
06:25 —and translation work  involves much deep knowledge—
06:29 the Gilead training
06:32 has certainly helped  in translation work.
06:35 The real appreciation
06:38 about the truth  and the organization,
06:41 the brothers’ qualities,  the humbleness and meekness,
06:46 certainly it helped me
06:50 to follow the examples
06:52 to apply  in the full-time service.
07:01 Did you note what Brother Park  said he appreciated most
07:04 even after enduring persecution  and prison for his faith?
07:08 It was the Christlike qualities  of his brothers
07:11 and the training he received  from Jehovah’s organization
07:15 —another example of the benefits  that result from our meeting together.

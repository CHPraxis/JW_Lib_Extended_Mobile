00:03.812 --> 00:06.002
Do you think it’s about time 
you had more freedom?


00:07.520 --> 00:10.560
You may think you’re ready 
to be treated as an adult, 


00:10.562 --> 00:13.002
but do your parents agree?


00:15.353 --> 00:18.003
Have you proven to them 
that you can handle more freedom?


00:32.270 --> 00:34.770
You see, if you want more freedom, 


00:34.770 --> 00:37.000
you have to gain your parents’ trust.


00:38.062 --> 00:40.482
Earning their trust takes time.


00:40.478 --> 00:43.098
But every time 
you prove yourself responsible, 


00:43.103 --> 00:46.443
you get one step closer to your goal.


00:46.437 --> 00:48.647
Some ways you can show 
 you are trustworthy are: 


00:48.645 --> 00:50.895
diligently completing your chores, 


00:50.895 --> 00:53.225
especially without being reminded; 


00:53.228 --> 00:56.518
managing your time wisely 


00:56.520 --> 00:59.100
and being punctual; 


00:59.103 --> 01:02.443
taking care of your things; 


01:02.437 --> 01:05.997
showing that you can handle 
money in a responsible way; 


01:08.437 --> 01:11.997
and following through 
on the promises you make.


01:14.687 --> 01:16.847
Of course, nobody’s perfect.


01:16.853 --> 01:20.193
So if you make a mistake, 
it’s not the end of the world.


01:20.187 --> 01:23.647
Follow the Bible’s advice 
at Hebrews 13:18 


01:23.645 --> 01:26.765
to conduct yourself 
“honestly in all things.”


01:26.770 --> 01:28.770
Tell the truth 
and be straightforward. 


01:28.770 --> 01:31.230
If you admit your mistake 
and apologize, 


01:31.228 --> 01:33.228
your parents will see 
that you are willing 


01:33.228 --> 01:35.228
to take responsibility 
for your actions, 


01:35.228 --> 01:37.728
and they’ll appreciate 
your honesty.


01:37.728 --> 01:40.478
But what if you feel 
that despite your best efforts, 


01:40.478 --> 01:43.598
your parents still aren’t giving 
you enough freedom?


01:43.603 --> 01:45.653
Don’t just get annoyed


01:45.645 --> 01:47.055
—talk to them!


01:47.062 --> 01:51.692
Respectfully ask what they think 
you need to do to earn their trust.


01:51.687 --> 01:54.897
You may be surprised 
to learn of some other areas 


01:54.895 --> 01:56.995
where you can show 
you’re responsible.


01:59.895 --> 02:03.935
At 2 Corinthians 13:5, 
 the Bible says: 


02:03.937 --> 02:06.397
“Keep proving what you . . . are.”


02:06.395 --> 02:09.645
So you need to build up 
a record of consistency.


02:09.645 --> 02:12.935
That way you’ll prove 
you’re worthy of trust.


02:12.937 --> 02:16.187
Every step you take 
brings you closer to your goal.


02:16.187 --> 02:21.057
Of course, trust is much harder 
to gain than it is to lose.


02:21.062 --> 02:23.102
But the effort is worth it. 


02:23.103 --> 02:26.483
When your parents see you 
working hard to earn their trust, 


02:26.478 --> 02:29.848
they will likely be happy 
to give you more freedom, 


02:29.853 --> 02:30.673
and you’ll be another step closer 
to becoming a responsible adult.

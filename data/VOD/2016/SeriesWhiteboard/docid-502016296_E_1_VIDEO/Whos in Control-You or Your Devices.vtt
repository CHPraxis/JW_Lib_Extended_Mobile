Most people use electronic devices
for things like homework, . . .


00:09.790 --> 00:12.250
. . .research, . . .


00:12.250 --> 00:14.665
. . .social networking, . . .


00:14.665 --> 00:16.623
. . .entertainment, and more.


00:16.623 --> 00:18.623
But if you’re not careful,


00:18.623 --> 00:21.331
you could become
overly attached to your devices.


00:21.332 --> 00:22.999
You could even have withdrawal symptoms


00:22.998 --> 00:24.831
if you’re away from your devices.


00:24.832 --> 00:28.000
This addiction could cost you your job, . . .


00:30.832 --> 00:33.000
. . . your friends, . . .


00:36.457 --> 00:39.000
. . . or more.


00:40.250 --> 00:42.270
Are you addicted to your device?


00:42.270 --> 00:45.540
The Bible says to “make sure
of the more important things.”


00:45.540 --> 00:48.540
So ask yourself these questions:


00:48.540 --> 00:53.957
Do I become uneasy or irritated
when I can’t use my device?


00:53.957 --> 00:57.395
Do I keep using my device
longer than I intended to?


00:57.395 --> 01:01.665
Am I losing sleep because I can’t stop
checking for messages?


01:01.665 --> 01:04.873
Do my devices cause me
to neglect my family?


01:04.873 --> 01:07.456
What would my family say?


01:07.457 --> 01:11.625
If you answered yes to some or all
these questions, don’t give up.


01:11.625 --> 01:13.082
It’s not too late! 


01:13.082 --> 01:14.749
Take back control!


01:14.748 --> 01:17.373
For example, set a time limit. 


01:17.373 --> 01:20.556
Then stick to it!


01:20.557 --> 01:21.499
When driving,


01:21.498 --> 01:24.790
keep your devices 
out of sight and reach.


01:24.790 --> 01:28.000
Suggest that your family try
“phone-stacking” during a meal.


01:29.812 --> 01:34.457
The first one that reaches for it
has to do the dishes.


01:34.457 --> 01:37.082
Set aside a screen-free evening.


01:37.082 --> 01:39.332
And keep your tech out of the bedroom. 


01:39.332 --> 01:42.832
You’ll sleep better.


01:42.832 --> 01:46.000
The Bible says
that “two are better than one.”


01:47.207 --> 01:49.665
Ask a trusted family member or friend


01:49.665 --> 01:51.665
to help you make the needed changes.


01:51.665 --> 01:53.748
At 1 Corinthians 9:25,


01:53.748 --> 01:57.581
the Bible tells us to exercise
“self-control in all things.”


01:57.582 --> 02:00.750
So remember, 
you may live in a wired world, 


02:00.750 --> 02:02.540
but it doesn’t have to control you.


02:02.540 --> 02:04.332
Take breaks from your devices. 


02:04.332 --> 02:12.667
You’ll be happier
and enjoy more out of life.

00:01 For thousands of years,
00:03 people have wondered how life came to be.
00:08 Knowing how we came to be here
00:10 could be an important step toward knowing
00:13 why we are here.
00:16 Although science can explain many things,
00:19 some people feel that it’s not able
00:21 to provide satisfying answers
00:23 to the really important questions,
00:25 questions such as  ‘Is there a purpose in life?’
00:31 They also believe that the natural world
00:34 gives compelling evidence  that life was created.
00:49 Could that evidence  help you find a purpose in life?
00:53 Why not investigate for yourself
00:56 and reach your own conclusion?

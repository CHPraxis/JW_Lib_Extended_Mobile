00:01.480 --> 00:03.898
For thousands of years, 


00:03.898 --> 00:08.028
people have wondered how life came to be.


00:08.028 --> 00:10.405
Knowing how we came to be here 


00:10.405 --> 00:13.158
could be an important step toward knowing 


00:13.158 --> 00:15.000
why we are here.


00:16.912 --> 00:19.080
Although science can explain many things, 


00:19.080 --> 00:21.250
some people feel that it’s not able 


00:21.250 --> 00:23.252
to provide satisfying answers 


00:23.252 --> 00:25.545
to the really important questions, 


00:25.545 --> 00:29.000
questions such as 
‘Is there a purpose in life?’


00:31.760 --> 00:34.930
They also believe that the natural world 


00:34.930 --> 00:38.000
gives compelling evidence 
that life was created.


00:49.237 --> 00:53.449
Could that evidence 
help you find a purpose in life?


00:53.448 --> 00:56.118
Why not investigate for yourself 


00:56.118 --> 00:59.955
and reach your own conclusion?


00:59.955 --> 01:01.957
To learn more, 


01:01.957 --> 01:05.710

01:09.382 --> 01:16.410

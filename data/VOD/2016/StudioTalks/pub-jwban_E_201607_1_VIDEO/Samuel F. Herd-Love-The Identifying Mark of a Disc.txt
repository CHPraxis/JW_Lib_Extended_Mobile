00:00 In the book  Insight on the Scriptures,
00:03 under the heading “Christian,”
00:05 it makes clear that claiming to be Christian
00:08 requires more than simply
00:10 a mere confession of faith.
00:12 It is more than  being a nominal Christian
00:14 —a Christian in name only.
00:17 For example,  according to the Bible,
00:19 it is necessary that belief
00:21 be demonstrated by works,  not just words.
00:25 And since we were born  as sinners,
00:28 those who become Christians  need to repent,
00:31 to turn around,  to dedicate their lives to Jehovah,
00:35 to worship and serve him,
00:37 and then to submit  to water baptism.
00:40 They must keep themselves  clean from fornication,
00:43 from idolatry,  and from consuming blood.
00:47 They are to strip off  the old personality,
00:50 including such things  as fits of anger, obscene talk,
00:54 lying, stealing, drunkenness,
00:57 and as Galatians chapter 5 says:  “things like these.”
01:02 Yes, they are to bring their lives  into accord with Bible principles.
01:07 Christians are to be  kind and considerate,
01:10 mild-tempered and patient,
01:12 and are to exercise self-control.
01:15 They provide  and care for their own
01:17 and love  their neighbor as themselves.
01:20 That’s a lot, isn’t it?
01:23 It’s not a matter  of just glibly saying,
01:27 “I am a Christian.”
01:29 But despite all of those  impressive characteristics
01:32 that we just enumerated,
01:34 what did Jesus say
01:37 the main identifying quality
01:39 of a true Christian would be?
01:42 Most of you know the answer to that,  but let’s read it again
01:46 from John 13:34, 35.
01:51 It says: “I am giving you  a new commandment,
01:55 “that you love one another;  just as I have loved you,
01:59 “you also love one another.
02:02 “By this all will know  that you are my disciples
02:05 —if you have love among yourselves.”
02:10 Those are the theme verses
02:13 for my discussion  with you this month.
02:15 The topic is:
02:17 “Love—The Identifying Mark  of a Disciple of Jesus.”
02:21 Did you notice  in verse 34 that Jesus said
02:25 that he was giving them  at that time a “new commandment”?
02:30 But it sounds like  a very old commandment, doesn’t it?
02:34 Why, over 1,500 years
02:36 before Jesus said  the words we just read,
02:39 the Law given to Moses said:
02:41 “You must love  your fellow man as yourself.”
02:46 —Leviticus 19:18.
02:48 So, what was “new”  about Jesus’ command
02:52 in John chapter 13?
02:54 He said that true Christians  were to love each other
02:58 “just as I have loved you.”
03:02 That is what was different.
03:04 That was new,
03:07 not just love the other person  as you love yourself,
03:10 but love him just like
03:13 Jesus loved His followers.
03:16 Well, what kind of love  would that be?
03:19 Self-sacrificing love —and usually we think
03:23 of Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice,
03:25 his willingly giving his life
03:28 so that we might have the hope  of everlasting life.
03:32 But when you think about it,  that aspect of Jesus’ love
03:36 was exemplified  in a self-sacrificing death!
03:40 Now, it is true,  that as a Christian,
03:43 we might at some time have to give  our life for a fellow Christian.
03:47 But we hope  it doesn’t come to that.
03:49 So instead of talking  about a self-sacrificing death,
03:54 we want to discuss  showing this new kind of love
03:58 as evidenced  in a self-sacrificing life,
04:02 not necessarily our death.
04:05 You see, Jesus’ life —his three-and-a-half-year ministry—
04:10 was a self-sacrificing life  of loving others.
04:15 In addition to doing good
04:19 when something requires it,
04:21 a true follower of Jesus
04:23 is to take  the initiative to help others
04:26 spiritually and otherwise.
04:28 He is to work actively  for their good.
04:32 The preaching and teaching  of the good news to others
04:35 —some of whom may even be hostile—
04:38 is one of the greatest expressions  of love, for it can result
04:43 in everlasting life  to the recipients.
04:46 However,  according to Paul’s words
04:48 at 1 Thessalonians 2:8,
04:52 a true Christian must  ‘impart not only the good news of God
04:57 but also his very self’
05:00 in helping those who  accept the good news.
05:03 It’s that kind of love
05:06 that Jesus said would be  an identifying mark of his disciples,
05:11 not specifically that his followers
05:14 would all be dying for each other,
05:17 but more so that they  would all be living for each other.
05:22 Yes, displaying self-sacrificing love
05:25 for one another  every day of their lives.
05:28 The four Gospels  are a treasure trove
05:31 of Jesus’ self-sacrificing love.
05:34 And yet,  they do not cover his actions
05:37 every day of his life  as the Christ.
05:40 His three-and-a-half-year ministry
05:43 amounts to nearly
1,300 days of life and love.
05:48 The written record  of Jesus’ life is admittedly brief,
05:52 but it is grand indeed!
05:55 However, the reality  of observing Jesus every day
05:59 must have been far grander  than what we have in print.
06:03 What we have in print  might be likened
06:05 to a photo album of Jesus’ life,
06:09 some snapshots.
06:11 By comparison,  what his apostles experienced
06:15 with Jesus day after day
06:18 was like a continuous video  of his example of love.
06:23 No wonder that,  at John 21:25,
06:28 the apostle said:
06:30 “There are also . . .
06:32 “many other things that Jesus did,
06:35 “which if ever they were written  in full detail,
06:39 “I suppose the world itself
06:41 could not contain the scrolls written.”
06:45 It said there were  ‘many other things Jesus did,’
06:50 not many other things  that he said,
06:53 but that he did,  yes, deeds or acts
06:58 demonstrating  his self-sacrificing life of love!
07:01 We already mentioned  the all-important preaching work
07:05 as being an act  of love on our part.
07:08 But how else  do we manifest
07:10 the most obvious trait  of a genuine Christian
07:14 —love like Jesus had?
07:18 Let’s start by thinking  of the elders in the congregation.
07:22 At Philippians 2:17,
07:25 Paul said that he  had ‘poured himself out
07:29 to the congregation  like a drink offering.’
07:32 What did that mean?
07:34 It meant that he  drained himself out,
07:37 both physically and emotionally,
07:39 to support the Philippians.
07:42 Many of the elders  in our congregations
07:44 have the same self-sacrificing love
07:46 for those under their care.
07:48 They give of their time  to shepherd
07:51 and readjust those in need.
07:53 They take the lead  in the ministry.
07:55 They respond when there is
07:57 a serious health issue or tragedy.
07:59 They pour themselves out for the friends,  thus identifying themselves
08:04 as disciples of Christ.
08:07 But we do not have  to be an elder
08:10 to provide a word  of encouragement, do we?
08:13 If we all keep focused  on others in the congregation,
08:17 not just ourselves,
08:19 we will know  who needs to be bolstered
08:22 because of trials  or circumstances that they face.
08:26 Giving in this way  is evidence of Christlike love.
08:31 You may be thinking,  ‘But I’m just a little old sister
08:35 ‘who finds it hard to squeeze out
08:37 a word of encouragement to others.’
08:40 Perhaps you don’t have  to say anything,
08:43 just be there
08:46 at the meetings  or in the service.
08:49 When others see your face,  they are encouraged.
08:52 Follow along  as I read Acts 28:15.
08:57 It reads:  “From there the brothers,
09:00 “when they heard the news about us,
09:03 “came as far  as the Marketplace of Appius
09:06 “and Three Taverns to meet us.
09:08 “On catching sight of them,
09:12 “Paul thanked God
09:14 and took courage.”
09:17 Paul “took courage”
09:20 just by seeing the brothers  who came out to meet him.
09:24 You encourage your brothers
09:26 and sisters by your presence.
09:29 Please follow along as I read
09:31 Philippians 2:1-4.
09:36 Paul here describes it  as “encouragement in Christ.”
09:40 He says:
09:42 “If, then, there is  any encouragement in Christ,
09:46 “if any consolation of love,
09:49 “if any spiritual fellowship,
09:52 “if any tender affection  and compassion,
09:55 “make my joy full by being
09:58 “of the same mind  and having the same love,
10:02 “being completely united,  having the one thought in mind.
10:06 “Do nothing out of contentiousness  or out of egotism,
10:10 “but with humility
10:12 “consider others superior to you,
10:16 “as you look out not only  for your own interests,
10:20 but also for the interests of others.”
10:24 Did you notice  the self-sacrificing aspect
10:27 of this love and encouragement?
10:29 Yes, he talked about having love,  but then he said,
10:33 “not . . . for your own interests,  but . . . for the interests of others.”
10:38 That type of love —in the interests of others—
10:42 is the identifying mark  of true Christians.
10:46 What about visiting  the sick in your congregation
10:49 or those who are housebound?
10:51 Sometimes these dear ones are  “out of sight, out of mind.”
10:56 We visit with those we see  when at the Kingdom Hall,
11:00 but do we think about those  who are shut-ins?
11:05 What was a major part  of Jesus’ loving acts when on earth?
11:09 There are numerous accounts  of Jesus and his apostles
11:13 healing the sick.
11:15 It’s true that we  cannot heal the sick,
11:18 but it is in our power  to visit the sick.
11:23 And what a healing  that is to their spirit!
11:26 It means so much when
11:28 they are not just prayed for  at a meeting,
11:32 but when those words of prayer  are backed up
11:35 with an act of love —a visit to them in person.
11:39 That is Christlike love in action.
11:44 Why not scroll down the list of those in your service group
11:49 with the thought in mind  of checking on those
11:51 who have been missing  from the meetings?
11:54 Do they need a meal?
11:56 Do they need some help
11:59 perhaps around the house?
12:01 Do they need transportation  to the doctor?
12:04 Can we allow our love  to expand to fill their needs?
12:09 Contributing to the worldwide work,
12:11 which cares for the needs  of our brothers around the world,
12:14 is another act of love.
12:16 It demonstrates that we are  a true disciple of Christ.
12:21 Related to that, many of you have,  at your own expense,
12:25 traveled to far-flung places
12:28 to help rebuild  after a natural disaster has struck.
12:32 The overwhelming response  from the victims is evidence
12:36 of your self-sacrificing life  and love for your brothers.
12:41 It is hoped  that the reminder of Jesus
12:44 at John 13:34, 35  will be good for all of us,
12:48 not just for this month,
12:51 but for our whole course of life.
12:54 You know, about one third  of the world’s population
12:58 claims to be Christian.
13:00 But how many of them  show self-sacrificing love
13:04 outside of their immediate family?
13:07 Most are like a baseball team  in a uniform.
13:10 They think having the word “Christian”
13:13 emblazoned across the front  of their uniform
13:16 is all that is required.
13:18 However, most of them  simply “sit on the bench,”
13:22 or on a pew in church,
13:25 and many do not even attend  “the game.”
13:28 They do not live  the life of a Christian.
13:32 Jesus made clear  that being a true disciple of his
13:36 is not merely  “wearing a uniform,”
13:39 simply claiming to be  his follower.
13:42 No, it involves
13:44 actively demonstrating  works of love,
13:48 “swinging hard for the team,”
13:50 imitating the all-time greatest examples  of love,
13:55 Jehovah God and his Son,  Jesus Christ.
13:58 As Paul said  at 2 Corinthians 8:8,
14:02 we need “to test  the genuineness of [our] love.”
14:07 Yes, we need to daily prove
14:10 that we are  a genuine disciple of Jesus.

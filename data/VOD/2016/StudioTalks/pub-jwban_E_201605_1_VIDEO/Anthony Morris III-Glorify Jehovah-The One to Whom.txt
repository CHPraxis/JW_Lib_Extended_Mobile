00:00 I would first like to read to you  some passages from the Bible
00:05 found at Ephesians chapter 3,
00:08 verses 14 through 19.
00:11 This will also establish the theme  for my comments this month.
00:16 Ephesians 3,  starting with verse 14, Paul said:
00:21 “For this reason  I bend my knees to the Father,
00:25 “to whom every family in heaven  and on earth owes its name.
00:30 “I pray that he may grant you  through the abundance of his glory
00:34 “to be made mighty  in the man you are inside,
00:37 “with power through his spirit,
00:40 “and that through your faith you may have  the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.
00:44 “May you be rooted  and established on the foundation,
00:48 “in order that with all the holy ones  you may be thoroughly able
00:52 “to comprehend fully  what is the breadth
00:55 “and length  and height and depth,
00:58 “and to know the love of the Christ,  which surpasses knowledge,
01:02 “so that you may be filled  with all the fullness
01:06 that God gives.”
01:08 Now, verse 15
01:10 is the inspiration  for my theme, namely,
01:13 “Glorify Jehovah—The One  to Whom Every Family Owes Its Name.”
01:20 The family unit is under a vicious attack  in these last days.
01:25 The Insight book  lived up to its name
01:28 under the heading “Family.”
01:30 The very insightful comment  reads this way:
01:35 “The inspired Scriptures  have foretold a vicious attack
01:39 “on the family institution  with a consequent breaking down of morality
01:44 and of human society  outside the . . . congregation.”
01:49 The article pointed out  that in “‘the last days’
01:54 “a condition in which  disobedience to parents,
01:58 “disloyalty, and absence  of ‘natural affection’ would be rife,
02:03 even among those  ‘having a form of godly devotion.’”
02:07 How can married couples,  parents, and children
02:12 counteract  such a diabolical attack?
02:16 Do you remember those verses  we read in Ephesians chapter 3?
02:21 Verse 16 said that the One  to whom every family owes its name,
02:26 Jehovah, would ‘grant us  to be made mighty
02:29 in the person we are inside.’
02:31 Yes, Jehovah can give us
02:34 the internal  spiritual strength to fight back
02:38 against Satan’s efforts  to destroy the family.
02:42 How?
02:44 By being immersed in God’s Word.
02:47 In particular,  by imitating the loving way
02:51 that Jesus treated his disciples.
02:54 Did you note  that Ephesians 3:17 said
02:58 we are to “have the Christ  dwell in [our] hearts with love”?
03:02 Yes, if each of us cherishes  the Christ in our hearts
03:07 to the point that he dwells,  or resides, there constantly,
03:11 our family  will not only survive
03:14 but it will truly thrive.
03:17 This will be so evident  that verse 17 further states
03:21 that we will “be rooted  and established on the foundation.”
03:25 We will be solid!
03:28 And keep in mind  that 1 Corinthians 3:11 says
03:32 that the “foundation”  on which we build
03:34 “is Jesus Christ.”
03:37 Then verse 18  of Ephesians chapter 3 indicates that
03:42 our spiritual peripheral vision  will be enhanced.
03:46 We will not  have spiritual blind spots
03:48 that could allow the spirit of the world  to creep into the family.
03:53 That verse says  that we will “be thoroughly able
03:56 “to comprehend fully  what is the breadth
03:59 and length  and height and depth.”
04:02 All aspects of Jesus’ personality  will come into play
04:06 as we interact  with family members.
04:09 Finally, verse 19  sums up the result when it says
04:13 that we would then  have come “to know the love of the Christ,
04:18 which surpasses knowledge.”
04:20 Granted,  knowledge is important,
04:24 but it is the application
04:27 of Christlike love  that will preserve our family,
04:31 keeping it vibrantly intact.
04:34 Family life  in these critical last days
04:38 could be likened to those  who suffer from diabetes.
04:41 It is believed  that diabetes is caused
04:43 by both genetic  and environmental factors.
04:47 Similarly, all in the family  have inherited sin
04:51 and imperfection  from our first human parents,
04:53 Adam and Eve,  as if genetically.
04:56 However, we are also exposed  to the ever more toxic
05:01 environmental factors  of Satan’s evil world.
05:05 Most who suffer  from a serious case of diabetes
05:08 need to use two methods
05:11 to successfully relieve the symptoms  and lead a normal life.
05:15 They have to watch their diet  and, in many cases,
05:18 take an injection  of insulin daily.
05:23 Spiritually,  we need to avoid the sickly,
05:26 sweet junk food  that the world promotes in movies,
05:30 talk shows,  the Internet, and in print.
05:35 Just as with the person  who has diabetes,
05:37 this requires  a permanent lifestyle change
05:40 from what we might have  exposed ourselves to in the past.
05:44 In addition to avoiding
05:46 unwholesome junk food  from Satan’s system,
05:49 we also need  to take daily “injections”
05:51 of God’s Word  and other wholesome provisions.
05:55 This has become more  and more important
05:58 the deeper we get  into these last days.
06:03 How has our organization provided this  when it comes to family life?
06:08 Well, in the early 1900’s,
06:12 the focus was on preaching  the good news.
06:14 Little attention was given
06:16 to building strong  Christian marriages and families.
06:20 For a time,  marriage was even discouraged
06:23 well beyond  the intent of the Scriptures.
06:26 I did some checking,  and commendably
06:29 between 1919 and 1921
06:33 there was a feature  in the Golden Age magazine
06:36 once or twice a month  called the “Juvenile Bible Study.”
06:40 In 1920,  a brochure was released
06:43 called The Golden Age ABC.
06:46 Then it wasn’t until 1941  that the now famous book
06:50 entitled Children was handed out
06:52 to all young ones  at the convention that year.
06:56 But as the last days progressed,
07:00 more and more information  for families was produced.
07:04 For example, in the 1970’s,
07:07 the book Making Your Family Life Happy  was released.
07:10 About the same time,  the books Listening to the Great Teacher
07:14 and Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It  were published.
07:18 In 1982, Awake!  began a regular series
07:22 that has run for decades  entitled “Young People Ask.”
07:26 We now have two up-to-date books  with the same title,
07:30 and the series of articles  continues on the jw.org website.
07:35 We have the book  Learn From the Great Teacher
07:38 and so many features  and activities for young ones
07:42 on the website that I would be out of time  if I tried to enumerate them all.
07:47 There are also regular articles  in our magazines
07:50 about marriage  and family life.
07:53 And I will certainly never forget  the privilege I had in 2012
07:58 to introduce the animated series  Become Jehovah’s Friend.
08:03 That has proved  to be a blessing
08:05 for both young ones  and their parents.
08:09 What a teaching tool for both!
08:13 In 2014, I attended  the international convention
08:18 in Atlanta, Georgia,  here in the United States.
08:22 After a little two-year-old girl  saw my face
08:25 on the big jumbo screen  giving a talk,
08:28 she eagerly started searching  all around her for someone.
08:32 When her parents asked her  who she was looking for, she said, “Caleb.
08:36 He must be here because I saw  his grandfather giving a talk.”
08:41 Many children ask
08:43 to meet Caleb in person  when they visit Bethel.
08:47 Two postings  of an item every month
08:49 is making quite an impression  on little hearts.
08:53 With Bible principles  being impressed on the minds and hearts
08:57 of children so early,  we prayerfully anticipate
09:01 many spiritually-minded teenagers  in the years to come.
09:06 We have so much  healthy spiritual food
09:10 for counteracting  family “diabetes.”
09:13 For this,  we give all glory to Jehovah,
09:17 the one “to whom  every family . . . owes its name.”
09:22 One of the favorite passages  of Scripture that anyone
09:26 professing to be Christian  loves is the 23rd Psalm.
09:31 Family heads, can we benefit
09:34 from imitating not only  the Fine Shepherd, Jesus,
09:37 but also the Great Shepherd,  Jehovah God?
09:42 I am going to borrow  the text of the 23rd Psalm
09:45 and adjust the words so that we  can sense a family’s tranquillity
09:50 when headship  is exercised properly.
09:53 In fact, you husbands,
09:56 as the script is read,  imagine it is your wife’s voice
10:01 describing the effect  your headship has on your family.
10:08 ‘[My husband]  is [our] shepherd.
10:12 ‘[We] will lack nothing.
10:14 ‘In grassy pastures  [refreshing recreation]
10:18 ‘he makes [us] lie down;  he leads [us]
10:21 ‘to well-watered resting-places  [meetings and conventions].
10:26 ‘He refreshes [us].
10:29 ‘He leads [us in the ministry]
10:31 ‘in the paths of righteousness  for the sake of [Jehovah’s] name.
10:36 ‘Though [we] walk in the valley  of deep [economic] shadow,
10:40 ‘[we] fear no harm,  for [Dad is] with [us];
10:45 ‘your rod and your staff  [loving discipline] reassure [us].
10:49 ‘You prepare a table [of family worship,  helping the children]
10:53 ‘for [us] before [our] enemies.
10:55 ‘You refresh  [our] head[s] with oil;
10:58 ‘[Our] cup  [of family well-being] is well-filled.
11:03 ‘Surely goodness and loyal love  will pursue [our family]
11:07 ‘all the days of [our] life,  and [our family]
11:11 will dwell in the house  of Jehovah for all [our] days.’
11:17 No further application called for.
11:21 We feel the sense of security  that envelops
11:24 the interior rooms  of such a home, don’t we?
11:29 Do you remember  the point made
11:31 in Ephesians chapter 3,  which we read earlier?
11:35 We are to treasure  Jesus’ personality
11:38 and let it “dwell”  in our hearts.
11:41 If all in the family  make a determined effort
11:44 to treat each other  like Jesus would,
11:46 we can conquer the world!
11:49 Yes, we—His spiritual family  in heaven
11:52 and all humans on earth  who dedicate their lives to Him
11:56 —give glory to Jehovah!
11:58 Indeed, we thank Jehovah
12:01 for all the spiritual provisions  he has made through his Word
12:05 and organization to protect every family  who takes up his name.
12:10 May Jehovah bless  all of you families
12:13 as you strive to win  the war that Satan wages
12:16 against you  in these last days.

00:02 Our worldwide brotherhood  is truly special.
00:05 When our brothers are in need,
00:08 we want to help  in whatever way possible.
00:10 It also brings us great joy  to be with our brothers
00:13 —whether at the meetings,  in the field service,
00:16 or on other occasions.
00:18 We love our brothers  and enjoy spending time with them.
00:22 At the same time,  because we are all imperfect,
00:25 our love and unity will be tested.
00:28 We may have our feelings hurt,
00:31 or we may hurt the feelings of others.
00:34 That brings me to the theme  I would like to discuss
00:37 with you  in this month’s program,
00:39 “Settling Differences  Brings Jehovah’s Favor.”
00:44 It is based on Matthew 6:14.
00:47 Let’s read  this important verse together.
00:50 Right after teaching  his disciples how to pray,
00:53 Jesus says in verse 14:
00:58 “For if you forgive  men their trespasses,
01:02 your heavenly Father  will also forgive you.”
01:05 To what extent do Jesus’ words  affect how Jehovah
01:08 views what we do each day  in our worship to him?
01:12 Consider this:
01:14 You’re concluding  your day in prayer.
01:16 You pray for Jehovah’s name  to be sanctified.
01:20 You pray  for his Kingdom to come.
01:22 You ask that he bless  the Governing Body
01:25 and the brothers taking the lead.
01:27 You share with him  a few matters
01:29 of personal concern.
01:31 And then you say: “Jehovah,
01:33 “I know I am imperfect,
01:35 “and I sin against you often.
01:37 “Please forgive me  for my sins.
01:40 “Let me stand before you
01:42 in a clean  and approved state.”
01:46 Now the question is,
01:48 Has Jehovah heard  your heartfelt request?
01:52 Will he forgive you?
01:55 Well, what did Jesus say?
01:57 Look again at verse 14:
02:00 “For if you forgive  men their trespasses,
02:03 your heavenly Father  will also forgive you.”
02:07 Did you notice  Jesus’ use of the word “if”?
02:11 That tells us that forgiveness  is not automatic.
02:14 It comes with a condition, or price.
02:17 What price?
02:18 According to Jesus,  ‘if we forgive others,’
02:22 the condition has been met;
02:24 the price has been paid.
02:26 What will Jehovah do for us?
02:29 Jesus said:  “[He] will also forgive you.”
02:34 Really, though,  is it fair or reasonable
02:37 for Jehovah to say to us,
02:39 ‘Only if you forgive others,
02:41 then I will also forgive you’?
02:44 Well, suppose you  get very sick and lose your job.
02:48 You’re unable  to pay rent for many months.
02:51 Your situation is desperate.
02:54 You have very few, if any, options.
02:57 You worry about your wife  and your children.
03:01 Say you go to the owner  of the house and ask
03:03 if he would give you time  to get back on your feet.
03:07 Once you get better  and are able to work again,
03:10 you will do everything  within your power
03:12 to pay him what you owe.
03:15 He tells you not to worry.
03:17 He understands your situation.
03:20 He will cancel your debt,
03:22 and you do not have  to pay him any rent
03:24 until your situation improves.
03:26 In fact, he’ll cover  your monthly expenses
03:29 until you are able  to care for your family.
03:33 How would you feel  about what he has done,
03:36 and would this affect  how you treat others?
03:41 Well, because of our sinful nature,
03:43 we are all in debt to Jehovah
03:46 —deserving of death.
03:48 We are unable  to cover our expenses.
03:51 But when we go  to Jehovah in prayer
03:53 and beg for his help,
03:55 in his great mercy and kindness,
03:58 he tells us not to worry.
04:00 He has given the life  of his Son to pay our debt.
04:05 And on the basis of that sacrifice,
04:07 He is willing to cover our expenses
04:10 —the sins we commit daily—
04:12 and to extend forgiveness  to us until we are able
04:16 to get back on our feet,
04:18 when we reach perfection  in the new world.
04:22 So think again about those  simple yet powerful words
04:25 of Jesus at Matthew 6:14:
04:28 “For if you forgive  men their trespasses,
04:32 your heavenly Father  will also forgive you.”
04:35 Is that fair?
04:37 Is that reasonable?
04:39 Is it realistic?
04:41 Without a doubt!
04:43 In fact, settling differences,
04:45 or forgiving others freely,
04:47 is one of the best ways to imitate
04:50 Jehovah’s compassionate  and merciful nature.
04:55 What can help us  to settle differences quickly?
04:59 The first thing  we should do is to try
05:01 and let love cover  over the wrong.
05:04 Can I just forgive and forget?
05:07 If we are able to do so,
05:09 this is a beautiful way to maintain
05:11 the congregation’s peace and unity.
05:15 But if we’re struggling  to forget the wrong,
05:18 there are two scriptures  that are especially helpful
05:21 in this matter  of settling differences.
05:23 They are Matthew 5:23, 24
05:27 and Matthew 18:15-17.
05:32 Keep in mind that these texts
05:34 are not referring  to the same scenarios,
05:37 nor are they to be applied
05:39 in the exact same way.
05:41 Matthew chapter 5
05:43 has a broader application
05:45 and can be used to bring peace
05:47 in most situations.
05:49 Matthew chapter 18
05:52 has a more limited application
05:54 and applies to specific situations
05:57 that are more serious in nature.
06:01 Now let’s consider the first text,
06:03 Matthew 5:23, 24:
06:07 “If, then,  you are bringing your gift to the altar
06:10 “and there you remember that  your brother has something against you,
06:13 “leave your gift there  in front of the altar, and go away.
06:18 “First make your peace  with your brother,
06:20 and then come back  and offer your gift.”
06:24 To truly capture  what these two brief verses mean
06:27 for you and me today,
06:29 we have to understand  what Jesus’ words meant
06:32 to his first-century Jewish listeners.
06:35 Picture the scene in your mind  as we transport ourselves
06:38 into the city of Jerusalem  some 2,000 years ago.
06:42 It is during one  of the annual festivals.
06:45 There are tens of thousands  of people in the city.
06:49 You are there to make your sacrifice —a beautiful lamb.
06:53 The best one you have.
06:55 It’s clean and unblemished.
06:57 You take the lamb  through a series of courts
07:00 all the way  to the Court of Priests.
07:03 It has taken you  most of the day to get there.
07:06 Now you’re ready  to put your hands on that animal
07:09 and offer a prayer for forgiveness,
07:12 and then you remember something.
07:14 What?
07:15 Verse 23 reads:
07:18 “If, then, you are bringing  your gift to the altar
07:21 “and there you remember  that your brother
07:23 has something against you,”
07:25 Now you think:  ‘My brother
07:28 ‘does have  something against me!
07:30 ‘The last time I saw him,
07:32 ‘he greeted  everybody else but me.
07:34 ‘He was upset.  But what is it?
07:37 ‘I don’t remember  doing anything.
07:39 ‘He is so sensitive!
07:41 He’s always upset  with something.’
07:46 Did Jesus  have all of that in mind
07:48 when he said  what he did in verse 23?
07:51 No!
07:52 He did not go into detail
07:54 about what  that “something” might be.
07:57 He doesn’t say  who is right or wrong.
08:00 He doesn’t make a comment
08:02 about whether someone is too sensitive,
08:04 always getting upset,  never satisfied,
08:07 difficult to get along with.
08:09 Why not?
08:10 Because the reason  behind the “something”
08:13 is not the important thing.
08:16 What is the important thing?
08:18 That the peace  has been disturbed.
08:22 There is a difference  that needs to be settled.
08:25 The lack of peace  between brothers
08:27 could affect their relationship  with Jehovah.
08:30 That is important!
08:32 So what should be done?
08:35 We see the answer in verse 24:
08:38 “Leave your gift there
08:40 “in front of the altar,  and go away.
08:43 “First make your peace  with your brother,
08:46 and then come back  and offer your gift.”
08:49 That animal sacrifice  is important too.
08:51 There’s no doubt about that.
08:53 It represents worship to Jehovah
08:56 —like going to the meetings,  in the field service,
08:59 sharing in family worship.
09:01 But according to Jesus,
09:03 what is more important?
09:05 It is settling the difference
09:09 —making peace  with our brother first.
09:12 Then we will be  in an acceptable position
09:15 to offer our gift  of worship to Jehovah.
09:19 Yes, settling differences  will bring Jehovah’s favor.
09:24 But when can we apply the principle of Matthew 5?
09:28 Whenever there is  a difference to be settled.
09:31 Perhaps our brother  misunderstood what we said or did.
09:35 Or maybe he didn’t misunderstand
09:37 —maybe we did give him  a valid reason to be hurt.
09:40 Regardless, we notice
09:42 that he has something against us.
09:45 In that case, we make peace.
09:49 We can also use  the principles of this text
09:52 when we are hurt or have something
09:54 against our brother.
09:56 We can take the initiative ourselves
09:58 to settle misunderstandings,
10:00 to resolve differences,
10:02 and to make peace  with our brother.
10:04 Again, Jehovah blesses  such a spirit.
10:10 Now, open your Bible  to Matthew chapter 18.
10:14 We mentioned earlier that it has
10:16 a more limited application.
10:18 How so?
10:20 Notice verse 15:
10:23 “Moreover,  if your brother commits a sin,
10:26 “go and reveal his fault  between you and him alone.
10:30 If he listens to you,  you have gained your brother.”
10:34 Here Jesus says,  “if your brother commits a sin.”
10:38 That is much different  than just having
10:40 “something against [us].”
10:42 We are talking about a situation  that is much more serious.
10:46 What situation?
10:48 The revised  Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will book,
10:51 page 136, explains
10:53 that it “involves financial  or property matters,
10:57 “such as failing to repay a loan
10:59 “or committing fraud.
11:01 “Or the offense  might be slander,
11:04 which seriously affects  someone’s reputation.”
11:08 Of course,  they are sins that could be resolved
11:10 between the individuals concerned
11:13 but are also serious enough
11:15 to merit expulsion  from the congregation if not settled.
11:20 Before we start applying  Matthew 18:15,
11:23 we should first consider  whether it is really necessary
11:26 to pursue the matter.
11:28 Could we simply  forgive the individual
11:31 for what was done  or even take the loss
11:33 if it were a financial matter?
11:36 That is a personal decision.
11:39 If we decide to pursue the matter,
11:42 what do we do?
11:44 Jesus helps us in verse 15,  when he says
11:47 that we reveal his fault
11:49 between the two of us alone.
11:51 We do not discuss  the matter with others,
11:54 attempting to get them  to side with us.
11:57 We do not go  straight to the elders
11:59 and try to get them  to solve the problem for us.
12:02 No, we try to resolve the matter between us.
12:06 And since our goal  is to settle the difference,
12:09 maintain our relationship  with Jehovah,
12:12 and help our brother do the same,
12:14 we make repeated efforts  to speak with him
12:17 when our initial efforts  are unsuccessful.
12:21 Keep in mind  that Jesus did not say:
12:23 “Go only once  and reveal his fault.”
12:28 When applying this first step,  make it clear
12:31 that your motive  is to ‘gain your brother.’
12:34 Also, it would be helpful  to clearly state
12:37 that you are applying  the first step in settling differences
12:40 as outlined by Jesus  at Matthew 18:15.
12:43 Of course,  this would be stated in a kindly,
12:47 nonthreatening manner
12:49 but still in a way  to show the seriousness
12:51 of getting the matter settled.
12:55 What if the first step
12:57 in gaining your brother is unsuccessful?
13:01 Notice verse 16 explains step 2:
13:04 “But if he does not listen,
13:06 “take along with you  one or two more,
13:09 “so that on the testimony  of two or three witnesses
13:12 every matter  may be established.”
13:15 Yes, we talk with him  in the company of one or two more.
13:19 Would that be our best friends?
13:21 No.
13:23 The whole purpose  is to ‘gain our brother.’
13:25 Teaming up with two  of our best friends
13:28 could alienate our brother.
13:30 Instead, it makes sense
13:32 that we would choose  other mature Christians.
13:36 How would mature Christians  be helpful?
13:39 Well, are we  misunderstanding things?
13:42 Could they help him  to reason about the matter?
13:45 Could a solution be found?
13:48 Having spiritually mature witnesses there
13:51 may help to resolve the matter.
13:54 Generally, applying steps 1
13:56 and 2 will result  in gaining your brother
13:59 and preserving the peace  of the congregation.
14:03 If he does not respond  to these repeated efforts
14:07 to help him, then what?
14:09 You have a decision to make.
14:13 Are you willing  to forgive your brother,
14:15 even take a loss  if a financial matter is involved?
14:20 If you choose  to pursue the matter further,
14:23 listen to Jesus’ words recorded
14:25 at verse 17:
14:27 “If he does not listen to them,
14:30 “speak to the congregation.
14:32 “If he does not listen  even to the congregation,
14:35 “let him be to you  just as a man of the nations
14:38 and as a tax collector.”
14:41 At this point,  the body of elders
14:44 representing the congregation  will get involved.
14:47 They will review  the facts of the case and determine
14:50 if a judicial committee  should be appointed.
14:53 Happily, though,  these situations are rare,
14:57 and matters  are often resolved peacefully
14:59 before reaching  such a serious point.
15:04 Think back again  to that heartfelt prayer to Jehovah.
15:07 Has Jehovah heard  our sincere requests?
15:11 Will he forgive?
15:13 Well, at this moment,
15:15 if you realize there is a difference  with your brother
15:19 that needs to be settled,
15:21 pray to Jehovah about the matter.
15:23 Ask him to help you see
15:25 beyond the emotion  and make peace.
15:28 Do not let any more time go by!
15:34 Once we have followed  the simple steps outlined by Jesus
15:37 and have forgiven others,
15:39 the condition has been met;
15:41 the price has been paid.
15:44 Then what will Jehovah  do for us?
15:46 Jesus said:
15:48 ‘He will also forgive us.’
15:50 As a result,  we will gain the peace of mind
15:54 that comes with a clean conscience,
15:56 knowing that we have  Jehovah’s favor and blessing.
16:00 We can then  make a valuable contribution
16:03 to the beautiful,  united brotherhood
16:06 that we are privileged  to be a part of.

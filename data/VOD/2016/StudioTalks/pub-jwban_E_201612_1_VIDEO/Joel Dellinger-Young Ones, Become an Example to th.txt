00:01 During the past five years,
00:04 over 1.3 million faithful ones
00:07 have symbolized their dedication
00:09 to Jehovah by water baptism.
00:11 That’s an average  of over 700 each day.
00:16 And among those courageously taking their stand
00:19 for true worship are thousands of children,
00:22 teenagers, and young adults.
00:25 Young brothers and sisters,
00:27 we know it is not always easy
00:29 to serve Jehovah and live up to your dedication.
00:32 Like older ones,
00:34 you need to be encouraged and strengthened spiritually.
00:38 With that in mind, our theme this month is
00:42 “Young Ones, ‘Become an Example to the Faithful Ones.’”
00:46 It is based on the inspiring true-life story
00:50 of a young Christian named Timothy.
00:53 Before we discuss Timothy’s example,
00:56 did you know that the Bible specifically foretold
00:59 that many young people would take  sides with Jehovah in our time?
01:04 Let’s look at this at Psalm 110:3.
01:08 And as we read it together,
01:10 note how young ones are having a share  in fulfilling this prophecy.
01:15 Notice the first part of verse 3,
01:18 David sang:
01:21 “Your people will offer themselves willingly
01:24 on the day of your military force.”
01:27 According to this prophecy, Jesus, the Messianic King,
01:31 would have a large army of willing supporters.
01:35 Since 1914, millions have carefully investigated the facts
01:39 and chosen to side with Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.
01:43 But where do young ones come into this picture?
01:46 The rest of the verse continues:
01:49 “In splendid holiness,  from the womb of the dawn,
01:53 “you have your company of young men
01:57 just like dewdrops.”
02:00 Here, the prophecy refers to a “company,” or group, of young ones.
02:04 They also would study the evidence and support God’s Kingdom.
02:10 How many young people did Jehovah foresee
02:13 supporting true worship?
02:15 We get an idea by the comparison made to dewdrops.
02:18 Have you have ever gone outside early in the morning
02:22 and noticed a light, sparkling coating of water on the ground?
02:26 That may have been dew.
02:29 Jehovah designed our atmosphere so that, under certain conditions,
02:33 when the temperature cools during the night,
02:35 a blanket of moisture forms on the ground.
02:39 That coating is made up of a multitude of little drops.
02:44 Young ones, what does dew have to do with you?
02:49 In the Bible, dew is connected with blessing and abundance.
02:53 Dewdrops are also refreshing,
02:56 life-sustaining, and numerous.
02:58 Now, remember in Psalm 110:3,
03:01 Jehovah was looking ahead to our time.
03:05 And what did he see?
03:08 The September 15, 2002, Watchtower on page 8
03:12 explained it this way:
03:14 “Just like refreshing dewdrops,
03:17 “many young men and women cheerfully serve God
03:21 and assist their fellow worshipers.”
03:23 Today, there are so many mature,
03:27 bright, happy young ones in the Christian congregation
03:31 that they are like countless dewdrops that sparkle in the morning sun.
03:36 You faithful children, teenagers,
03:39 and young adults who have dedicated your life to Jehovah
03:43 or who are working toward that goal
03:45 are living proof that Jehovah’s confidence
03:48 in young people was never misplaced.
03:51 He cherishes you very much and so do we.
03:57 Of course, knowing that Jehovah has confidence in us
04:01 can be very encouraging.
04:03 But what if doubts or negative thoughts
04:07 tend to bring us down?
04:09 On occasion, a young Witness might wonder,
04:12 ‘Does anyone other than Jehovah notice me?
04:16 Does my example really matter to others?’
04:21 To address these questions,
04:23 let’s now consider Timothy’s example.
04:26 Open your Bible, please,
04:28 to our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12.
04:34 When you find it,  you might want to bookmark the verse
04:37 because we want to first understand the setting.
04:41 How old was Timothy at this time?
04:44 Often, when thinking of Timothy,
04:47 I picture a teenager or a young man in his early twenties.
04:51 And when he first started traveling with Paul,
04:53 he was about that age.
04:55 But several years passed  before Paul wrote letters to Timothy.
05:00 So by the time First Timothy was written,
05:03 Timothy was likely in his early thirties.
05:06 Now, what do you think?
05:08 Was Timothy young or old?
05:13 Some of you younger ones may be thinking to yourselves,
05:16 ‘If he was over 30, then he was old!’
05:20 But remember, a much older man like Paul
05:23 would say that Timothy was quite young.
05:26 In fact, notice the expression he uses when writing to Timothy.
05:30 First Timothy 4:12, Paul says:
05:34 “Never let anyone look down on your youth.
05:39 “Instead, become an example  to the faithful ones
05:43 “in speaking, in conduct, in love,
05:47 in faith, in chasteness.”
05:51 Paul called Timothy a youth and urged him to be a good example.
05:56 While Timothy may have been in his early thirties at this time,
06:00 remember that he was taught about Jehovah
06:03 from the time he was a baby,
06:05 and he did well in the truth as a young person.
06:08 In fact, when he was still a teenager or in his early twenties,
06:12 the elders recommended him to serve as a missionary with Paul.
06:16 So, in effect,  Paul here is urging Timothy
06:20 to continue to be  a good example for others.
06:25 What else do we know about Timothy?
06:29 He was not proud, or haughty.
06:32 He likely did not view himself as some amazing example.
06:37 I’m sure he never dreamed that one day Christians all over the world
06:41 would study his life in detail so as to imitate his faith.
06:47 Timothy was modest —and this despite his privileges.
06:52 Paul’s words may indicate that Timothy was somewhat shy.
06:56 Like many of us,
06:58 he may have battled with feelings of self-doubt on occasion.
07:02 Based on this information, let’s do something interesting now.
07:06 Let’s use our imagination to visualize Timothy,
07:11 an elder in his early thirties,
07:13 coming to give a Scriptural talk in the congregation.
07:16 Got the picture?
07:18 In your mind, please look at Timothy
07:21 and then look at the audience.
07:23 Who do we see?
07:26 Many in attendance are old enough
07:28 to be Timothy’s parents or grandparents.
07:31 How do you think Timothy felt?
07:34 Super confident?
07:36 Are you visualizing him proudly walking into the meeting place, saying,
07:40 “I sure wish my friends back in Lystra could see me now.
07:44 Look at the crowds that come to hear me speak!”
07:49 No, that’s not the Timothy we know.
07:53 It’s much more likely that Timothy,  like most of us,
07:57 rehearsed his presentation over and over again.
08:01 He probably prayed constantly,
08:04 and he probably still got nervous, like all of us.
08:08 And remember, Timothy did not have the benefit
08:11 of theocratic schools like we do today.
08:14 In summary,
08:16 what can we say about Timothy?
08:19 Like so many of you,
08:22 he was an example of faith and obedience.
08:26 He was exceptional in displaying Christian qualities,
08:29 such as modesty and humility.
08:32 But Timothy was a person with normal human feelings,
08:36 like all of us.
08:37 Though he had a rich, happy life in Jehovah’s service,
08:41 life in the old world brought real tests and challenges.
08:44 Timothy also dealt with frequent cases of sickness,
08:48 and he was imprisoned for a time.
08:51 Some of you in various countries
08:54 can relate to those bitter experiences.
08:57 But Timothy endured.
09:00 Was he some “super Christian” with superpowers?
09:04 No, but he did prove to be a super example!
09:10 How does all of this help you Christian youths
09:13 who have taken the commendable step
09:15 to dedicate your lives to Jehovah?
09:19 We just read how Paul told Timothy to let no one look down on his youth.
09:23 A few of you may be thinking,
09:27 ‘I wish someone would tell my parents
09:30 ‘or my elders not to look down on me.
09:33 They still treat me like a little kid.’
09:37 If that’s the case,  we feel for you.
09:40 No progressive young one wants to be treated as if he were a child.
09:46 But let’s look again at 1 Timothy 4:12.
09:50 Is the apostle Paul speaking to the congregation,
09:53 to parents, or to the elders?
09:57 “Never let anyone look down
10:00 “on your youth.
10:02 “Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking,
10:07 in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”
10:12 It’s clear, isn’t it?
10:14 Paul said your youth.
10:17 He was speaking only to Timothy.
10:20 Young ones, by extension, what is Jehovah saying to each of you?
10:25 It’s this: To gain and maintain the respect of faithful ones,
10:30 you have to work at proving yourself as a Christian.
10:35 The key is not wanting or hoping that others will respect you.
10:40 Rather, it’s earning such respect by setting a good example
10:44 in all areas of life.
10:46 If you do that,
10:47 then no one will have any legitimate reason to look down on your youth.
10:52 Doesn’t it make sense that we gain respect by earning it?
10:58 We are confident that you young ones are trying hard
11:01 to live by Christian principles at school and in the neighborhood.
11:05 But in verse 12, did you notice who Timothy was to be an example to?
11:11 To “the faithful ones.”
11:13 Are you an example to Christians, both younger and older,
11:17 in your congregation  and in your circuit?
11:20 If you work on Kingdom Hall construction projects or at Bethel,
11:23 are you an example to your fellow workers?
11:28 Well, what are some specific ways you can become an example
11:32 to all of these “faithful ones”?
11:35 In our theme text,  Timothy was first directed
11:38 to become an example in speaking.
11:42 On this topic, I’ll never forget an illustration
11:45 used in the “Young People Ask” article from the January 2012 Awake!
11:50 It quoted a young man, James, who said:
11:54 “Once you squeeze toothpaste out, you can’t put it back in the tube.
11:59 “The same is true with our words.
12:01 Once we say something hurtful,  we can’t take it back.”
12:05 God’s Word agrees with James.
12:08 Note what it says at Ephesians 4:29.
12:14 It tells us:
12:16 “Let a rotten word not come out of your mouth,
12:20 “but only what is good for building up as the need may be,
12:24 to impart what is beneficial to the hearers.”
12:28 For some years now, those getting baptized
12:31 have been encouraged  to complete a study of the book,
12:33 “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.”
12:35 Chapter 12 is entitled “Speak What ‘Is Good for Building Up.’”
12:41 On page 140,  there is a box with five questions
12:45 that can help us evaluate our speech.
12:48 For example:
12:49 “When was the last time I offered someone specific commendation?
12:54 “Do I express my respect for others by saying please and thank you?
12:59 “In conversation, do I speak mainly about myself,
13:03 or am I also interested in the thoughts and feelings of others?”
13:08 Young ones,  over the next few days,
13:11 why not review that box on page 140,  look up the scriptures,
13:15 and think about what Jehovah is saying?
13:19 Then apply what you learn to your speech.
13:22 Doing this will draw you closer to Jehovah
13:25 and help you to become an even better example
13:29 to the faithful ones.
13:32 The second area mentioned in our theme text
13:35 is becoming an example in conduct.
13:38 Of course, upbuilding speech would be empty
13:41 or hypocritical if our conduct was questionable.
13:46 Think again about Timothy.
13:48 It wasn’t enough for him to give comments and talks at the meetings
13:52 or preach from door to door.
13:54 Later in the same letter, Paul reminded Timothy
13:57 that he needed to treat older men and women as fathers and mothers;
14:01 younger men and women were to be treated as brothers and sisters.
14:07 Second Peter 3:11
14:10 provides a similar urgent reminder about our conduct.
14:14 Let’s read that together.
14:16 Again, that’s 2 Peter 3:11.
14:20 There it tells us:
14:22 “Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,
14:26 “consider what sort of people you ought to be
14:29 in holy acts of conduct.”
14:33 Let’s think about that.
14:34 For a person’s conduct to be holy from Jehovah’s perspective,
14:39 he or she must be morally clean.
14:42 While physical cleanness is on the outside,
14:45 moral cleanness is on the inside —in our thoughts and desires.
14:51 Is being morally clean really important?
14:53 Think about it this way.
14:55 When eating a meal,  would you be content to eat from a bowl
15:00 that had been washed only on the outside?
15:03 Of course not!
15:04 We want to eat from clean dishes
15:06 —dishes that are thoroughly clean inside and out.
15:10 So when we wash dishes, we wash the outside and the inside.
15:15 Similarly,  Jehovah expects his servants
15:18 to be clean through and through.
15:21 And because Jehovah —the perfect reader of hearts—
15:25 will soon dissolve, yes, eliminate this dirty system of things,
15:29 it’s urgent that we do so.
15:32 This means that we have to work very hard
15:35 so that nothing unclean enters our mind.
15:38 That means firmly rejecting
15:41 so-called fun and exciting entertainment,
15:44 which features sex, violence, or spiritism.
15:47 At 1 Corinthians 14:20,  the Bible tells us
15:52 that we should become like “young children as to badness.”
15:57 No matter our age,
15:59 we don’t need and we don’t want
16:01 any experience  with the wickedness of this world.
16:05 Rather,  we keep the inside of the dish,
16:08 our mind and heart, clean at all times.
16:11 And when we do so, our exemplary conduct
16:15 pleases Jehovah and it strengthens our faithful brothers and sisters.
16:20 Really, it’s the only way to respect ourselves
16:23 and to gain the respect of others.
16:26 Our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12
16:29 goes on to mention other areas
16:32 where we can make steady progress in becoming an example,
16:35 such as in love, in faith, and in chasteness.
16:40 During your personal study,
16:42 that is, your personal time with your best Friend, Jehovah,
16:46 why not examine these areas in more detail?
16:49 The treasures you gain from such a study project
16:52 can last a lifetime —an everlasting lifetime.
16:58 So, what have we learned?
17:00 In fulfillment of Bible prophecy,
17:02 a large company of young people  from around the world
17:06 are taking a stand with Jehovah and Jesus.
17:10 That includes all of you.
17:13 Like dewdrops, you’re not only abundant in number
17:17 but you sparkle in our congregations.
17:20 Your presence is very refreshing.
17:23 So please, don’t look down on your youth.
17:28 Rather, rejoice in your youth!
17:30 Yes, “become an example  to the faithful ones”!

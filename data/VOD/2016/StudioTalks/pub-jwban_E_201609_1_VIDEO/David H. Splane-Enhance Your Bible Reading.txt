00:01 Have you enjoyed studying the book
00:03 Imitate Their Faith as much as I have?
00:06 It’s a wonderful book,  isn’t it?
00:09 And I was particularly captivated  by the introduction.
00:12 There was a point in the introduction
00:15 that encouraged us  to use our imagination
00:18 when we’re reading the Bible:
00:20 to see the sights,  to hear the sounds,
00:22 to smell the aromas,  to try to capture the feelings
00:26 of the individuals  that we are reading about.
00:30 Now, of course, we don’t want  our imagination to run away with us,
00:33 but at the same time,  we do want to get
00:35 a solid mental picture  of what we’re reading.
00:39 And that’s what I’d like  to talk to you about today.
00:42 When you’re reading the Bible,  try to get the whole picture.
00:46 Now we’ll use a couple  of well-known Bible accounts to illustrate.
00:53 Have you been raised  in a stepfamily or a blended family?
00:58 If you have,  did you know that you have
01:01 something in common with Joseph,  the son of Jacob?
01:04 Joseph was raised  with ten half brothers
01:08 in a large blended family.
01:12 So now you want to try to view
01:15 this family as a composite.
01:18 You want to try to figure out  how did people mesh
01:21 or how did they clash  within this family.
01:24 What would you do?
01:26 Well, you might start by writing down  some of the characteristics
01:29 of the individual members  of the family.
01:32 What about Joseph’s half brothers  and Joseph himself?
01:35 What do you know about them?
01:37 What about Judah,  Simeon, Levi,
01:41 Dan, Naphtali —what do you know?
01:44 So write down  their characteristics,
01:46 and try to figure out  how they might get along.
01:49 Sometimes there is  one individual incident
01:53 that’s recorded in the Bible,
01:55 but we mustn’t forget:
01:58 People’s actions  have a way of affecting other people.
02:02 So when you read  about a certain incident in the Bible,
02:05 try to imagine who  might have been affected by that incident.
02:09 Take an example.
02:11 In the book of Genesis,  we read that Jacob’s son Reuben
02:16 committed sexual immorality  with Bilhah.
02:21 Well, that had an effect  on other people without doubt.
02:24 Who was Reuben?
02:26 He was Leah’s oldest son.
02:29 Who was Bilhah?
02:31 Rachel’s handmaiden.
02:33 Do you think that there might have been  a little animosity or tension
02:36 between Leah and Rachel sometimes,
02:40 especially when you consider  how their marriages started out?
02:45 There may have been.
02:46 And it may be  that the attitudes of the women
02:50 had some bearing on the attitudes of their sons as well.
02:53 So you take all of these things  into consideration.
02:56 Now, Bilhah had two sons,  Dan and Naphtali.
03:01 How do you think  they felt when they learned
03:03 that their oldest brother,  or half brother,
03:06 had committed fornication  with their mother?
03:09 So there could have been  tension there.
03:12 And this all goes into the mix
03:14 when we’re considering  the family as a composite.
03:18 Now, do you picture  Joseph at age 17
03:22 with ten much older half brothers,  maybe in their 30’s,
03:27 some old enough to be his father?
03:30 Not true.
03:32 The truth is that there was only  a seven-year age difference
03:36 between Joseph’s oldest brother,  Reuben, and Joseph himself.
03:41 In fact, 11 of Jacob’s sons
03:44 were born  during the seven-year period
03:46 when Jacob  was working for Laban.
03:50 Eleven sons in seven years,
03:53 how is that possible?
03:55 It’s easy, when you remember  that Jacob had two wives
03:59 and two concubines,  or secondary wives.
04:03 So there didn’t have to be  a nine-month interval
04:05 between the birth  of the children.
04:08 In fact, some could have been born  just about at the same time;
04:11 they could have been  the same age.
04:14 So when Joseph  was sold into slavery at age 17,
04:18 his oldest brother  was no more than 24.
04:22 Some of his brothers were only  a year or two older than Joseph himself.
04:27 So we’re talking  about a group of young men
04:30 in their late teens  and early 20’s,
04:32 and this might explain  some of the hotheaded reactions
04:36 that some  of those young men had.
04:40 Well, so much for the boys.
04:42 What about their father, Jacob?
04:44 What can we learn about him?
04:46 A lot.
04:48 For one thing,  he was a spiritual man.
04:51 Now, this is something  for you young brothers and sisters
04:53 who are contemplating  marriage to think about.
04:56 Jacob was willing  to go to any length
04:59 to keep his relationship  with Jehovah intact.
05:03 Let’s take an example:
05:05 Genesis 29:18.
05:09 You can follow along  on the screen as I read this.
05:12 And we’re talking  about marriage here.
05:16 Genesis 29:18.
05:18 It says:  “Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel,
05:22 “so he said:  ‘I am willing to serve you seven years
05:27 for your younger daughter Rachel.’”
05:30 Now what’s the takeaway?
05:32 Jacob didn’t marry  the first person who came along,
05:36 maybe some pagan woman.
05:38 He didn’t say,  ‘Well, seven years is too long to wait.
05:40 I’m going to find some Philistine woman,  and I’ll marry her.’
05:44 He was willing to wait  so that he could marry someone
05:47 who would join him  in the worship of Jehovah.
05:51 And you young folks,  if you are willing to wait,
05:54 you can be sure that you will have  Jehovah’s blessing as well.
05:58 Now Jacob was apparently also  a bit of a romantic.
06:02 Notice verse 20.
06:04 It says:  “And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,”
06:08 but notice this,
06:10 “but in his eyes  they were like just a few days
06:13 because of his love for her.”
06:16 Now, isn’t that poetic?
06:19 Jacob may have learned  to treasure his wife
06:22 by observing his parents,  Isaac and Rebekah.
06:25 It appears that they  had a strong marriage.
06:27 Just notice what we read
06:30 at Genesis 26:8,
06:35 Genesis 26:8.
06:40 It says:  “After some time had passed,
06:42 “Abimelech king of the Philistines  was looking out of the window,
06:47 and he saw Isaac,”  that’s Jacob’s father,
06:50 “displaying affection  for Rebekah his wife.”
06:55 So it appears  that Isaac and Rebekah
06:59 had a warm relationship,  a good marriage.
07:04 Now, what else  can we learn about Jacob?
07:07 There’s an interesting detail recorded
07:09 in chapter 25 and verse 27.
07:13 It says:  “As the boys got bigger, Esau,”
07:17 Jacob’s brother,
07:19 “became a skilled hunter,  a man of the field,
07:22 “but Jacob was a blameless man,
07:25 dwelling in tents.”
07:28 So Jacob liked to dwell in tents.
07:32 That might explain  the strong bond that developed
07:36 between Jacob and Joseph,  who was his youngest for many years.
07:42 Now although Jacob  liked to dwell in tents,
07:45 he was by no means a sissy.
07:47 He was a strong man,  but he was a spiritual man.
07:52 That’s something  for you young brothers to take away.
07:56 You want to be strong,  we know you do,
07:58 but spirituality  should come first.
08:03 One time, spiritual Jacob  gave his sons a beautiful lesson
08:08 on how to settle  a difference with a family member.
08:11 We read about it  at Genesis chapter 32.
08:15 And I think all of us can learn  from his example.
08:19 We learn at Genesis 32
08:21 that Jacob’s brother, Esau,  was coming to see him.
08:25 Now, they hadn’t seen  each other for 20 years,
08:28 and to say that their parting  had been difficult is an understatement.
08:33 The fact is that when they separated  more than 20 years earlier,
08:37 Esau had vowed that one day  he was going to kill his brother;
08:42 now he was coming to see him.
08:44 Now, why was he  so angry with Jacob?
08:48 It’s because Jacob had received  a blessing from their father,
08:53 and Esau was not happy.
08:56 So Esau arrives,
08:58 and 400 men are with him.
09:01 Why 400 men?
09:03 Well, the Bible doesn’t say.
09:05 But it could be  that he was trying to show
09:07 how important and prominent  he had become.
09:12 How did Jacob react?
09:14 Did he try to go tit for tat?
09:16 Did he try to show how important  and prominent he had become
09:21 with all of the blessings  he’d received?
09:23 Did he reopen old wounds?
09:27 Did he argue with his brother?
09:30 Did he say,  ‘You know I was right all along,
09:33 and you, Esau,  you have been wrong’?
09:35 Did he demand an apology?
09:38 No.
09:40 There was a lot that Jacob  could have bragged about.
09:43 No question about that.
09:45 There was no doubt that Jacob  had Jehovah’s blessing.
09:47 Early on,  we read that an angel of Jehovah
09:51 had appeared to him  and said:
09:53 “I am Jehovah
09:55 “the God of Abraham your father  and the God of Isaac.
09:59 “The land on which you are lying,
10:01 “to you I am going to give it  and to your offspring.
10:05 “I am with you,
10:07 “and I will safeguard you  wherever you go . . .
10:10 I will not leave you.”
10:14 Well, that’s quite a blessing,  isn’t it?
10:16 But there’s more.
10:18 For a portion  of the previous night
10:20 —that is, the night before Esau  and Jacob met up—
10:24 Jacob had wrestled with an angel,
10:27 and as a result,
10:28 he had managed  to receive another blessing.
10:33 But Jacob didn’t flaunt  his blessings.
10:36 Instead, he humbled himself.
10:39 In fact, he even bowed down  seven times before his brother
10:43 in front of his wives  and his 11 sons.
10:48 So Jacob settled  any lingering difference with Esau
10:52 not with his fists,
10:54 not with a bragging tongue,  not with a weapon,
10:58 but humbly,  like a real man
11:01 —like a real, spiritual man.
11:06 In contrast,  how did Jacob’s ten sons
11:10 settle their difference  with Joseph?
11:13 Like a bunch of cowards.
11:15 It was 10 to 1  against Joseph.
11:18 First, they decided  to kill their brother,
11:22 and then they delivered him  up into slavery.
11:25 Those jealous young men  didn’t learn a thing
11:28 from their father’s  excellent spiritual example.
11:32 Well, if you’re on the outs  with a member of your family,
11:36 if you had  a serious difficulty with someone,
11:40 could you try to settle the matter  peacefully as Jacob did?
11:45 If the person tries to apologize,  be gracious about it.
11:49 Don’t make it difficult  for him to apologize.
11:51 Don’t dredge up
11:53 all of the unnecessary details  about the past.
11:56 You may be in the right,  as Jacob was,
11:59 but isn’t the important thing  to make peace?
12:03 Jehovah loves the peacemakers.
12:07 Well, what else  do we learn about Jacob?
12:10 We learn that he wasn’t  his father’s favorite.
12:13 Let’s look  at Genesis chapter 25
12:19 verse 28.
12:21 “And Isaac loved Esau
12:26 “because it meant game in his mouth,
12:29 whereas Rebekah loved Jacob.”
12:33 Now, this story may resonate  with many of you out there,
12:37 especially if you’ve grown up  in a large family
12:40 or perhaps you’ve had  a number of brothers and sisters.
12:43 Now, we know  your parents claim
12:45 that they always treated  all of you the same,
12:47 that they never ever  had a preference.
12:50 But ask the kids,
12:52 Was there anyone in the family  who was the favorite?
12:55 They all know.  ‘She was!’
12:57 They know this.
12:58 The parents don’t realize it,  but they are giving preferential treatment.
13:03 And so this happens,  and it can be disconcerting at times.
13:07 Imagine this scenario:
13:09 Imagine that you have a couple  who have two children, two sons.
13:13 One is a pioneer.
13:15 He has never given his parents  a moment’s grief.
13:18 The other  never accepted the truth,
13:21 but he has done well  in business,
13:24 and as a result,  he has been generous to his parents,
13:28 and the parents are grateful,  very grateful.
13:33 And the pioneer  often hears the parents bragging
13:36 about the successes  that his brother has had in business.
13:41 Well, the pioneer can’t help  the parents materially very much,
13:44 and so he feels that there’s  a bit of partiality there.
13:48 Is it hurtful?
13:50 Yes.  That is life.
13:52 It’s chemistry.  It’s just chemistry.
13:55 But the pioneer needs to realize
13:58 that Jehovah God  appreciates his work.
14:00 His heavenly Father  loves him very much
14:03 for the work  that he is doing for His name.
14:06 Now, Jacob must have known
14:09 that Isaac loved his brother  more than he loved him.
14:12 And perhaps he vowed  that when he had children,
14:15 he would treat them all the same.
14:17 Well, if he did,  he didn’t keep that promise, did he?
14:21 Everyone knew  that Joseph was the favorite.
14:26 Well, have you noticed what we had to do  to make a composite of this family?
14:31 We had to read  from several different chapters of the Bible
14:34 —Genesis 25, 26, 28, 29, 32.
14:41 You can’t always get  a complete picture of an incident
14:44 by reading just one chapter,  just by reading the chapter you are reading.
14:47 Sometimes you have to extract details  from other chapters of the Bible.
14:54 Now let’s consider  one more example
14:56 where getting the complete picture  can enrich our understanding.
15:00 This is going to be  a shorter one.
15:02 We’re going to consider   the story of Naaman.
15:05 Now, you remember the story.
15:07 At 2 Kings 5:1,
15:10 we learn that Naaman  was the chief of the army
15:14 of Ben-hadad II,  the king of Syria.
15:18 But he was a leper.
15:20 Now Ben-hadad learned  that there was a prophet in Israel
15:23 Elisha who could heal him  of his leprosy.
15:27 And so he told Naaman  that he should go to Israel
15:30 and go to the prophet  and get healed.
15:33 And so word was sent  to the king of Israel by letter,
15:37 and the king of Israel was asked  to send Naaman to Elisha.
15:42 Now, when you think of it,  this was a strange request
15:45 because Israel and Syria  were often at odds.
15:48 Sometimes there were  wars between them,
15:51 and now, here you have  the king of Syria sending his general,
15:55 the one who is going to head  the army against Israel,
15:58 and saying: ‘Well, I’d like my general  to be a more effective general.
16:01 Could you please make sure  that he gets healed?’
16:03 Well, somehow,  he’s sent to Elisha
16:06 and Elisha kindly heals Naaman
16:10 and Naaman becomes  a worshipper of Jehovah.
16:14 Well, we can imagine,
16:16 remember we’re talking  about using our imagination,
16:18 we can imagine  that when Naaman returned to Syria,
16:22 Ben-hadad had lots of nice things  to say about Elisha.
16:27 So then, everyone lived  happily ever after, right?
16:31 If we didn’t read on,  we might think so.
16:35 But that’s not  the end of the story.
16:37 In the next chapter,  chapter 6,
16:41 we learn that Ben-hadad  declared war against Israel.
16:46 Now, if Naaman  was still the chief of the army,
16:49 he’d be in an awkward position.
16:52 Was he going  to lead the armies of Syria
16:54 against fellow worshippers  of Jehovah?
16:57 But it gets worse.
16:59 Ben-hadad learns that Elisha
17:03 is revealing the Syrians’ war strategies  to the king of Israel,
17:08 so he sends a large army  to capture Elisha
17:11 —the very man who  had healed his general.
17:15 So much for gratitude.
17:17 Now, it’s interesting  that Naaman is not mentioned
17:21 as being at the head  of those armies.
17:24 Did he get out of it somehow?
17:26 Don’t ask me.
17:28 If he’s resurrected,  you’ll have to ask him.
17:32 What lesson can we learn?
17:34 That the gratitude of the world  is fleeting.
17:38 Some of us may get excited  if there’s a favorable article
17:41 about Jehovah’s Witnesses  in a newspaper
17:44 or if some TV personality  makes a kind statement about us.
17:48 But what did Jehovah God say?
17:50 Genesis 3:15:
17:52 “I will put enmity  between you and the woman.”
17:56 So Jehovah’s organization  and Satan’s organization
17:59 are always going to be at odds.
18:03 Bible reading isn’t a chore.
18:05 It’s a joy.
18:07 Get the whole picture  of what you’re reading,
18:10 and you’ll enjoy it even more.
18:12 We wish you all  Jehovah’s rich blessing
18:15 as you continue  to enhance your appreciation
18:19 for this sacred volume.

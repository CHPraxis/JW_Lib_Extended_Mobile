00:00:06 The Democratic Republic of the Congo,
00:00:09 also called the DRC,
00:00:11 is an African country that is almost one quarter the size of Europe.
00:00:16 Yet, despite the challenges, Jehovah’s Witnesses successfully
00:00:21 distribute Bibles and Bible-based publications
00:00:24 to the people of Congo.
00:00:31 This journey begins at the South Africa branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:35 commonly known as Bethel.
00:00:37 Journals and other publications are printed here,
00:00:41 and these are loaded onto trucks traveling to Congo.
00:00:44 Each month,
00:00:45 these trucks pass through many borders
00:00:48 —a journey of 4,500 kilometers.
00:00:55 It will take about 21 days to travel toward the equator,
00:00:59 cutting through some of the most challenging conditions in Africa
00:01:03 to arrive safely at the Kinshasa branch office in Congo.
00:01:07 But some of the literature still has a long way to go.
00:01:13 From Kinshasa,
00:01:14 a boat will travel up the Congo River
00:01:17 for 14 days,
00:01:18 covering a distance of 1,200 kilometers.
00:01:30 It is in this part of the journey
00:01:32 that the literature crosses the equator to reach Bumba.
00:01:41 Because infrastructure is limited,
00:01:44 bicycles and motorcycles
00:01:46 are the most practical means of transport on land.
00:01:51 In Bumba,
00:01:52 the local Witnesses quickly coordinate efforts
00:01:55 to deliver the literature on time.
00:02:08 Philippe volunteers to travel
00:02:10 from Bumba to Yandongi,
00:02:12 a village about 100 kilometers away,
00:02:15 with a load of 180 kilograms on his bicycle.
00:02:21 I try to make the trip in only two days
00:02:24 so I can be back to study the Bible with my family.
00:02:32 On another route,
00:02:33 he travels from Bumba to Bondo.
00:02:36 This 425-kilometer trek
00:02:38 takes seven days one way.
00:02:43 The roads are badly maintained,
00:02:44 and when it rains,
00:02:46 the state of the roads is terrible —a catastrophe.
00:02:55 When I arrive at the brothers with the literature,
00:02:58 everyone receives me with cries of happiness.
00:03:02 They are the ones who off-load my bike,
00:03:04 keep it upright, and off-load the packages.
00:03:07 By then, I am sitting somewhere, and I feel very content.
00:03:14 Matthieu will travel 200 kilometers upstream in his canoe
00:03:19 to deliver literature to Mombongo.
00:03:24 He is one of the volunteers who helps transport the literature
00:03:26 on its epic journey every month.
00:03:29 It usually takes him four days, depending on the weather.
00:03:32 For me, this journey is like working at Bethel.
00:03:37 When I’m in the dugout canoe, I feel like I’m in a floating Bethel.
00:03:41 When we arrive, the brothers welcome us with love.
00:03:45 They are really happy and thank Jehovah for the provision
00:03:48 given by his organization to have the literature reach them on time.
00:03:54 The Watchtower  is published simultaneously
00:03:57 in over 240 languages around the world.
00:04:02 This epic journey into the far reaches of Congo
00:04:05 is one example of the efforts Jehovah’s Witnesses make
00:04:09 to share the Bible’s lifesaving message.

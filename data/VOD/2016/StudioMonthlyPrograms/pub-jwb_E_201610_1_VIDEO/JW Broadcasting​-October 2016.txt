00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting!
00:04 Here’s what we  can look forward to in our program:
00:08 What if your courtship  reveals problems you didn’t expect?
00:12 Part 3 of the Preparing for Marriage series
00:16 will show us how we  can “calculate the expense”
00:19 when considering marriage.
00:21 We go to Australia  to meet Viv and Ann Mouritz.
00:25 Their life of full-time service  has taken them around the world.
00:29 What advice do they have  for those who are deciding
00:32 what form  of sacred service to pursue?
00:36 And we’ll enjoy  a music video that highlights
00:38 the theme of our program.
00:40 It will encourage us to settle differences  with our brothers and sisters
00:44 and to forgive one another.
00:47 This is the October 2016 edition
00:51 of JW Broadcasting!
01:12 We begin with a report from Ukraine.
01:15 In 2014,  political tensions in eastern Ukraine
01:19 boiled over  into a full-blown military conflict.
01:23 Within months,
01:25 over 7,600 Witnesses
01:28 needed to flee the area  to seek refuge.
01:30 Others sheltered in their homes.
01:33 How did our brothers  survive physically
01:36 and spiritually  through the fighting?
01:38 Relief was organized  from hundreds of miles away
01:41 at the branch office in L’viv.
01:44 In the following interviews,
01:46 our brothers and sisters  describe the love and care
01:49 they received from the organization  and from each other.
02:09 It happened that the hostilities
02:11 started without warning,
02:13 and the brothers needed to flee quickly.
02:19 There was not enough food;
02:21 there was nothing in the stores;
02:23 there was a lack of medicine;
02:25 there was no water,
02:27 no electricity.
02:29 It was scary.
02:31 There was no stability at all.
02:33 We did not know what to do.
02:36 Should we stay, or should we leave?
02:41 There were triplets;  they were seven years old.
02:45 As soon as they  got into the shelter,
02:47 they started singing  a Kingdom song.
02:53 The adults  also joined them in singing,
02:55 and because of that,  we couldn’t hear the explosions
02:58 that were happening outside.
03:02 True, we ran out of foodstuffs,
03:04 and we had no money.
03:06 But I knew we would be able to get by.
03:09 God would not let us die of hunger.
03:12 Because the shelling was happening so often, it was impossible
03:16 to conduct our usual meetings.
03:18 We also couldn’t organize the ministry  in the normal way.
03:23 It was just too dangerous.
03:25 When we received the first reports  about the unrest in the east,
03:29 our Branch Committee gathered
03:31 and we prayerfully analyzed  the situation.
03:34 We asked Jehovah for wisdom —how to act,
03:37 how to help our brothers  to be spiritually and physically safe.
03:41 We were also sending regular update reports to the Governing Body.
03:44 More than 156 tons of food
03:47 and 21 tons of clothing donated
03:51 by local brothers have been distributed
03:53 to fellow believers  and also to some non-Witnesses.
03:56 We had been told  that we would be receiving
03:59 about five tons of relief supplies.
04:01 So we were astounded  when instead of 5 tons,
04:05 we received 15 tons!
04:07 It was lovely to find little notes
04:09 that our brothers  and sisters had written
04:12 and included in the packages.
04:16 Brothers from neighboring cities responded
04:18 and offered their homes,
04:21 provided foodstuffs
04:23 and, more importantly,  their brotherly hospitality.
04:27 So we are ready to make sacrifices,
04:29 to adjust our schedules,
04:31 and to even take time  out from our families
04:34 to render practical help  to our brothers.
04:39 For example, beginning at 6 a.m.,
04:42 I would visit  the brothers and sisters
04:45 and bring them  the things that they needed.
04:49 So during two and a half months of war
04:53 and two months of reconstruction,
04:55 I rode my bicycle
04:57 6,500 kilometers.
05:01 The local elders from Slavyansk
05:04 organized small congregations
05:06 and regularly conducted meetings
05:08 to support them spiritually.
05:11 Major repairs  have been carried out on 20 houses
05:14 of brothers and sisters,  and minor repair work
05:17 was done on 72 houses  and apartments.
05:21 We prepared two more programs.
05:23 This time, not only  for the congregations in the war zone
05:27 but for the whole country of Ukraine,
05:29 even for Russia and Belarus.
05:31 We even had 325,000  in attendance.
05:36 An interesting experience
05:38 was the response of the people  who were not Jehovah’s Witnesses.
05:42 They belong to another religion,  yet they said:
05:46 “You are the only ones  that really care.
05:49 Your genuine love  is shown by your deeds.”
05:52 This is what makes us different
05:55 from all other religions.
06:00 This unselfish love  shown by our brothers
06:02 did not go unnoticed  by my husband and my son.
06:06 My husband  started studying the Bible,
06:08 and he regularly attends  the meetings now.
06:11 Recently, he enrolled  in the Theocratic Ministry School.
06:17 I experienced this love personally,
06:20 and I started studying  the Bible again with the brothers.
06:24 Now I am preparing for baptism.
06:27 Unfortunately,  one of our sisters was killed.
06:31 I realized that a person can lose
06:34 —lose everything, but that
06:38 is really nothing  compared to losing your children.
06:42 The brothers and sisters listened to us.
06:44 We cried together.
06:46 I just can’t put it into words.
06:49 It is as if Jehovah  is holding you in his arms
06:52 —he doesn’t let you fall—
06:54 as if he is saying to you:
06:56 ‘Don’t let go, my dear one.
06:59 I’m helping you.  I’m supporting you.’
07:03 With Jehovah there are no borders  between nations.
07:07 I could see  that this was the true religion.
07:13 We continue to pray  for our brothers in Ukraine.
07:17 We’re confident  of Jehovah’s love for them,
07:20 and we know he’ll sustain them  through any tribulation.
07:26 Our worldwide brotherhood  is truly special.
07:29 When our brothers are in need,
07:32 we want to help  in whatever way possible.
07:34 It also brings us great joy  to be with our brothers
07:37 —whether at the meetings,  in the field service,
07:40 or on other occasions.
07:42 We love our brothers  and enjoy spending time with them.
07:46 At the same time,  because we are all imperfect,
07:49 our love and unity will be tested.
07:52 We may have our feelings hurt,
07:54 or we may hurt the feelings of others.
07:58 That brings me to the theme  I would like to discuss
08:01 with you  in this month’s program,
08:03 “Settling Differences  Brings Jehovah’s Favor.”
08:08 It is based on Matthew 6:14.
08:11 Let’s read  this important verse together.
08:13 Right after teaching  his disciples how to pray,
08:17 Jesus says in verse 14:
08:22 “For if you forgive  men their trespasses,
08:25 your heavenly Father  will also forgive you.”
08:29 To what extent do Jesus’ words  affect how Jehovah
08:32 views what we do each day  in our worship to him?
08:35 Consider this:
08:37 You’re concluding  your day in prayer.
08:40 You pray for Jehovah’s name  to be sanctified.
08:44 You pray  for his Kingdom to come.
08:46 You ask that he bless  the Governing Body
08:49 and the brothers taking the lead.
08:51 You share with him  a few matters
08:53 of personal concern.
08:55 And then you say: “Jehovah,
08:57 “I know I am imperfect,
08:59 “and I sin against you often.
09:01 “Please forgive me  for my sins.
09:04 “Let me stand before you
09:06 in a clean  and approved state.”
09:10 Now the question is,
09:12 Has Jehovah heard  your heartfelt request?
09:16 Will he forgive you?
09:19 Well, what did Jesus say?
09:21 Look again at verse 14:
09:24 “For if you forgive  men their trespasses,
09:27 your heavenly Father  will also forgive you.”
09:31 Did you notice  Jesus’ use of the word “if”?
09:34 That tells us that forgiveness  is not automatic.
09:38 It comes with a condition, or price.
09:41 What price?
09:42 According to Jesus,  ‘if we forgive others,’
09:46 the condition has been met;
09:48 the price has been paid.
09:50 What will Jehovah do for us?
09:53 Jesus said:  “[He] will also forgive you.”
09:58 Really, though,  is it fair or reasonable
10:01 for Jehovah to say to us,
10:03 ‘Only if you forgive others,
10:05 then I will also forgive you’?
10:08 Well, suppose you  get very sick and lose your job.
10:12 You’re unable  to pay rent for many months.
10:15 Your situation is desperate.
10:18 You have very few, if any, options.
10:21 You worry about your wife  and your children.
10:25 Say you go to the owner  of the house and ask
10:27 if he would give you time  to get back on your feet.
10:31 Once you get better  and are able to work again,
10:34 you will do everything  within your power
10:36 to pay him what you owe.
10:39 He tells you not to worry.
10:41 He understands your situation.
10:44 He will cancel your debt,
10:46 and you do not have  to pay him any rent
10:48 until your situation improves.
10:50 In fact, he’ll cover  your monthly expenses
10:53 until you are able  to care for your family.
10:57 How would you feel  about what he has done,
11:00 and would this affect  how you treat others?
11:05 Well, because of our sinful nature,
11:07 we are all in debt to Jehovah
11:10 —deserving of death.
11:12 We are unable  to cover our expenses.
11:14 But when we go  to Jehovah in prayer
11:17 and beg for his help,
11:19 in his great mercy and kindness,
11:22 he tells us not to worry.
11:24 He has given the life  of his Son to pay our debt.
11:29 And on the basis of that sacrifice,
11:31 He is willing to cover our expenses
11:34 —the sins we commit daily—
11:36 and to extend forgiveness  to us until we are able
11:40 to get back on our feet,
11:42 when we reach perfection  in the new world.
11:46 So think again about those  simple yet powerful words
11:49 of Jesus at Matthew 6:14:
11:52 “For if you forgive  men their trespasses,
11:56 your heavenly Father  will also forgive you.”
11:59 Is that fair?
12:01 Is that reasonable?
12:03 Is it realistic?
12:05 Without a doubt!
12:07 In fact, settling differences,
12:09 or forgiving others freely,
12:11 is one of the best ways to imitate
12:13 Jehovah’s compassionate  and merciful nature.
12:19 What can help us  to settle differences quickly?
12:23 The first thing  we should do is to try
12:25 and let love cover  over the wrong.
12:27 Can I just forgive and forget?
12:31 If we are able to do so,
12:33 this is a beautiful way to maintain
12:35 the congregation’s peace and unity.
12:39 But if we’re struggling  to forget the wrong,
12:42 there are two scriptures  that are especially helpful
12:45 in this matter  of settling differences.
12:47 They are Matthew 5:23, 24
12:51 and Matthew 18:15-17.
12:56 Keep in mind that these texts
12:58 are not referring  to the same scenarios,
13:01 nor are they to be applied
13:03 in the exact same way.
13:05 Matthew chapter 5
13:07 has a broader application
13:09 and can be used to bring peace
13:11 in most situations.
13:13 Matthew chapter 18
13:15 has a more limited application
13:18 and applies to specific situations
13:21 that are more serious in nature.
13:25 Now let’s consider the first text,
13:27 Matthew 5:23, 24:
13:30 “If, then,  you are bringing your gift to the altar
13:34 “and there you remember that  your brother has something against you,
13:37 “leave your gift there  in front of the altar, and go away.
13:42 “First make your peace  with your brother,
13:44 and then come back  and offer your gift.”
13:47 To truly capture  what these two brief verses mean
13:51 for you and me today,
13:53 we have to understand  what Jesus’ words meant
13:56 to his first-century Jewish listeners.
13:59 Picture the scene in your mind  as we transport ourselves
14:02 into the city of Jerusalem  some 2,000 years ago.
14:06 It is during one  of the annual festivals.
14:09 There are tens of thousands  of people in the city.
14:13 You are there to make your sacrifice —a beautiful lamb.
14:17 The best one you have.
14:19 It’s clean and unblemished.
14:21 You take the lamb  through a series of courts
14:24 all the way  to the Court of Priests.
14:27 It has taken you  most of the day to get there.
14:30 Now you’re ready  to put your hands on that animal
14:33 and offer a prayer for forgiveness,
14:35 and then you remember something.
14:37 What?
14:39 Verse 23 reads:
14:42 “If, then, you are bringing  your gift to the altar
14:45 “and there you remember  that your brother
14:47 has something against you,”
14:49 Now you think:  ‘My brother
14:52 ‘does have  something against me!
14:54 ‘The last time I saw him,
14:56 ‘he greeted  everybody else but me.
14:58 ‘He was upset.  But what is it?
15:01 ‘I don’t remember  doing anything.
15:03 ‘He is so sensitive!
15:05 He’s always upset  with something.’
15:10 Did Jesus  have all of that in mind
15:12 when he said  what he did in verse 23?
15:14 No!
15:16 He did not go into detail
15:18 about what  that “something” might be.
15:21 He doesn’t say  who is right or wrong.
15:23 He doesn’t make a comment
15:25 about whether someone is too sensitive,
15:28 always getting upset,  never satisfied,
15:31 difficult to get along with.
15:33 Why not?
15:34 Because the reason  behind the “something”
15:37 is not the important thing.
15:40 What is the important thing?
15:42 That the peace  has been disturbed.
15:46 There is a difference  that needs to be settled.
15:49 The lack of peace  between brothers
15:51 could affect their relationship  with Jehovah.
15:54 That is important!
15:56 So what should be done?
15:59 We see the answer in verse 24:
16:02 “Leave your gift there
16:04 “in front of the altar,  and go away.
16:07 “First make your peace  with your brother,
16:10 and then come back  and offer your gift.”
16:13 That animal sacrifice  is important too.
16:15 There’s no doubt about that.
16:17 It represents worship to Jehovah
16:20 —like going to the meetings,  in the field service,
16:23 sharing in family worship.
16:25 But according to Jesus,
16:27 what is more important?
16:29 It is settling the difference
16:33 —making peace  with our brother first.
16:36 Then we will be  in an acceptable position
16:39 to offer our gift  of worship to Jehovah.
16:43 Yes, settling differences  will bring Jehovah’s favor.
16:48 But when can we apply the principle of Matthew 5?
16:52 Whenever there is  a difference to be settled.
16:55 Perhaps our brother  misunderstood what we said or did.
16:59 Or maybe he didn’t misunderstand
17:01 —maybe we did give him  a valid reason to be hurt.
17:04 Regardless, we notice
17:06 that he has something against us.
17:09 In that case, we make peace.
17:12 We can also use  the principles of this text
17:16 when we are hurt or have something
17:18 against our brother.
17:20 We can take the initiative ourselves
17:22 to settle misunderstandings,
17:24 to resolve differences,
17:26 and to make peace  with our brother.
17:28 Again, Jehovah blesses  such a spirit.
17:34 Now, open your Bible  to Matthew chapter 18.
17:38 We mentioned earlier that it has
17:40 a more limited application.
17:42 How so?
17:44 Notice verse 15:
17:46 “Moreover,  if your brother commits a sin,
17:50 “go and reveal his fault  between you and him alone.
17:54 If he listens to you,  you have gained your brother.”
17:58 Here Jesus says,  “if your brother commits a sin.”
18:02 That is much different  than just having
18:04 “something against [us].”
18:06 We are talking about a situation  that is much more serious.
18:10 What situation?
18:12 The revised  Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will book,
18:15 page 136, explains
18:17 that it “involves financial  or property matters,
18:21 “such as failing to repay a loan
18:23 “or committing fraud.
18:25 “Or the offense  might be slander,
18:28 which seriously affects  someone’s reputation.”
18:32 Of course,  they are sins that could be resolved
18:34 between the individuals concerned
18:36 but are also serious enough
18:39 to merit expulsion  from the congregation if not settled.
18:44 Before we start applying  Matthew 18:15,
18:47 we should first consider  whether it is really necessary
18:50 to pursue the matter.
18:52 Could we simply  forgive the individual
18:55 for what was done  or even take the loss
18:57 if it were a financial matter?
19:00 That is a personal decision.
19:03 If we decide to pursue the matter,
19:05 what do we do?
19:07 Jesus helps us in verse 15,  when he says
19:10 that we reveal his fault
19:12 between the two of us alone.
19:15 We do not discuss  the matter with others,
19:18 attempting to get them  to side with us.
19:21 We do not go  straight to the elders
19:23 and try to get them  to solve the problem for us.
19:26 No, we try to resolve the matter between us.
19:30 And since our goal  is to settle the difference,
19:33 maintain our relationship  with Jehovah,
19:36 and help our brother do the same,
19:38 we make repeated efforts  to speak with him
19:41 when our initial efforts  are unsuccessful.
19:44 Keep in mind  that Jesus did not say:
19:47 “Go only once  and reveal his fault.”
19:52 When applying this first step,  make it clear
19:55 that your motive  is to ‘gain your brother.’
19:58 Also, it would be helpful  to clearly state
20:00 that you are applying  the first step in settling differences
20:04 as outlined by Jesus  at Matthew 18:15.
20:07 Of course,  this would be stated in a kindly,
20:11 nonthreatening manner
20:13 but still in a way  to show the seriousness
20:15 of getting the matter settled.
20:19 What if the first step
20:21 in gaining your brother is unsuccessful?
20:25 Notice verse 16 explains step 2:
20:28 “But if he does not listen,
20:30 “take along with you  one or two more,
20:32 “so that on the testimony  of two or three witnesses
20:36 every matter  may be established.”
20:39 Yes, we talk with him  in the company of one or two more.
20:43 Would that be our best friends?
20:45 No.
20:46 The whole purpose  is to ‘gain our brother.’
20:49 Teaming up with two  of our best friends
20:52 could alienate our brother.
20:54 Instead, it makes sense
20:56 that we would choose  other mature Christians.
21:00 How would mature Christians  be helpful?
21:03 Well, are we  misunderstanding things?
21:06 Could they help him  to reason about the matter?
21:09 Could a solution be found?
21:12 Having spiritually mature witnesses there
21:15 may help to resolve the matter.
21:18 Generally, applying steps 1
21:20 and 2 will result  in gaining your brother
21:22 and preserving the peace  of the congregation.
21:27 If he does not respond  to these repeated efforts
21:31 to help him, then what?
21:33 You have a decision to make.
21:37 Are you willing  to forgive your brother,
21:39 even take a loss  if a financial matter is involved?
21:44 If you choose  to pursue the matter further,
21:46 listen to Jesus’ words recorded
21:49 at verse 17:
21:51 “If he does not listen to them,
21:53 “speak to the congregation.
21:56 “If he does not listen  even to the congregation,
21:59 “let him be to you  just as a man of the nations
22:02 and as a tax collector.”
22:05 At this point,  the body of elders
22:07 representing the congregation  will get involved.
22:11 They will review  the facts of the case and determine
22:14 if a judicial committee  should be appointed.
22:17 Happily, though,  these situations are rare,
22:21 and matters  are often resolved peacefully
22:23 before reaching  such a serious point.
22:27 Think back again  to that heartfelt prayer to Jehovah.
22:31 Has Jehovah heard  our sincere requests?
22:35 Will he forgive?
22:37 Well, at this moment,
22:39 if you realize there is a difference  with your brother
22:43 that needs to be settled,
22:45 pray to Jehovah about the matter.
22:47 Ask him to help you see
22:49 beyond the emotion  and make peace.
22:52 Do not let any more time go by!
22:57 Once we have followed  the simple steps outlined by Jesus
23:01 and have forgiven others,
23:03 the condition has been met;
23:05 the price has been paid.
23:07 Then what will Jehovah  do for us?
23:10 Jesus said:
23:12 ‘He will also forgive us.’
23:14 As a result,  we will gain the peace of mind
23:18 that comes with a clean conscience,
23:20 knowing that we have  Jehovah’s favor and blessing.
23:24 We can then  make a valuable contribution
23:27 to the beautiful,  united brotherhood
23:30 that we are privileged  to be a part of.
23:34 There are more lessons  in Matthew chapter 18
23:38 that teach us how to maintain peace  and unity with our brothers.
23:42 Just as important  as settling differences,
23:46 Jesus cautioned against becoming  a cause for stumbling.
23:50 At a Bethel morning worship,
23:53 Brother Stephen Lett described
23:55 three ways  we can avoid stumbling others.
23:59 Now, this word picture
24:01 of someone being stumbled
24:03 is quite vivid, isn’t it?
24:05 We’ve all seen someone stumbled.
24:07 In fact, we’ve all stumbled  ourselves at times,
24:10 and there are varying degrees  of consequences.
24:14 For example,  a person can stumble,
24:17 quickly recover,
24:19 and continue  almost uneventfully down the path.
24:23 Or a person can stumble,
24:26 fall, break a bone,
24:28 eventually they recover
24:30 —but only after extensive therapy.
24:33 Then again, a person can stumble,
24:35 fall, hit his head,  never recover
24:39 —becoming a casualty.
24:42 Well, the situation is similar
24:44 when one is stumbled spiritually.
24:47 He can recover quickly,
24:49 maybe recover over time,
24:52 or he may never recover
24:54 —becoming a spiritual casualty.
24:57 So we cannot know  the ultimate outcome
25:01 for someone who is stumbled.
25:03 So no wonder we’re cautioned  to be very careful
25:05 to never be any cause  for stumbling.
25:09 Open up  to Matthew chapter 18,
25:12 and here’s  an especially powerful scripture
25:15 in this regard.
25:17 Matthew 18:6, Jesus says:
25:19 “But whoever stumbles  one of these little ones
25:23 “who have faith in me,
25:25 “it would be better for him  to have hung around his neck
25:28 “a millstone  that is turned by a donkey
25:32 and to be sunk in the open sea.”
25:36 Well, with graphic language,
25:39 Jesus describes  how that if we cause someone
25:43 to become a spiritual casualty,
25:45 we could actually bring  eternal doom
25:47 upon ourselves.
25:49 But now, here’s a question,
25:51 What could we do  to cause someone to stumble?
25:55 Well, interestingly,  there are several similarities
25:58 between causing someone  to stumble physically
26:01 and causing someone  to stumble spiritually.
26:04 Let us discuss three.
26:06 Now one, pushing someone
26:09 could cause them to stumble,
26:11 especially if they’re on uneven terrain,  if you think about it.
26:16 And this is true  physically and spiritually.
26:20 But think about Jehovah  for a moment.
26:22 He could push any of us,  couldn’t he?
26:24 He could force us to serve him.
26:27 He certainly has the power,  but he never uses it that way.
26:30 Instead, he invites, he encourages;
26:33 and he explains the blessings,
26:35 the curses,  depending upon how we decide.
26:38 But it’s up to us, isn’t it?
26:40 For example, at Isaiah 48:18,
26:43 Jehovah says: ‘If only
26:46 ‘you would pay attention  to my commandments!
26:49 ‘Then your peace  would become like a river
26:53 and your righteousness  like the waves of the sea.’
26:57 Beseeching, but not forcing.
27:01 Now think about it,  if Jehovah doesn’t force,
27:03 he doesn’t want us  to force either, does he?
27:05 For example, parents
27:08 need to be very careful  they don’t just simply push
27:10 their children to serve Jehovah.
27:12 But rather, lovingly,
27:14 beseechingly like Jehovah,
27:17 try to reach the heart,  and of course,
27:19 clearly show them the blessings
27:21 that will come their way  if they do.
27:23 Another example,
27:24 elders should never try  to push Jehovah’s sheep.
27:28 I heard an experience  about an elder, during his part,
27:32 asked the brothers  for a show of hands
27:35 how many were going out in service  the next morning.
27:37 Well, only a few raised their hand.
27:40 He proceeded  to scold the congregation
27:43 that more should be going out.
27:45 Well, he then unwisely asked
27:48 for another show of hands.
27:50 You guessed it —fewer raised their hand
27:53 the second time.
27:55 Take another example,
27:57 those who conduct Bible studies
27:59 should not just try to push  their students to do the right thing.
28:03 “You’ve got to quit smoking!  You’ve got to get rid of those idols!”
28:06 No, not with external pressure,
28:09 but by motivating their hearts,
28:11 you motivate your students.
28:14 Or take another example,  none of us
28:16 should try to push schoolmates,  workmates, or relatives
28:20 to accept the truth.
28:22 A pushing approach,
28:24 shoving approach —even though motivated with sincerity—
28:28 has actually resulted  in people being stumbled
28:30 away from the truth  for many years.
28:33 It makes me think of the story,  or the saying,
28:36 that when a person  first learns the truth,
28:39 you should lock them up  for about six months
28:41 to contain, or minimize,  the damage they do.
28:44 Well, that saying is totally erroneous.
28:46 You shouldn’t lock that brother up;  you should follow that brother.
28:51 See, that brother has zeal,  doesn’t he?
28:53 But it’s true,  we probably do need to help him
28:56 to properly channel that zeal,
28:58 so that he doesn’t try  to force his relatives
29:01 or others to accept the truth
29:04 that he is so excited about.
29:06 But now, what is the second thing
29:09 we can do to cause someone  to stumble?
29:13 Placing an obstacle in their path.
29:17 Now again, this is true  physically or spiritually.
29:21 And if you think about it,
29:23 whether we put  that stumbling block there intentionally
29:27 or unintentionally,  the result is the same, isn’t it?
29:30 As mentioned  in today’s Watchtower comments,
29:33 wholesome speech and upright conduct
29:36 can help us to avoid
29:38 ever being a cause for stumbling.
29:40 In contrast, unwholesome speech,
29:43 unclean conduct,
29:45 can easily stumble ones inside
29:47 or outside the congregation.
29:49 But now, what about in an area
29:51 where we have a Scriptural right  to do something?
29:54 Now, surely exercising that right,
29:57 if it stumbles someone,
29:59 we can’t be held accountable  for that, can we?
30:02 Well, open up  to 1 Corinthians chapter 8,
30:05 and here —very interestingly—
30:08 this scripture  answers that question.
30:10 1 Corinthians 8:9,
30:14 it says:  “But keep watching
30:17 “that your right to choose
30:20 “does not somehow
30:22 become a stumbling block  to those who are weak.”
30:26 Isn’t that interesting?
30:28 Even our right to choose,
30:30 if it would stumble someone,
30:32 we wouldn’t exercise that right  according to this scripture.
30:35 The apostle Paul,  in verse 13 of that same chapter,
30:38 he said he  wouldn’t even eat meat ever again
30:41 if it stumbled his brother.
30:44 Well, like Paul,  are we willing
30:46 to forgo our rights regarding,
30:48 for example,  wearing a beard,
30:50 wearing heavy makeup,
30:53 using alcohol —as just a few examples—
30:57 if exercising that right
30:59 might even possibly stumble someone?
31:02 But now,  what’s the third way
31:04 we could cause someone to stumble?
31:06 Failing to warn him
31:09 about a potential trip hazard.
31:11 We could call this  the sin of omission.
31:14 And again,  it applies physically and spiritually.
31:18 As a physical example,  let’s say we see the floor
31:21 has just been mopped,
31:23 and an unsuspecting person
31:26 is approaching that wet area.
31:28 Now will we warn them?
31:30 If we don’t warn them —they fall, hurt themselves—
31:33 would we not share  some responsibility?
31:37 Well, similarly,
31:39 with spiritual application,
31:41 Galatians 6:1 tells us
31:44 that if someone “takes a false step”  before he’s aware of it,
31:47 what are we supposed  to try to do?
31:50 “Try to readjust” such a person,
31:52 but then it adds:  “In a spirit of mildness.”
31:55 Don’t push him!
31:56 But try to gently, lovingly warn
32:00 and readjust that person.
32:02 So there we have three areas
32:05 in which we must be careful  we never contribute
32:08 toward someone being stumbled.
32:10 We don’t push others  to serve Jehovah.
32:14 We strive to never,
32:16 even unintentionally,
32:19 put a stumbling block in their path —for example—
32:22 by insisting on exercising  our personal rights.
32:25 And number three,  we never fail to lovingly warn
32:29 one whom we see approaching
32:32 a potential trip hazard.
32:35 Rather than being  any cause for stumbling,
32:39 we want to be  a force for good, don’t we?
32:41 Helping others to stand firm
32:44 and even helping ones get up  if they have fallen.
32:48 None of us want to cause  our brother to stumble,
32:51 but it can happen  if we’re not careful.
32:54 Why not recall the three ways
32:56 Brother Lett listed  to avoid stumbling others?
32:59 You can then examine  how you’re doing as a parent,
33:02 an elder, a Bible teacher,
33:05 or as a fellow worshipper  in the congregation.
33:09 The effort we make toward unity  is always worthwhile.
33:13 We want only joyful memories
33:15 of the years spent  working side by side
33:17 with our brothers and sisters.
33:20 That’s the way  Sister Esther Lozano looks back
33:23 on 73 years  of special full-time service.
33:29 Well, everybody here  calls me Honey, but my name
33:32 is Esther Lozano.
33:34 And I was born in Fresno, California,
33:38 in 1919.
33:40 I was baptized in 1935,
33:44 and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed  my service to Jehovah.
33:48 I became a special pioneer,
33:51 and then they called me to Gilead.
33:54 I was in the fourth class of Gilead.
33:58 That was in 1944.
34:01 When I left my assignment as a special,
34:04 I didn’t even know how it was to study,  but this was beautiful
34:09 how Gilead prepared us  for what was in the future.
34:13 Right after Gilead,
34:15 we went to Brooklyn Bethel for two years
34:19 —Esther Lopez and I—
34:21 then I was sent to Mexico.
34:23 I came in 1947,  and I’m still here.
34:28 So that makes more than 68 years  I’ve been in Mexico.
34:33 When I arrived, there were 7 Bethelites,
34:37 and there were 22 missionaries.
34:39 We all lived right at the branch;
34:41 it was a branch-missionary home.
34:43 The progress in Mexico
34:46 really is because of the families  being united.
34:50 And when you get  the husband and wife together,
34:55 then the whole family  comes in the truth.
35:00 In 1961, Sister Esther Lozano  preached to our grandparents.
35:04 My grandfather first got interested
35:06 through the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.
35:09 When I placed the book
35:10 with his wife and she gave it to him,
35:13 he decided that that’s what  he was looking for.
35:17 He said,  “Well, when can I be baptized?”
35:21 Three visits later,
35:23 a study was started with the entire family.
35:26 And the oldest son was only 13.
35:29 He said,  “I’m getting baptized too!”
35:31 About a year ago, he came
35:35 and brought me a letter  and told me how happy he was
35:39 that I had gone to their home
35:42 and preached to them.
35:45 And that was  a happy experience of my life.
35:49 Today, in our family,
35:50 we are 23 Witnesses  spread over four generations,
35:53 and now my brother  and I are serving here
35:56 at the Central America branch.
35:59 Oh, I forgot to talk about my husband.
36:01 He was the branch overseer at that time.
36:04 We were there  in the same branch for five years.
36:08 We got to know each other,  but I didn’t pay attention to him
36:11 because I was always in the service.
36:14 And so, I don’t know when he decided
36:18 he wanted to get married  because I know
36:20 that wasn’t his goal in life.
36:22 And so I wrote Brother Knorr
36:24 and asked him if he was surprised
36:27 to hear that we  were going to be married.
36:29 Then he did write me back
36:31 and also said,  well this is what he said in the letter:
36:35 ‘You’re always jolly  and talkative when I’m around.
36:39 ‘On the other hand,
36:40 ‘Brother Lozano is so quiet.
36:43 ‘I must say, it is an interesting combination.
36:47 ‘Both of you together  can serve him and aid
36:51 one another in your true worship.’
36:53 This is one of my greatest treasures,
36:57 having that letter from Brother Knorr.
37:00 Then when Rudy died,
37:03 I didn’t dwell on that.
37:06 I remembered  I made my dedication to Jehovah,
37:09 and I know that he would want me
37:12 to put that first in my life.
37:14 So I did not really suffer
37:18 that much about his death
37:20 because I became even more involved
37:23 in theocratic activities.
37:29 I’m in the Correspondence.
37:31 But I’m at work  about an hour and a half in the morning
37:36 and an hour and a half  in the afternoon
37:39 and the rest of the time
37:41 I’m studying here in the room.
37:44 I’m so pleased that I’m still able
37:46 to go to the morning text,
37:49 and I have a part in the service.
37:52 I have two studies  that I conduct every week.
38:00 It’s such a pleasure to be with people
38:03 that have dedicated their lives to Jehovah.
38:08 And that’s what makes me happy  because I know
38:10 Jehovah counts them
38:12 as his precious sons and daughters.
38:18 I don’t know why,
38:20 but many of the missionaries
38:22 have come up to me and told me
38:24 that I’ve been  an encouragement to them,
38:26 and really,  they are the ones that encourage me.
38:29 It’s because I had  such beautiful examples
38:33 to follow in all these years.
38:37 And all I can say  is thanks to Jehovah
38:41 for this great privilege  of serving him.
38:52 Sister Lozano is a beautiful example
38:55 of sticking to your assignment  and building
38:57 close bonds of friendship.
38:59 Did you notice  another blessing she enjoyed?
39:03 It was finding a marriage mate
39:05 who shared her goals  for full-time service.
39:08 Of course,  not every courtship leads to marriage.
39:12 If you’re dating,  can you look past your emotions
39:16 to honestly see the differences
39:18 and flaws  in your potential mate?
39:21 Can you accept these?
39:23 Or are they serious enough
39:25 for you to end your courtship?
39:27 That’s the situation  depicted in the third
39:30 and final part of the series
39:32 Preparing for Marriage.
39:37 Well, the big day finally arrived.
39:41 After all those months of preparation,
39:43 it was just as I imagined.
39:46 Oh wait!
39:48 That’s not me.
39:50 That’s me.
39:58 As I watched my sister  get married that day,
40:08 I couldn’t help  but think about my own future.
40:20 When I began dating Shane,
40:24 everything was perfect.
40:49 We spent a lot of time  talking on the phone.
41:05 Everything just naturally  seemed to click.
41:25 I was convinced he was the one.
41:42 But over time,  I started to notice some things.
41:59 I was starting to see patterns.
42:24 And they didn’t seem  to be getting better.
42:56 I wasn’t even sure  our goals were the same anymore.
43:12 I felt alone.
43:21 But thankfully, I wasn’t.
43:31 My mom kindly asked  how things were going,
43:34 so I told her.
43:37 “Maybe he’s not the one,”  I told her.
43:41 I thought she was going to tell me
43:43 which way I should go,  but she didn’t.
43:47 Instead, she reassured me
43:49 that if he wasn’t the one,  I was going to be OK.
44:17 They reminded me about what Jesus said  when building a tower.
44:23 “For example, who of you  wanting to build a tower
44:26 “does not first sit down  and calculate the expense
44:30 to see if he has enough  to complete it?”
44:33 I realized that I was about to enter  into a building project of my own
44:38 —my relationship with Shane—
44:40 and I too needed  to “calculate the expense”
44:43 before I commit to it.
44:45 They encouraged me  to talk to Shane
44:48 and tell him about the things  that were concerning me.
44:56 So I did.
45:04 And my mom was right.
45:07 I was OK, more than OK, really.
45:10 Shane and I decided it was best  to break off the relationship.
45:19 And some years later,
45:21 I found someone  that loves Jehovah as much as I do,
45:27 and I love him with my whole heart.
45:35 Our sister wisely compared
45:37 her relationship  to a building project.
45:40 She “calculated the expense”
45:42 of any traits she saw  during their courtship
45:44 —well before they  could become problems in a marriage.
45:48 Of course,  we shouldn’t expect
45:50 perfection from our mate,
45:52 but working through matters  during courtship
45:55 is another opportunity  that Jehovah provides
45:58 to settle differences in peace.
46:01 There’s something common  to every successful marriage
46:04 between two Christians.
46:06 It is their putting Jehovah first
46:08 and supporting  each other’s personal dedication to God.
46:12 This is certainly true  with Viv and Ann Mouritz,
46:16 serving  in the Australasia branch.
46:19 They’ve been married for 65 years
46:22 and have  a combined 131 years
46:25 in full-time service.
46:27 Listen to their advice  for younger ones
46:30 deciding what to do  in Jehovah’s organization.
46:35 I started pioneering  in November 1948.
46:38 That’s a while ago now.
46:40 And that’s what I thought  I would do—pioneer.
46:47 So I said, “Well, Jehovah,  if I do what you ask me,
46:52 “I accept whatever assignment  you give me,
46:54 “and I’ll just go  where you send me,
46:56 and I won’t seek an assignment,  but I won’t refuse one.”
46:59 That’s all I intended to do  as far as I knew,
47:02 but then I had only been pioneering  about a year
47:04 when I got this envelope,  and the letter said:
47:06 “Please fill in the enclosed form.”
47:08 It was an application for Bethel,  and I thought,
47:11 ‘Goodness, I didn’t think of Bethel.
47:13 I told Jehovah I’d go where he sent me,  so don’t argue, just do it.’
47:18 I was working in the printery  cleaning out old ink tins
47:22 and making schedules  for printing and so on.
47:25 And then I got to work  on the press too,
47:28 but I wasn’t there very long  when they moved me to the office.
47:34 Well, you learn a lot in Bethel.
47:36 You learn how to live  with your brothers,
47:38 which you’re not used to.
47:40 You learn about Jehovah’s organization —you see how it operates.
47:45 I had the privilege of working alongside  brothers who had lots of experience.
47:51 I got assigned  to Metropolitan Congregation.
47:54 That’s where Ann was.
47:56 Yeah, we got married  in October 1951,
47:59 and two weeks later,
48:01 I started pioneering.
48:05 I was 20 at that time  when we started circuit work,
48:09 and I’d only pioneered for a year;
48:12 so of course I was very worried
48:15 and scared about having to witness  with sisters
48:18 that had pioneered for years  and some of them even of the anointed.
48:23 I cried halfway to Melbourne.
48:27 We got very close  to the brothers and sisters
48:30 and especially to the children,  so we really loved that.
48:33 And then we  got the opportunity to go
48:36 to New York  to the international convention
48:39 in 1958.
48:42 When the Society found out  we were going, they sent us
48:45 an application for Gilead,  and we thought, ‘Oh, my goodness.
48:48 How can we do that?’
48:51 So we said,  “Well, we don’t say no.”
48:56 After the ‘58 convention,
48:58 we were assigned to special pioneer
49:01 in Canada for six months.
49:03 Brother Knorr said  we were in cold storage,
49:05 so there were about 40 of us
49:07 from British Commonwealth countries.
49:09 So that was a good experience too.
49:12 We saw winter for the first time.  I did, anyway.
49:16 And we took pictures  of snow and ice and icicles
49:19 to show in our assignment when we  got into India or Africa or somewhere.
49:24 And Jehovah had a sense of humor;  he sent us to Finland.
49:29 Well, the schooling you get from Gilead
49:31 or the other schools
49:33 helps you to see Jehovah’s organization
49:36 and how it works.
49:40 We didn’t know a lot about Finland  except that we knew it was cold
49:43 and clean
49:49 and a long way from Australia.
49:51 Being so far from Australia,
49:56 we knew that we  wouldn’t be able to get home
49:58 to see our families,  not for a long, long time.
50:04 When we moved into Finland,  the brothers
50:07 in Russia and those countries  were under ban.
50:10 They needed spiritual food,
50:12 and so it had to be supplied to them.
50:16 So we used to send people in as tourists,  and they would meet
50:19 the brothers there  and deliver the food to them.
50:24 Without Jehovah’s blessing  and his spirit,
50:26 we couldn’t have done it at all.
50:29 It’s amazing to think  that the amount of spiritual food
50:32 that got in there,  they translated it,
50:35 and they made it available.
50:38 And we did that for over 20 years
50:40 without any mishaps.
50:42 It couldn’t happen  without Jehovah’s blessing.
50:45 Leaving Finland was not easy,  of course.
50:47 We had mixed feelings,
50:49 but, actually,  I saw Jehovah’s hand
50:52 in the assignment
50:54 because we really got back  to Australia
50:57 at a time when my parents  were needing help,
50:59 so we didn’t have to leave Bethel
51:02 or full-time service  to give that help.
51:05 We were asked  to go to Russia in 1999.
51:08 That turned out  to be two and a half years.
51:11 I was a little apprehensive  about going to Russia,
51:14 but it was really one of the most  memorable assignments
51:17 we’ve ever had.
51:20 In Russia, the brothers  were not used to house-to-house work
51:23 because of all the years under ban.
51:27 And that was quite different  because you go to the door;
51:30 you can’t just strike up a conversation.
51:32 The person wants to know  why you are there.
51:34 And you can’t make
51:35 a return visit on someone  you met on the street
51:37 —well, you don’t know  where he lives.
51:39 If you’ve called at his house, you do,  and you can make a return visit.
51:42 The brothers saw  the advantage of that.
51:45 But they had to learn.  It was a new thing.
51:48 Circuit overseers had to learn  how to visit congregations,
51:51 and Polish brothers came in  and helped a lot with that
51:55 —did circuit work— but they too had to learn.
51:59 So it was a big change for them
52:01 to come from working  under ban all their lives
52:04 to now working the way  the rest of the world does.
52:10 The best decision I ever made
52:12 was to put my life  in Jehovah’s hands,
52:14 and to say, “You decide
52:16 where I go and what I do.”
52:20 I’ve had the feeling all along,  and it’s proven true so far,
52:23 that everything I have done
52:25 has been training for something else.
52:28 So, what I’m doing now  is still training.
52:30 It must be for the new world because I haven’t got
52:32 much time left in this one.
52:34 What will it be?  Well, who knows?
52:41 So my recommendation  to everyone is:
52:43 Don’t decide for yourself.
52:45 Let Jehovah do it.
52:50 Brother and Sister Mouritz  always looked to Jehovah
52:52 for their assignments.
52:54 For Brother Mouritz,  that’s meant serving
52:57 on the Branch Committees  in Finland, India,
53:00 Russia, Poland, Ukraine,
53:02 and Australasia
53:04 and the privilege of making visits
53:06 to more than 70 countries
53:08 as a representative  of world headquarters.
53:12 We can certainly pursue  any form of service
53:15 that our circumstances allow.
53:17 But when we pray  for Jehovah’s direction,
53:20 we rely on him to send us
53:22 where it benefits his organization
53:24 and ourselves the most.
53:27 The willing spirit  to do Jehovah’s will
53:29 is shared by Bethelites  who have received
53:32 new assignments in the field.
53:34 Adjustments in the work at Bethel
53:36 have put greater emphasis  on the preaching work.
53:40 More resources,
53:42 including experienced Bible teachers,
53:44 are being directed  to the busy harvest.
53:48 In this report  from the South Africa branch,
53:51 we hear from loyal ones
53:53 who are supporting theocratic direction.
53:56 On September 23, 2015,  it was announced
54:00 at all branches that  the Governing Body was requesting
54:04 all Bethel families to reduce in size.
54:08 For me personally,
54:10 when they made that announcement
54:11 on Wednesday, September 23,
54:13 that was exciting.
54:14 It was—
54:15 I knew it was momentous.
54:17 When the announcement was made,
54:19 tears welled up in my eyes
54:20 because I realized how close we are
54:22 to the end.
54:23 And I remember just closing my eyes
54:24 and saying to Jehovah,
54:25 “Whatever you want, we’ll do.”
54:27 When I received news of my reassignment,
54:30 initially I was numb.
54:32 When I got the news
54:33 about my reassignment,
54:35 I was so scared in the beginning.
54:38 It caught me off guard.
54:40 I wasn’t expecting it.
54:42 We were quite shocked and sad,
54:45 but we were encouraged by the brothers
54:49 at Bethel and also in the congregation.
54:52 The direction from the Governing Body
54:54 was that we were being reassigned
54:56 as regular pioneers.
54:57 We signed the forms for pioneering  that very Thursday.
55:02 For me, I’ve always appreciated  the scripture at 1 Samuel 12:22
55:07 where it states there:  “For the sake of his great name,
55:09 Jehovah will not abandon his people.”
55:11 I don’t want to forget my Bethel time,
55:14 because it was lovely,
55:15 but I want to stretch forward ahead
55:17 to pioneering and really enjoy it.
55:18 We prayed specifically for a place
55:21 that is going to help us  to be as simple
55:24 as possible so that we can focus  our attention to the ministry.
55:28 All that I’d love to say  to everyone who has been reassigned
55:32 is that Jehovah is our Father,
55:34 and he will never relinquish  his responsibility as a Father.
55:37 He will take care of us.
55:40 We are losing four couples
55:42 from our congregation.
55:43 And I would like to tell
55:45 the congregations  where they have been assigned to
55:48 that they are getting  real spiritual people
55:51 and that they are  really going to be an asset
55:53 to their congregation.
55:56 I just want to also thank
55:58 the brothers in the congregation  where we are going to
56:00 because they organized  secular work for us
56:03 and also, as Bonnie mentioned,  accommodation.
56:06 So they made it easier for us
56:08 to look forward to our assignment.
56:11 But we know this,  of course, comes from Jehovah.
56:14 And so the Branch Committee said,
56:16 “Well, we have to move quickly with this.”
56:18 We asked the family,
56:19 “Please, give us two,  three weeks to work things out,”
56:22 and that is what they appreciated.
56:24 Congregations phoned in.
56:26 The Bethelites were offered jobs.
56:29 They were offered accommodation.
56:31 Our congregation is delighted
56:33 having two young Bethelites
56:36 coming and joining us.
56:37 Our congregation  has quite a number of young people.
56:40 We can already see that
56:41 it’s going to benefit them quite a lot.
56:44 We’ve actually assisted them
56:46 in getting a place  where they could stay,
56:48 and also we’ve assisted them  to settle in
56:50 and be part of the congregation.
56:52 Welcome to our new home!
56:54 We’ve been here a little over a week now.
56:56 The brothers helped  to paint the house,
56:58 to put tiles on,  to clean the entire place.
57:02 So they really did  a lot of work in our behalf.
57:04 Also, memories  of our friends from Bethel.
57:07 It was about six months ago
57:09 when we enjoyed pioneer school.
57:10 Thanks to our brothers,  we were able to find employment.
57:14 Jehovah has been  answering our prayers,
57:16 and sometimes  he has been answering
57:18 our concerns  even before we even pray about it.
57:21 No doubt,
57:23 these extraordinary experiences  in South Africa
57:26 are mirrored all over the world.
57:29 The love we show  to each other is a reflection
57:32 of Jehovah’s great love  for each of us,
57:36 and we thank him to be a part
57:39 of this amazing brotherhood.
57:46 The Governing Body  deeply appreciates
57:48 the brotherhood’s loyal response  to theocratic direction.
57:52 Change is not always easy,
57:54 but it helps when we look  at Jehovah’s blessing
57:57 on new spiritual provisions
57:59 and adjustments to the work.
58:01 Letters of appreciation  from our brothers
58:04 add to the Governing Body’s confidence
58:06 that Jehovah  is directing his organization.
58:10 A sister from the United States  wrote this about JW Broadcasting,
58:15 “Often the programming seems like
58:17 a direct answer to a prayer.”
58:20 After a particularly difficult day,  she added:
58:24 “What did I find today at home  for me like a present from Jehovah?
58:29 The March [2016] broadcast  . . . dealing with discouragement.”
58:35 After watching  the January 2016 broadcast,
58:39 a family from Austria wrote:
58:42 ‘Our eldest son is serving  in the branch in Selters, Germany.
58:46 ‘We are very proud of him,  but we terribly miss him.
58:50 ‘So we love the new song,  “I Give You My Best.”
58:54 ‘It’s heartwarming  that you know our feelings
58:57 and value our offers.’
59:00 Jehovah is certainly giving us
59:02 what we need  when we need it.
59:05 And it comes to us  in such variety.
59:08 This next music video,  for example,
59:11 fits well with our discussion  on settling differences.
59:15 It begins with a situation  between a young mother
59:18 and her mother-in-law  and reminds us
59:21 to “Forgive One Another.”
59:38 Yes, you had the best of intentions. Kindnesses too numerous to mention.
59:50 But thoughtless words  just cut me to the heart.
59:55 Then, as a tear appears, I see. Things aren’t what they seem to be.
1:00:05 Before the sun slips from the sky, Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.
1:00:17 We’ll forget the things we said, And, please, let’s forgive.
1:00:25 Sisters today, sisters we’ll stay.
1:00:31 Getting along is not always easy. Angry words can bring you down, believe me.
1:00:44 Then you find a reason to forgive, And now you realize it’s true;
1:00:53 Letting go’s the thing to do.
1:00:59 Before the sun slips from the sky, Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.
1:01:11 We’ll forget the things we said, And, please, let’s forgive.
1:01:18 Brothers today, brothers we’ll stay.
1:01:25 Not one thing said or done can break us up.  Love’s a bond of unity.
1:01:37 Cancel the debt; forgive and forget. That’s the way true friendship should be.
1:01:48 Before the sun slips from the sky, Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.
1:02:01 We’ll forget the things we said, And, please, let’s forgive.
1:02:08 Here in our hearts, that’s where it starts.
1:02:22 Bonded in love, forgiving one another.
1:02:36 Did you see two critical areas
1:02:39 where we need to be forgiving?
1:02:41 It was in the family  and in the congregation.
1:02:44 We’ll always have reasons
1:02:46 in this imperfect world  to forgive.
1:02:49 Look for the opportunities  in your life
1:02:51 to imitate Jehovah  and forgive others.
1:02:54 As we conclude our program,
1:02:56 we take you on a visit  to world headquarters
1:02:59 in Warwick, New York.
1:03:01 The Bethel family  has been moving
1:03:03 into their new work areas.
1:03:06 More than 25,000 brothers  and sisters
1:03:09 worked on the construction  of the facility.
1:03:12 It was a united effort  by temporary volunteers,
1:03:16 construction servants,  Bethelites, construction groups,
1:03:20 and volunteers  who previously worked
1:03:22 on Kingdom Hall projects.
1:03:24 Earlier this year,  workers were making
1:03:27 final preparations for the arrival
1:03:29 of world headquarters staff.
1:03:32 When open for tours,  visitors will enjoy
1:03:35 the historic Bible display,
1:03:37 a visual history exhibit  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
1:03:40 and an interactive museum
1:03:43 explaining how Jehovah directs  his organization today.
1:03:47 We thank Jehovah for all
1:03:49 who helped to complete  the new world headquarters.
1:03:52 That includes  the thousands of volunteers
1:03:55 but also the millions  of you dear brothers and sisters
1:03:58 who support the worldwide work
1:04:01 with your regular donations.
1:04:03 We send you our love  and pray for Jehovah
1:04:06 to bless  our united brotherhood.
1:04:08 From Brooklyn, New York,
1:04:10 this is JW Broadcasting!

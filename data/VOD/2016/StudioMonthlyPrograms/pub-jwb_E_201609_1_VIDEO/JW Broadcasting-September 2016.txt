00:01 Greetings!  We’re so happy you could join us.
00:05 It’s a new service year  and a new monthly program.
00:09 And look, we have a new cohost,
00:11 Brother Seth Hyatt,  affectionately known as Rocky.
00:14 Now, Rocky, what can the friends  have to look forward to?
00:17 You can look forward  to this dramatization
00:20 where we meet a sister who is
00:22 on the brink of losing  her joy in the ministry.
00:25 What does she need to do?
00:27 We will all benefit  from the very practical application.
00:31 And we’re also going to see  an amazing video
00:34 from the Art Department  at world headquarters.
00:36 What do they do?  And how do we benefit from their work?
00:39 This segment is going  to answer those questions.
00:42 In some countries in Europe,  congregations are involved
00:45 in witnessing at truck stops.
00:47 This has proved to be a very productive way of reaching individuals
00:51 who spend most of their time  away from home.
00:55 So if you’re a first-time viewer, welcome.
00:58 If you’re a regular viewer, welcome back.
01:00 This is the September program  of JW Broadcasting!
01:23 Have you enjoyed studying the book
01:25 Imitate Their Faith as much as I have?
01:28 It’s a wonderful book,  isn’t it?
01:31 And I was particularly captivated  by the introduction.
01:35 There was a point in the introduction
01:37 that encouraged us  to use our imagination
01:40 when we’re reading the Bible:
01:42 to see the sights,  to hear the sounds,
01:44 to smell the aromas,  to try to capture the feelings
01:48 of the individuals  that we are reading about.
01:52 Now, of course, we don’t want  our imagination to run away with us,
01:55 but at the same time,  we do want to get
01:57 a solid mental picture  of what we’re reading.
02:01 And that’s what I’d like  to talk to you about today.
02:04 When you’re reading the Bible,  try to get the whole picture.
02:09 Now we’ll use a couple  of well-known Bible accounts to illustrate.
02:15 Have you been raised  in a stepfamily or a blended family?
02:20 If you have,  did you know that you have
02:23 something in common with Joseph,  the son of Jacob?
02:26 Joseph was raised  with ten half brothers
02:30 in a large blended family.
02:34 So now you want to try to view
02:38 this family as a composite.
02:40 You want to try to figure out  how did people mesh
02:43 or how did they clash  within this family.
02:46 What would you do?
02:48 Well, you might start by writing down  some of the characteristics
02:51 of the individual members  of the family.
02:54 What about Joseph’s half brothers  and Joseph himself?
02:57 What do you know about them?
02:59 What about Judah,  Simeon, Levi,
03:03 Dan, Naphtali —what do you know?
03:06 So write down  their characteristics,
03:08 and try to figure out  how they might get along.
03:11 Sometimes there is  one individual incident
03:15 that’s recorded in the Bible,
03:17 but we mustn’t forget:
03:20 People’s actions  have a way of affecting other people.
03:24 So when you read  about a certain incident in the Bible,
03:27 try to imagine who  might have been affected by that incident.
03:31 Take an example.
03:33 In the book of Genesis,  we read that Jacob’s son Reuben
03:38 committed sexual immorality  with Bilhah.
03:43 Well, that had an effect  on other people without doubt.
03:46 Who was Reuben?
03:48 He was Leah’s oldest son.
03:51 Who was Bilhah?
03:53 Rachel’s handmaiden.
03:55 Do you think that there might have been  a little animosity or tension
03:59 between Leah and Rachel sometimes,
04:02 especially when you consider  how their marriages started out?
04:07 There may have been.
04:08 And it may be  that the attitudes of the women
04:12 had some bearing on the attitudes of their sons as well.
04:15 So you take all of these things  into consideration.
04:19 Now, Bilhah had two sons,  Dan and Naphtali.
04:23 How do you think  they felt when they learned
04:25 that their oldest brother,  or half brother,
04:28 had committed fornication  with their mother?
04:31 So there could have been  tension there.
04:34 And this all goes into the mix
04:36 when we’re considering  the family as a composite.
04:40 Now, do you picture  Joseph at age 17
04:44 with ten much older half brothers,  maybe in their 30’s,
04:49 some old enough to be his father?
04:52 Not true.
04:54 The truth is that there was only  a seven-year age difference
04:58 between Joseph’s oldest brother,  Reuben, and Joseph himself.
05:03 In fact, 11 of Jacob’s sons
05:06 were born  during the seven-year period
05:08 when Jacob  was working for Laban.
05:12 Eleven sons in seven years,
05:15 how is that possible?
05:17 It’s easy, when you remember  that Jacob had two wives
05:21 and two concubines,  or secondary wives.
05:25 So there didn’t have to be  a nine-month interval
05:27 between the birth  of the children.
05:30 In fact, some could have been born  just about at the same time;
05:33 they could have been  the same age.
05:36 So when Joseph  was sold into slavery at age 17,
05:40 his oldest brother  was no more than 24.
05:44 Some of his brothers were only  a year or two older than Joseph himself.
05:49 So we’re talking  about a group of young men
05:52 in their late teens  and early 20’s,
05:54 and this might explain  some of the hotheaded reactions
05:58 that some  of those young men had.
06:02 Well, so much for the boys.
06:04 What about their father, Jacob?
06:06 What can we learn about him?
06:08 A lot.
06:10 For one thing,  he was a spiritual man.
06:13 Now, this is something  for you young brothers and sisters
06:15 who are contemplating  marriage to think about.
06:18 Jacob was willing  to go to any length
06:21 to keep his relationship  with Jehovah intact.
06:25 Let’s take an example:
06:27 Genesis 29:18.
06:31 You can follow along  on the screen as I read this.
06:34 And we’re talking  about marriage here.
06:38 Genesis 29:18.
06:40 It says:  “Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel,
06:44 “so he said:  ‘I am willing to serve you seven years
06:49 for your younger daughter Rachel.’”
06:52 Now what’s the takeaway?
06:54 Jacob didn’t marry  the first person who came along,
06:58 maybe some pagan woman.
07:00 He didn’t say,  ‘Well, seven years is too long to wait.
07:03 I’m going to find some Philistine woman,  and I’ll marry her.’
07:06 He was willing to wait  so that he could marry someone
07:09 who would join him  in the worship of Jehovah.
07:13 And you young folks,  if you are willing to wait,
07:16 you can be sure that you will have  Jehovah’s blessing as well.
07:20 Now Jacob was apparently also  a bit of a romantic.
07:24 Notice verse 20.
07:26 It says:  “And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,”
07:30 but notice this,
07:32 “but in his eyes  they were like just a few days
07:35 because of his love for her.”
07:38 Now, isn’t that poetic?
07:41 Jacob may have learned  to treasure his wife
07:44 by observing his parents,  Isaac and Rebekah.
07:47 It appears that they  had a strong marriage.
07:50 Just notice what we read
07:52 at Genesis 26:8,
07:57 Genesis 26:8.
08:02 It says:  “After some time had passed,
08:05 “Abimelech king of the Philistines  was looking out of the window,
08:09 and he saw Isaac,”  that’s Jacob’s father,
08:12 “displaying affection  for Rebekah his wife.”
08:17 So it appears  that Isaac and Rebekah
08:21 had a warm relationship,  a good marriage.
08:26 Now, what else  can we learn about Jacob?
08:29 There’s an interesting detail recorded
08:31 in chapter 25 and verse 27.
08:35 It says:  “As the boys got bigger, Esau,”
08:39 Jacob’s brother,
08:41 “became a skilled hunter,  a man of the field,
08:44 “but Jacob was a blameless man,
08:47 dwelling in tents.”
08:50 So Jacob liked to dwell in tents.
08:54 That might explain  the strong bond that developed
08:58 between Jacob and Joseph,  who was his youngest for many years.
09:04 Now although Jacob  liked to dwell in tents,
09:07 he was by no means a sissy.
09:09 He was a strong man,  but he was a spiritual man.
09:14 That’s something  for you young brothers to take away.
09:18 You want to be strong,  we know you do,
09:20 but spirituality  should come first.
09:25 One time, spiritual Jacob  gave his sons a beautiful lesson
09:30 on how to settle  a difference with a family member.
09:33 We read about it  at Genesis chapter 32.
09:37 And I think all of us can learn  from his example.
09:41 We learn at Genesis 32
09:43 that Jacob’s brother, Esau,  was coming to see him.
09:47 Now, they hadn’t seen  each other for 20 years,
09:50 and to say that their parting  had been difficult is an understatement.
09:55 The fact is that when they separated  more than 20 years earlier,
09:59 Esau had vowed that one day  he was going to kill his brother;
10:04 now he was coming to see him.
10:06 Now, why was he  so angry with Jacob?
10:10 It’s because Jacob had received  a blessing from their father,
10:15 and Esau was not happy.
10:18 So Esau arrives,
10:20 and 400 men are with him.
10:23 Why 400 men?
10:25 Well, the Bible doesn’t say.
10:27 But it could be  that he was trying to show
10:29 how important and prominent  he had become.
10:34 How did Jacob react?
10:36 Did he try to go tit for tat?
10:39 Did he try to show how important  and prominent he had become
10:43 with all of the blessings  he’d received?
10:45 Did he reopen old wounds?
10:49 Did he argue with his brother?
10:52 Did he say,  ‘You know I was right all along,
10:55 and you, Esau,  you have been wrong’?
10:57 Did he demand an apology?
11:00 No.
11:02 There was a lot that Jacob  could have bragged about.
11:05 No question about that.
11:07 There was no doubt that Jacob  had Jehovah’s blessing.
11:09 Early on,  we read that an angel of Jehovah
11:13 had appeared to him  and said:
11:15 “I am Jehovah
11:17 “the God of Abraham your father  and the God of Isaac.
11:21 “The land on which you are lying,
11:23 “to you I am going to give it  and to your offspring.
11:27 “I am with you,
11:29 “and I will safeguard you  wherever you go . . .
11:32 I will not leave you.”
11:36 Well, that’s quite a blessing,  isn’t it?
11:38 But there’s more.
11:40 For a portion  of the previous night
11:42 —that is, the night before Esau  and Jacob met up—
11:46 Jacob had wrestled with an angel,
11:49 and as a result,
11:50 he had managed  to receive another blessing.
11:55 But Jacob didn’t flaunt  his blessings.
11:58 Instead, he humbled himself.
12:01 In fact, he even bowed down  seven times before his brother
12:05 in front of his wives  and his 11 sons.
12:11 So Jacob settled  any lingering difference with Esau
12:14 not with his fists,
12:16 not with a bragging tongue,  not with a weapon,
12:20 but humbly,  like a real man
12:23 —like a real, spiritual man.
12:28 In contrast,  how did Jacob’s ten sons
12:32 settle their difference  with Joseph?
12:35 Like a bunch of cowards.
12:37 It was 10 to 1  against Joseph.
12:40 First, they decided  to kill their brother,
12:44 and then they delivered him  up into slavery.
12:47 Those jealous young men  didn’t learn a thing
12:51 from their father’s  excellent spiritual example.
12:54 Well, if you’re on the outs  with a member of your family,
12:58 if you had  a serious difficulty with someone,
13:02 could you try to settle the matter  peacefully as Jacob did?
13:07 If the person tries to apologize,  be gracious about it.
13:11 Don’t make it difficult  for him to apologize.
13:13 Don’t dredge up
13:15 all of the unnecessary details  about the past.
13:18 You may be in the right,  as Jacob was,
13:21 but isn’t the important thing  to make peace?
13:25 Jehovah loves the peacemakers.
13:29 Well, what else  do we learn about Jacob?
13:32 We learn that he wasn’t  his father’s favorite.
13:35 Let’s look  at Genesis chapter 25,
13:41 verse 28.
13:43 “And Isaac loved Esau
13:48 “because it meant game in his mouth,
13:51 whereas Rebekah loved Jacob.”
13:55 Now, this story may resonate  with many of you out there,
13:59 especially if you’ve grown up  in a large family
14:02 or perhaps you’ve had  a number of brothers and sisters.
14:05 Now, we know  your parents claim
14:07 that they always treated  all of you the same,
14:09 that they never ever  had a preference.
14:12 But ask the kids,
14:14 Was there anyone in the family  who was the favorite?
14:17 They all know.  ‘She was!’
14:19 They know this.
14:20 The parents don’t realize it,  but they are giving preferential treatment.
14:25 And so this happens,  and it can be disconcerting at times.
14:29 Imagine this scenario:
14:31 Imagine that you have a couple  who have two children, two sons.
14:35 One is a pioneer.
14:37 He has never given his parents  a moment’s grief.
14:40 The other  never accepted the truth,
14:44 but he has done well  in business,
14:46 and as a result,  he has been generous to his parents,
14:51 and the parents are grateful,  very grateful.
14:55 And the pioneer  often hears the parents bragging
14:58 about the successes  that his brother has had in business.
15:03 Well, the pioneer can’t help  the parents materially very much,
15:06 and so he feels that there’s  a bit of partiality there.
15:10 Is it hurtful?
15:12 Yes.  That is life.
15:14 It’s chemistry.  It’s just chemistry.
15:17 But the pioneer needs to realize
15:20 that Jehovah God  appreciates his work.
15:22 His heavenly Father  loves him very much
15:25 for the work  that he is doing for His name.
15:28 Now, Jacob must have known
15:31 that Isaac loved his brother  more than he loved him.
15:34 And perhaps he vowed  that when he had children,
15:37 he would treat them all the same.
15:39 Well, if he did,  he didn’t keep that promise, did he?
15:43 Everyone knew  that Joseph was the favorite.
15:48 Well, have you noticed what we had to do  to make a composite of this family?
15:53 We had to read  from several different chapters of the Bible
15:56 —Genesis 25, 26, 28, 29, 32.
16:03 You can’t always get  a complete picture of an incident
16:06 by reading just one chapter,  just by reading the chapter you are reading.
16:09 Sometimes you have to extract details  from other chapters of the Bible.
16:16 Now let’s consider  one more example
16:18 where getting the complete picture  can enrich our understanding.
16:22 This is going to be  a shorter one.
16:24 We’re going to consider   the story of Naaman.
16:27 Now, you remember the story.
16:29 At 2 Kings 5:1,
16:32 we learn that Naaman  was the chief of the army
16:36 of Ben-hadad II,  the king of Syria.
16:40 But he was a leper.
16:42 Now Ben-hadad learned  that there was a prophet in Israel
16:45 Elisha who could heal him  of his leprosy.
16:49 And so he told Naaman  that he should go to Israel
16:52 and go to the prophet  and get healed.
16:55 And so word was sent  to the king of Israel by letter,
16:59 and the king of Israel was asked  to send Naaman to Elisha.
17:04 Now, when you think of it,  this was a strange request
17:07 because Israel and Syria  were often at odds.
17:11 Sometimes there were  wars between them,
17:13 and now, here you have  the king of Syria sending his general,
17:17 the one who is going to head  the army against Israel,
17:20 and saying: ‘Well, I’d like my general  to be a more effective general.
17:23 Could you please make sure  that he gets healed?’
17:25 Well, somehow,  he’s sent to Elisha
17:28 and Elisha kindly heals Naaman
17:32 and Naaman becomes  a worshipper of Jehovah.
17:36 Well, we can imagine,
17:38 remember we’re talking  about using our imagination,
17:40 we can imagine  that when Naaman returned to Syria,
17:44 Ben-hadad had lots of nice things  to say about Elisha.
17:49 So then, everyone lived  happily ever after, right?
17:53 If we didn’t read on,  we might think so.
17:57 But that’s not  the end of the story.
17:59 In the next chapter,  chapter 6,
18:03 we learn that Ben-hadad  declared war against Israel.
18:08 Now, if Naaman  was still the chief of the army,
18:11 he’d be in an awkward position.
18:14 Was he going  to lead the armies of Syria
18:16 against fellow worshippers  of Jehovah?
18:19 But it gets worse.
18:21 Ben-hadad learns that Elisha
18:25 is revealing the Syrians’ war strategies  to the king of Israel,
18:30 so he sends a large army  to capture Elisha
18:33 —the very man who  had healed his general.
18:37 So much for gratitude.
18:40 Now, it’s interesting  that Naaman is not mentioned
18:43 as being at the head  of those armies.
18:46 Did he get out of it somehow?
18:48 Don’t ask me.
18:50 If he’s resurrected,  you’ll have to ask him.
18:54 What lesson can we learn?
18:56 That the gratitude of the world  is fleeting.
19:00 Some of us may get excited  if there’s a favorable article
19:03 about Jehovah’s Witnesses  in a newspaper
19:06 or if some TV personality  makes a kind statement about us.
19:10 But what did Jehovah God say?
19:12 Genesis 3:15:
19:14 “I will put enmity  between you and the woman.”
19:18 So Jehovah’s organization  and Satan’s organization
19:21 are always going to be at odds.
19:25 Bible reading isn’t a chore.
19:27 It’s a joy.
19:29 Get the whole picture  of what you’re reading,
19:32 and you’ll enjoy it even more.
19:34 We wish you all  Jehovah’s rich blessing
19:37 as you continue  to enhance your appreciation
19:41 for this sacred volume.
19:43 And now, let’s turn to Rocky.
19:46 I think Rocky  has some practical application to share.
19:49 Thank you, and as David mentioned,
19:52 there is a close connection between joy
19:56 and how we handle our Bible reading.
19:58 In this dramatization,  we meet a pioneer sister
20:01 who did everything just right
20:04 but still felt  that her motivation was declining.
20:08 Whether you pioneer or not,
20:10 notice the importance  of properly digesting
20:14 our vital spiritual food.
20:30 That’s my roommate, Camille.
20:34 And, well,
20:37 that’s me.
20:40 I haven’t felt like myself recently.
20:44 I started regular pioneering  a couple of years ago.
20:48 At first, I was really zealous.
20:54 But somewhere down the line,
20:56 I lost that good feeling.
21:02 Soon, I was losing my joy  for almost everything.
21:14 I honestly didn’t know  what was wrong.
21:20 It wasn’t like I was doing  anything bad.
21:23 I thought,
21:25 ‘Maybe I’m just tired.’
21:31 But it wasn’t getting better.
21:36 I tried to assess what was going on with myself.
21:39 I felt love for Jehovah.
21:43 I felt love for the congregation,
21:45 but I felt unmotivated in my service.
21:49 I felt like something was missing.
22:03 As my enthusiasm waned,
22:06 my meeting attendance suffered too.
22:14 Thankfully, the loving elders  in my congregation noticed,
22:21 and help was on the way.
22:28 The brothers visited  to see how I was doing.
22:35 They really listened to me,
22:39 and they asked about  my spiritual routine.
22:43 Well, I read the Bible every day,
22:45 but, I admitted,  I’m not a natural study person.
22:50 They reminded me  about the example of Mary,
22:54 Jesus’ mother.
22:56 At first, I didn’t see the link,
22:58 but as we read from the Bible,  it became more clear.
23:12 Mary was known   for being a faithful woman.
23:16 But what kept her faith strong?
23:27 The Bible account said  that Mary paid careful attention
23:31 to words that had  deep spiritual meaning
23:34 and later took time to meditate,
23:37 “drawing conclusions in her heart.”
23:48 By meditating on spiritual things,
23:51 Mary strengthened her faith  and zeal for serving Jehovah.
24:00 I understand now.
24:02 I was reading spiritual food,  but I wasn’t taking time to digest it,
24:07 so it wasn’t sinking  down into my heart.
24:09 As a result,  I was on a direct path
24:13 to spiritual burnout  if I didn’t change something quick!
24:17 I began by taking control  of my busy schedule.
24:21 I made it a priority  to start my day with Bible reading.
24:25 I sought out quiet places
24:28 where I could meditate on what I read.
24:32 Meaningful Bible study reinvigorated
24:35 my passion for serving Jehovah,
24:39 and prayerful meditation
24:41 helped me to refocus.
24:48 Over time,  making these changes
24:51 helped me to find joy  in my service to Jehovah again.
25:03 The Bible says when we make time
25:06 to read and meditate on spiritual things,
25:10 we will become  “like a tree planted by streams of water,”
25:15 with foliage that never withers.
25:18 And everything we do will succeed.
25:28 Did you notice that our sister  read the Bible every day?
25:32 But that alone did not give her  the spiritual sustenance she needed.
25:37 We don’t want our Bible reading  to become an automatic process.
25:41 What does that mean —automatic process?
25:45 Well, breathing, walking,  or perhaps, riding a bicycle
25:50 are things many can do  without even thinking.
25:53 They become automatic processes.
25:57 To some extent,  this is also true of reading.
26:00 So, what can help us  develop the art of meditation?
26:04 When you finish reading a passage,
26:07 you might pause  and ponder over what you have just read
26:10 to be sure  that you understand it correctly.
26:13 Ask yourself:
26:15 ‘What does this  teach me about Jehovah?
26:18 ‘How can I apply this in my life?
26:21 Or how can I use this  in my field ministry?’
26:25 You should always make sure  to apply what you read.
26:29 And remember,  reading in a stress-free environment
26:33 with few distractions  helps our concentration.
26:37 But what if our attention span is short
26:40 and our mind starts to wander quickly?
26:43 Starting out with shorter study sessions
26:46 and gradually lengthening them  have helped some.
26:50 Our goal should be to linger in study,
26:53 not to rush through it.
26:55 That’s when our spiritual food  becomes the refreshment we need.
27:01 Some excellent tools  when meditating are the illustrations
27:05 and photographs  we find in our publications.
27:09 Take the Bible account  found in Daniel chapter 5 as an example.
27:14 It reads: “That very night
27:18 “Belshazzar  the Chaldean king was killed.
27:21 “And Darius the Mede  received the kingdom;
27:25 he was about 62 years old.”
27:28 Using other scriptures  that provide additional details,
27:33 including prophecies about the event,
27:36 the Art Department  at world headquarters
27:39 was able to paint a vivid picture  of what it may have been like that night,
27:43 when the Medo-Persian soldiers  waded through the Euphrates River
27:47 and entered the city of Babylon  through its open gates.
27:52 Now, we know that looking up  illustrations in our literature
27:57 can be a helpful tool when meditating.
28:00 But why is that the case?
28:03 Let’s go behind the scenes  of the Art Department and find out.
28:13 A visual aid often makes  a clearer
28:16 or more lasting impression  on the mind than does the spoken word.
28:24 Under the direction  of the Writing Committee,
28:27 the Art Department  has enjoyed
28:29 the privilege of designing  and illustrating Bible literature
28:33 for almost 40 years.
28:35 The department was established  sometime before 1976.
28:40 But a small team of artists
28:42 had been working  on illustrations and typography
28:46 from as far back  as the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
28:52 The work of publishing Bible literature  has seen many changes.
28:57 Now there are EPUBs, interactive PDFs,
29:01 Web design, and HTML content,
29:05 all of which require new skills
29:09 as well as close collaboration
29:11 with many other Bethel departments.
29:15 The Art Department  is structured into teams.
29:19 Each team is made up  of designers, photographers,
29:22 illustrators, prop and set makers,
29:26 costume and makeup artists,
29:29 as well as production workers.
29:33 The team lead and the scheduler  work directly
29:35 with the Writing Department contact  known as a compiler.
29:39 After receiving  an early version of the text,
29:42 the three brothers discuss
29:44 the purpose  and possible look of the design.
29:47 All on the team  are invited to collaborate
29:50 as concepts are developed.
29:52 Each member contributes  to the overall design of a project.
29:59 Before any production work is started,
30:01 concepts are sketched and developed.
30:06 These sketches become a blueprint
30:09 that helps the team  understand the concept,
30:13 plan the resources,
30:16 and ensure  that the project stays on track.
30:23 Who is the target audience?
30:26 How will this publication be used?
30:29 The design should be clear and simple.
30:36 And it needs to work in all languages.
30:40 This is no small task.
30:44 When the design is ready,
30:47 the compiler presents a mock-up  of the publication
30:50 to the Writing Committee.
30:52 The committee reviews the design  and makes any needed adjustments.
30:57 After the concept is approved,  production begins.
31:03 Around the world,  there are many photographers
31:06 who work part-time to assist  in providing images.
31:12 Photographs are also taken in our studio
31:15 and other locations.
31:18 These images help give our publications  an international look.
31:27 Accuracy is vital.
31:30 A researcher provides  historical references and inspiration.
31:36 Hair, makeup, and costumes
31:40 are designed to depict  the time period and region.
31:45 Props, set design, and lighting
31:48 provide the right look and setting.
31:51 When combined,
31:53 each element helps tell the story
31:56 and capture the imagination of the viewer.
32:00 Sets are also built in 3D programs.
32:03 They can be used as art source
32:06 or as final illustrations.
32:18 Whether painted digitally  or with traditional materials,
32:22 the artist renders the illustration
32:25 in a style suited for its final use.
32:32 When design meets illustration,
32:35 infographics are born.
32:42 After final approval  by the Writing Committee,
32:45 files are sent to the printeries
32:47 and to the website  or used to create other digital versions.
32:54 In order to reach the hearts of those  who read a Bible-based publication,
32:59 hands and hearts  have to be involved in its creation.
33:04 Those of us in the Art Department
33:07 consider it a privilege to give support  to the most urgent of all work
33:13 —preaching the good news.
33:28 Did you notice  the answer to our question,
33:31 Why can looking up illustrations  in our literature be helpful?
33:35 As the narrator said, “A visual aid
33:39 “often makes a clearer  or more lasting impression on the mind
33:43 than does the spoken word.”
33:45 But on top of that,
33:47 illustrations  can help a story come alive.
33:50 They help us  envision an event before our eyes
33:54 and thus deepen our appreciation  for Bible truths
33:58 and ultimately for Jehovah God.
34:00 While illustrations and photographs  can be a great complement,
34:05 it’s the written Word, God’s Word,
34:08 that is the source  of the spiritual food.
34:13 But what if we face a situation  in which we have access to nothing?
34:17 We are not allowed  to have a Bible,
34:20 no literature with illustrations,
34:23 no videos,  and no audio recordings.
34:26 What do we do?
34:28 Our recollection  of what we have read in the past
34:32 can keep our spirituality intact.
34:35 One of our brothers from Russia  faced such a situation.
34:39 Notice what helped him.
34:48 The year was 1963.
34:51 I was 36 at the time.
34:56 The KGB searched my home  and found some Bible literature
35:00 and some publishers’ field service reports.
35:04 So I was sentenced  to five years of imprisonment
35:07 for being an organizer.
35:10 That was the third time  I had been imprisoned.
35:14 Some brothers and sisters  and I went to the court
35:17 to support Brother Vladimir.
35:20 When he saw us,  he clasped his hands
35:23 and declared,  “Everything is fine!”
35:29 A KGB officer told me
35:32 that the only reason  I hadn’t been imprisoned
35:34 was because I had six children.
35:36 But Vladimir was single.
35:38 I was just glad  that they had arrested me and not him,
35:41 because I didn’t have a family.
35:48 In the camp, I didn’t have a Bible  or any Bible literature at all.
35:53 All I had to keep me going  was the knowledge I already had.
35:58 We prayed for him,  and we sent greetings
36:01 and encouraging messages  to him through his relatives.
36:05 Due to the strict censorship  in the camp,
36:07 we were not allowed  to write anything spiritual in our letters
36:10 to encourage each other.
36:12 If we did,  the letters were confiscated.
36:17 But I really wanted to send Brother Mikhail  something encouraging.
36:24 I was growing flowers  with a group of inmates in the camp.
36:26 So instead of a sending him a letter,
36:28 I decided to send him  a bouquet of flowers.
36:35 Vladimir’s sister Olga came to our home,
36:38 and she brought me a beautiful bouquet  of flowers from Vladimir.
36:47 I couldn’t believe  that I had received fresh flowers
36:51 from behind a barbed-wire fence —from inside the camp.
36:57 I was so touched  by his act of kindness
36:59 that my heart moved me  to write down some verses,
37:02 a poem,  which I called “The Bouquet.”
37:08 My relatives came  and visited me in the prison
37:11 and delivered to me the poem.
37:14 I kept the poem  in a very secret place.
37:17 It could have been confiscated,
37:19 and I could have been punished  because it was about God.
37:24 After Vladimir was released from prison,
37:27 well, he told me that my poem  had really strengthened him
37:31 and that he had often taken it out
37:33 of its secret hiding place  to read it over and over again.
37:39 If it hadn’t been for the support  I received from Jehovah
37:42 and the prayers of friends,
37:44 it would have been much harder  for me to serve my time.
37:48 The poem that I had received  helped me not to feel
37:52 separated from my friends
37:54 and, most importantly,  from Jehovah.
37:59 So many years have now gone by.
38:02 But we have remained firm  through the difficult times,
38:05 and we continue serving Jehovah.
38:11 Lately, Vladimir and I have been trying  to keep in touch by phone,
38:15 but we haven’t seen each other  for seven years.
38:19 I would really love  to see Vladimir again.
38:24 He doesn’t know  that I’ve decided to go and visit him.
38:28 I hope that he likes the surprise.
39:04 “I see these flowers,  grown by hands
39:07 “Hardened from work  that prison demands.
39:09 “My friend has sent a bouquet.
39:12 “Prison three times  prevented our meeting,
39:14 “But you found a way  to convey a greeting.
39:18 “My joy now moves me to say:
39:21 “‘Greetings, my brother,  with all of my heart.
39:24 “‘You gave me strength,  although we’re apart.
39:27 “‘While you have  countless trials withstood,
39:30 “‘You’ve strengthened me  as best you could.
39:33 “‘Greetings, my friend  on that narrow road,
39:37 “‘You were always with me  through hardships untold.
39:40 “‘We worked so hard  for spiritual treasure.
39:43 “‘Blessed we were  for sticking together.
39:47 “‘Cruelly, my friend,  you were taken from me
39:50 “‘When they tried  to break our integrity.
39:53 “‘But God stood by us  and helped us to cope.
39:57 “‘Conquer the evil, we did,  for our dear Kingdom hope.
40:02 “‘How grateful we are  and always will be
40:05 “‘For spiritual vision   by which we can see
40:09 “‘The crown of life  promised to those
40:12 “‘Who stay on the loyal course  they chose.
40:16 “‘How much you’ve endured,  long-suffering friend.
40:19 “‘But Jehovah’s mercy  will never end.
40:22 “‘On a paradise earth  our hands will unite,
40:25 “‘Planting more flowers  to gladden His sight.
40:29 “‘Christ Jesus will heal us  during his reign,
40:33 “‘So no trace of sin  will ever remain.
40:36 “‘And far from the trials  that we overcame,
40:39 Forever we’ll praise  Jehovah’s great name!’”
40:48 True friends are such a blessing  from Jehovah,
40:51 and you don’t really know  who they are until disaster strikes.
41:00 During my whole life,  walking in the way of the truth,
41:04 I have often thought  about the words of Psalm 119:63,
41:09 where it says:
41:11 “I am a friend of all who fear you
41:13 and of those who keep your orders.”
41:16 Our serving side by side  in the Kingdom work
41:20 has strengthened our friendship.
41:25 It is only that sort of friendship  that will last forever!
41:35 What a beautiful friendship!
41:38 Our brotherhood truly is  a blessing from Jehovah.
41:42 Brother Mikhail Savitsky spent many years  as a circuit overseer,
41:47 helping the Kingdom work progress  in Siberia, northern Caucasus,
41:52 and the countries  of Georgia and Armenia.
41:55 In 1992, he had the privilege  of being one of those
42:00 who signed the documents that confirmed  legal recognition of our work in Russia.
42:06 However, we regret to inform you
42:09 that some time  after this segment was produced,
42:12 Brother Vladimir Varkholik  fell asleep in death.
42:15 He was 88 years old
42:17 and had served Jehovah faithfully  for over 59 years.
42:21 At the time of his death,
42:23 he had served as a pioneer  for some 26 years
42:26 and as an elder  in the congregation for 43 years.
42:31 From his interview,  you can clearly see the faith
42:35 that kept his spirituality strong  through 12 years of imprisonment.
42:40 And he is a good example for us.
42:44 Did you notice one aspect  of his circumstances while incarcerated?
42:49 He said:
42:51 “In the camp,  I didn’t have a Bible
42:54 “or any Bible literature at all.
42:56 “All I had to keep me going
42:59 was the knowledge I already had.”
43:01 That could happen to us.
43:03 When persecution starts,  we need to be prepared.
43:07 That’s one reason  why it is so important
43:10 not to neglect  our study of the Bible
43:13 while we have the opportunity.
43:15 Now, back to David.
43:18 Thanks, Rocky.  We’re truly sorry to hear about Vladimir.
43:23 But one thing is certain,  we know that Jehovah God will not forget
43:27 the love that he showed for His name.
43:30 That was a moving interview indeed.
43:34 Well, back in June,
43:36 a number of new Kingdom songs  were released electronically,
43:40 but one was missing—number 151.
43:44 Now, you noticed that, didn’t you?
43:46 I know you did because nothing escapes  the eagle eyes of you brothers and sisters.
43:51 Well, here it is, number 151.
43:54 It’s entitled  “The Revealing of God’s Sons.”
43:58 And it reminds us  that the time is getting near
44:01 when the anointed  will hear the final call.
44:04 Let’s listen.
44:16 The time is near when God reveals His faithful chosen ones.
44:25 In heaven they will rule with Christ As mighty spirit sons.
44:35 The sons of God will be revealed Along with Christ, their Lord.
44:45 They’ll join him in his victory And share in his reward.
44:56 And soon the last remaining ones Will hear his final call.
45:06 The King of kings and Lord of lords Will then collect them all.
45:15 The sons of God will be revealed Along with Christ, their Lord.
45:25 They’ll join him in his victory And share in his reward.
45:37 And then with Christ, these sons of God Will wage the final war.
45:47 The joyous marriage to the Lamb Will last forevermore.
45:56 The sons of God will be revealed Along with Christ, their Lord.
46:06 They’ll join him in his victory And share in his reward.
46:18 Don’t you think that was  a beautiful song, Rocky?
46:21 Absolutely!
46:22 That was one beautiful song.
46:24 You know, I really do appreciate  the Watchtower chorus.
46:27 Only two or three of them  have professional training,
46:30 and the rest have got where they are  just through hard work.
46:34 So this is something  that all of us can keep in mind.
46:36 Practice, practice, practice singing.
46:39 And then when you  get to the Kingdom Hall, sing out.
46:43 And it’s a very timely song,  considering how close we are to the end.
46:48 And I’m sure all of you agree that the closer we are to the end of this system of things,
46:52 the more work there is  in the field ministry.
46:55 But there are individuals whom we  rarely find home due to their secular work.
47:01 In Europe, our brothers  and sisters have found a way
47:04 to reach one such group.
47:16 Every year, thousands of truck drivers  from all over the world
47:20 crisscross the European continent.
47:24 They work hard to make ends meet  for their families
47:28 but often have to spend  weeks away from home.
47:32 Jesus and his apostles  approached people wherever they were.
47:36 It is this same spirit  that must motivate us.
47:40 By trying to reach truck drivers  wherever they can be found,
47:44 we can make sure  that everyone receives a witness,
47:47 even those who would  otherwise be missed.
47:50 We live in the Rotterdam area  which has a lot of truck traffic.
47:54 We cover our regular territory  once every three months,
47:57 while these truck drivers  are hardly ever reached.
48:02 We noticed that 300,000 trucks  crossed France every year.
48:06 Thus, it was necessary to explore
48:09 this formidable potential for the ministry.
48:14 Many truck drivers use truck stops
48:16 to take a short break or even spend the night there.
48:19 That’s ideal for preaching.
48:26 While we are parked here, resting,
48:29 we are cleaning the trucks;
48:32 we are washing our clothes  because there is no laundry here;
48:36 and also we do our cooking.
48:44 One day on my way to France,
48:46 I had to stop in Austria
48:49 to swap drivers.
48:52 My colleague went to the bathroom,  and I was alone.
48:56 At that moment, a Witness came  and offered me a magazine.
49:02 Much effort is being put into reaching  truck drivers in an organized way.
49:08 We made sure all truck stops  were mapped
49:10 and organized schedules so that pioneers
49:13 can preach in this territory  at least once a day.
49:19 Publishers will encounter  many different nationalities and languages.
49:25 The language barrier  is one of the biggest challenges.
49:27 On any given morning,  you can encounter
49:29 up to ten different languages:  Romanian, Russian, Polish.
49:36 When I looked at the magazine,  I saw that it was a Watchtower,
49:39 but I thought it was in German.
49:41 I told this brother  that I did not speak German.
49:46 Then he had a look at my license plate  and saw that it was Romanian.
49:50 He again offered me  the magazine and told me:
49:53 “It is Romanian.  It is for you.”
49:56 When I saw it,  I was very happy.
49:59 I took the magazine  and was very glad.
50:05 Of course, we don’t speak in tongues  like the first-century Christians did.
50:08 But jw.org makes us feel like  we can preach in any language.
50:16 We need to go further  than just distributing publications.
50:20 We need to be real teachers,  and to do that,
50:23 we can make use of the videos.
50:30 A driver had his Bible  wide open on his dashboard
50:34 and literally cried when he watched  the video Why Study the Bible?
50:41 Since truck drivers spend  most of their time on the road,
50:45 it is a real challenge to follow up  on those who have shown any interest.
50:52 It’s very difficult to do return visits  or to start Bible studies.
50:55 You just don’t know when you will meet  a truck driver again.
50:58 So we try to get their e-mail addresses  as soon as possible.
51:06 The results were remarkable.
51:08 For example, in the last service year,
51:11 about 100,000 magazines were placed,
51:14 100 Bible studies were started,
51:17 and 4,000 videos were shown.
51:23 Experience shows  that even if it’s not possible
51:26 to obtain an e-mail address,
51:28 the slightest witness given  can have a great impact.
51:34 In time, I returned to Romania.
51:37 I started a Bible study,  progressed spiritually, got married,
51:41 and now I am  an unbaptized publisher.
51:43 The brother that first  contacted me has no idea.
51:49 Hebrews 6:11 invites us all
51:51 ‘to show industriousness’ in our ministry.
51:56 The more you invest in  this form of ministry,
51:59 the more fulfillment you get  from the positive response of the drivers.
52:07 It is a good thing  to preach the good news at truck stops
52:10 because all drivers need to feel God’s love,
52:14 to see that God really cares for us.
52:18 And like me,  they can make changes in their lives.
52:25 And they need to see that Jehovah   has promised a future paradise
52:29 and how this will affect them
52:31 and their families.
52:37 What great results  came from this preaching initiative,
52:40 and what a delight to see
52:42 how many of the publishers  used our videos while witnessing!
52:46 Although videos can be great tools,
52:49 we all must continue  to develop our teaching skills
52:53 and our ability to reason  from the Scriptures.
52:57 The brothers witnessing  at truck stops did just that,
53:00 and the results  speak for themselves.
53:03 You will be happy to know that one  of the truck drivers who was interviewed
53:08 Ion Bolbotina from Romania
53:10 was recently baptized  as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
53:14 It is beautiful  to see how our efforts
53:17 in the ministry  are blessed by Jehovah.
53:20 Sister Margarita Königer has seen
53:23 the growth of the Kingdom work  all her life.
53:26 She has served  as a missionary since 1966,
53:30 and we met her in Hungary,
53:32 where she has now served  for about nine years.
59:11 In the 50 years  since she graduated from Gilead,
59:14 Sister Königer has learned  seven languages
59:17 and has served  in five different countries.
59:20 And recently,  she received a new assignment
59:23 —the Chinese field  in Munich, Germany.
59:27 Daily reading  and meditating on God’s Word, the Bible,
59:31 has given her  the strength she needs
59:34 to continue with joy  in her missionary assignment.
59:38 The same is important  if you’re young.
59:41 Taking the time  to properly digest spiritual food,
59:46 by enhancing your Bible reading,  can teach you to make good decisions.
59:50 For example,  whom should you choose as friends?
59:55 Pay special attention to this music video
59:58 entitled Where I Belong,
1:00:01 which will help you choose  the best friends possible.
1:00:15 Now everyone, it seems to me, Knows just the place he wants to be.
1:00:25 I know what’s right; I know what’s wrong; And, yes, I know where I belong.
1:00:35 It feels so good, so good to know Where I should be, where I should go
1:00:45 To find good friends and company Who build me up and care for me.
1:00:54 Yes, here in my heart  The feelings are strong.
1:01:04 Jehovah, it’s you  Who’ll help me get through
1:01:14 And show me where I belong.
1:01:29 My heart is sure, it’s clear to me, I’m standing where I want to be.
1:01:38 I read God’s Word. I make it live. It moves my heart. What can I give?
1:01:48 And now I know; yes, now I see Where real friends are; that’s where I’ll be.
1:01:58 They’re all I want; they’re family; Jehovah’s gift with love to me.
1:02:07 Yes, here in my heart The feelings are strong.
1:02:18 Jehovah, it’s you Who’ll help me get through
1:02:28 And show me where I belong.
1:02:43 What a fine young man!
1:02:45 And he made the right decisions.
1:02:47 He decided he belongs  in Jehovah’s organization.
1:02:51 And did you notice his habit?
1:02:54 He read the Bible regularly,
1:02:57 brought it with him on the trip,  meditated about what he read
1:03:01 —both after reading  and also when out in the ministry.
1:03:06 He took the time to grasp  the wonders of Jehovah’s creation,
1:03:10 and we need to do the same.
1:03:13 We need to enhance our Bible reading
1:03:16 —visualize what we read  and try to get the whole picture.
1:03:21 And the organization  has given us many fine tools
1:03:25 to visualize our Bible reading,
1:03:27 such as the illustrations  in our publications, audio dramas,
1:03:32 and dramatic Bible readings  and videos.
1:03:35 Make full use of them,
1:03:38 and meditate about what you learn.
1:03:41 Thanks, Rocky,  I agree with everything you’ve said.
1:03:45 Well, as of September the 1st,
1:03:49 members of the Bethel family  have been moving
1:03:52 from Brooklyn to our new headquarters  at Warwick, New York.
1:03:56 Now, if you’re listening in from Britain,  that’s Warwick to you.
1:04:00 Warwick or Warwick, it’s the same place.  Tomato, tomato.
1:04:05 And we’re very,  very happy about this move.
1:04:08 It’s a tremendous project  to move the entire Bethel family
1:04:12 from Brooklyn to Warwick,  and it’s going to take some time.
1:04:16 So we know you’re anxious  to see the property in person,
1:04:19 but we’re not going to be able  to get the property ready for tours
1:04:23 until April 3, 2017, that’s a Monday.
1:04:28 I’m going to repeat that.
1:04:30 We’re not going to be able  to open for tours
1:04:32 until Monday, April 3, 2017.
1:04:38 Now, if you  happen to be touring Wallkill
1:04:42 or Patterson between now and then,  it’s going to be a mighty temptation
1:04:47 for you to tiptoe  up to the property line in Warwick,
1:04:50 perhaps put some twigs  and branches in your hat,
1:04:53 climb a tree,  and see what you can see.
1:04:56 Please, don’t do it.
1:04:58 We’re working very hard  to get everything ready for you.
1:05:01 We want everything to be just right
1:05:03 when the facility is open for tours.
1:05:07 And here’s another interesting thing:
1:05:09 You are going to be able  to go online
1:05:12 and schedule a tour.
1:05:14 And so arrangements are being made  with the congregations and the branches
1:05:18 so that they’re going to be able  to do that.
1:05:20 So you’ll be able to avoid the rush.
1:05:24 We also wanted to take the opportunity  to mention that two new interviews
1:05:28 in the Viewpoints on the Origin of Life  video series
1:05:32 have now been posted.
1:05:34 You may remember this series  from the April program.
1:05:38 It’s about scientists  who have concluded
1:05:40 that life did not come about  by chance, but by design.
1:05:44 You will find these new interviews
1:05:46 in the “Interviews and Experiences”  category,
1:05:50 under the “Origins of Life” heading.
1:05:53 We’d like to conclude  with these greetings
1:05:56 from northeastern Bolivia,  in a region called Beni.
1:06:01 This area has a publisher ratio  of 1 Witness to 426 people.
1:06:07 Their territory consists  mainly of rivers and jungles.
1:06:11 The approximately 350 publishers
1:06:15 in the cities of Riberalta  and Guayaramerín
1:06:18 need to be innovative to reach  all corners of their territory.
1:06:22 For example,
1:06:24 under the direction of the local branch,  a Witness pilot
1:06:27 flies brothers to isolated populations.
1:06:30 In other cases, some communities
1:06:33 located on the banks of rivers  are reachable
1:06:35 only by boat.
1:06:37 Thus, preaching trips by boat  are arranged from time to time.
1:06:41 Some trips last well over a month.
1:06:44 But some parts of the territory  can be reached by motorcycle.
1:06:48 The brothers and sisters travel
1:06:50 up to four hours  to cover such territories.
1:06:54 The brothers and sisters in Beni  send their warm love, and so do we,
1:06:59 to all of you around the world.
1:07:02 Rocky, I’d like to thank you for doing  the heavy lifting for me during this program.
1:07:07 You’re a good brother,  you know that?
1:07:09 My privilege.
1:07:10 He’s a good brother.
1:07:11 And this is JW Broadcasting
1:07:14 in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00 Welcome to the program,  brothers and sisters!
00:03 During the next hour,  you will hear the story of a brother
00:06 who previously protected  the president of a country.
00:09 But seeing the love among God’s people  made him refocus his life
00:14 to bearing witness  about the Sovereign of the universe.
00:18 We cherish our international brotherhood.
00:21 Our brothers and sisters  in the former Soviet Union took great risks
00:24 during the Cold War to convey their love
00:27 to fellow Witnesses  on the other side of the globe.
00:31 Does our love for Jehovah motivate us  to avoid living a double life?
00:35 This dramatization  will remind us of key principles
00:39 to protect us when we are tempted  to draw closer to Satan’s world.
00:43 This is the July program  of JW Broadcasting!
01:06 In the book  Insight on the Scriptures,
01:08 under the heading “Christian,”
01:10 it makes clear that claiming to be Christian
01:13 requires more than simply
01:15 a mere confession of faith.
01:17 It is more than  being a nominal Christian
01:19 —a Christian in name only.
01:22 For example,  according to the Bible,
01:24 it is necessary that belief
01:26 be demonstrated by works,  not just words.
01:30 And since we were born  as sinners,
01:33 those who become Christians  need to repent,
01:36 to turn around,  to dedicate their lives to Jehovah,
01:40 to worship and serve him,
01:42 and then to submit  to water baptism.
01:45 They must keep themselves  clean from fornication,
01:48 from idolatry,  and from consuming blood.
01:52 They are to strip off  the old personality,
01:55 including such things  as fits of anger, obscene talk,
01:59 lying, stealing, drunkenness,
02:02 and as Galatians chapter 5 says:  “things like these.”
02:07 Yes, they are to bring their lives  into accord with Bible principles.
02:12 Christians are to be  kind and considerate,
02:15 mild-tempered and patient,
02:17 and are to exercise self-control.
02:20 They provide  and care for their own
02:22 and love  their neighbor as themselves.
02:25 That’s a lot, isn’t it?
02:28 It’s not a matter  of just glibly saying,
02:32 “I am a Christian.”
02:34 But despite all of those  impressive characteristics
02:37 that we just enumerated,
02:39 what did Jesus say
02:42 the main identifying quality
02:44 of a true Christian would be?
02:47 Most of you know the answer to that,  but let’s read it again
02:51 from John 13:34, 35.
02:56 It says: “I am giving you  a new commandment,
03:00 “that you love one another;  just as I have loved you,
03:04 “you also love one another.
03:07 “By this all will know  that you are my disciples
03:10 —if you have love among yourselves.”
03:15 Those are the theme verses
03:18 for my discussion  with you this month.
03:20 The topic is:
03:22 “Love—The Identifying Mark  of a Disciple of Jesus.”
03:26 Did you notice  in verse 34 that Jesus said
03:30 that he was giving them  at that time a “new commandment”?
03:35 But it sounds like  a very old commandment, doesn’t it?
03:39 Why, over 1,500 years
03:41 before Jesus said  the words we just read,
03:44 the Law given to Moses said:
03:46 “You must love  your fellow man as yourself.”
03:51 —Leviticus 19:18.
03:53 So, what was “new”  about Jesus’ command
03:57 in John chapter 13?
03:59 He said that true Christians  were to love each other
04:03 “just as I have loved you.”
04:07 That is what was different.
04:09 That was new,
04:12 not just love the other person  as you love yourself,
04:15 but love him just like
04:18 Jesus loved His followers.
04:21 Well, what kind of love  would that be?
04:24 Self-sacrificing love —and usually we think
04:28 of Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice,
04:30 his willingly giving his life
04:33 so that we might have the hope  of everlasting life.
04:37 But when you think about it,  that aspect of Jesus’ love
04:41 was exemplified  in a self-sacrificing death!
04:45 Now, it is true,  that as a Christian,
04:47 we might at some time have to give  our life for a fellow Christian.
04:52 But we hope  it doesn’t come to that.
04:54 So instead of talking  about a self-sacrificing death,
04:59 we want to discuss  showing this new kind of love
05:03 as evidenced  in a self-sacrificing life,
05:07 not necessarily our death.
05:10 You see, Jesus’ life —his three-and-a-half-year ministry—
05:15 was a self-sacrificing life  of loving others.
05:20 In addition to doing good
05:24 when something requires it,
05:26 a true follower of Jesus
05:28 is to take  the initiative to help others
05:31 spiritually and otherwise.
05:33 He is to work actively  for their good.
05:37 The preaching and teaching  of the good news to others
05:40 —some of whom may even be hostile—
05:43 is one of the greatest expressions  of love, for it can result
05:48 in everlasting life  to the recipients.
05:51 However,  according to Paul’s words
05:53 at 1 Thessalonians 2:8,
05:57 a true Christian must  ‘impart not only the good news of God
06:02 but also his very self’
06:05 in helping those who  accept the good news.
06:08 It’s that kind of love
06:11 that Jesus said would be  an identifying mark of his disciples,
06:16 not specifically that his followers
06:19 would all be dying for each other,
06:22 but more so that they  would all be living for each other.
06:27 Yes, displaying self-sacrificing love
06:30 for one another  every day of their lives.
06:33 The four Gospels  are a treasure trove
06:36 of Jesus’ self-sacrificing love.
06:39 And yet,  they do not cover his actions
06:42 every day of his life  as the Christ.
06:45 His three-and-a-half-year ministry
06:48 amounts to nearly
1,300 days of life and love.
06:53 The written record  of Jesus’ life is admittedly brief,
06:57 but it is grand indeed!
07:00 However, the reality  of observing Jesus every day
07:04 must have been far grander  than what we have in print.
07:08 What we have in print  might be likened
07:10 to a photo album  of Jesus’ life,
07:14 some snapshots.
07:16 By comparison,  what his apostles experienced
07:20 with Jesus day after day
07:23 was like a continuous video  of his example of love.
07:28 No wonder that,  at John 21:25,
07:33 the apostle said:
07:35 “There are also . . .
07:37 “many other things that Jesus did,
07:40 “which if ever they were written  in full detail,
07:44 “I suppose the world itself
07:46 could not contain the scrolls written.”
07:50 It said there were  ‘many other things Jesus did,’
07:55 not many other things  that he said,
07:58 but that he did,  yes, deeds or acts
08:03 demonstrating  his self-sacrificing life of love!
08:06 We already mentioned  the all-important preaching work
08:10 as being an act  of love on our part.
08:13 But how else  do we manifest
08:15 the most obvious trait  of a genuine Christian
08:19 —love like Jesus had?
08:23 Let’s start by thinking  of the elders in the congregation.
08:27 At Philippians 2:17,
08:30 Paul said that he  had ‘poured himself out
08:34 to the congregation  like a drink offering.’
08:37 What did that mean?
08:39 It meant that he  drained himself out,
08:42 both physically and emotionally,
08:44 to support the Philippians.
08:47 Many of the elders  in our congregations
08:49 have the same self-sacrificing love
08:51 for those under their care.
08:53 They give of their time  to shepherd
08:56 and readjust those in need.
08:58 They take the lead  in the ministry.
09:00 They respond when there is
09:02 a serious health issue or tragedy.
09:04 They pour themselves out for the friends,  thus identifying themselves
09:09 as disciples of Christ.
09:12 But we do not have  to be an elder
09:15 to provide a word  of encouragement, do we?
09:18 If we all keep focused  on others in the congregation,
09:22 not just ourselves,
09:24 we will know  who needs to be bolstered
09:27 because of trials  or circumstances that they face.
09:31 Giving in this way  is evidence of Christlike love.
09:36 You may be thinking,  ‘But I’m just a little old sister
09:40 ‘who finds it hard to squeeze out
09:42 a word of encouragement to others.’
09:45 Perhaps you don’t have  to say anything,
09:48 just be there
09:51 at the meetings  or in the service.
09:54 When others see your face,  they are encouraged.
09:57 Follow along  as I read Acts 28:15.
10:02 It reads:  “From there the brothers,
10:05 “when they heard the news about us,
10:08 “came as far  as the Marketplace of Appius
10:11 “and Three Taverns to meet us.
10:13 “On catching sight of them,
10:17 “Paul thanked God
10:19 and took courage.”
10:22 Paul “took courage”
10:25 just by seeing the brothers  who came out to meet him.
10:29 You encourage your brothers
10:31 and sisters by your presence.
10:34 Please follow along as I read
10:36 Philippians 2:1-4.
10:41 Paul here describes it  as “encouragement in Christ.”
10:45 He says:
10:47 “If, then, there is  any encouragement in Christ,
10:51 “if any consolation of love,
10:54 “if any spiritual fellowship,
10:57 “if any tender affection  and compassion,
11:00 “make my joy full by being
11:03 “of the same mind  and having the same love,
11:07 “being completely united,  having the one thought in mind.
11:11 “Do nothing out of contentiousness  or out of egotism,
11:15 “but with humility
11:17 “consider others superior to you,
11:21 “as you look out not only  for your own interests,
11:25 but also for the interests of others.”
11:29 Did you notice  the self-sacrificing aspect
11:32 of this love and encouragement?
11:34 Yes, he talked about having love,  but then he said,
11:38 “not . . . for your own interests,  but . . . for the interests of others.”
11:43 That type of love —in the interests of others—
11:47 is the identifying mark  of true Christians.
11:51 What about visiting  the sick in your congregation
11:54 or those who are housebound?
11:56 Sometimes these dear ones are  “out of sight, out of mind.”
12:01 We visit with those we see  when at the Kingdom Hall,
12:05 but do we think about those  who are shut-ins?
12:10 What was a major part  of Jesus’ loving acts when on earth?
12:14 There are numerous accounts  of Jesus and his apostles
12:18 healing the sick.
12:20 It’s true that we  cannot heal the sick,
12:23 but it is in our power  to visit the sick.
12:28 And what a healing  that is to their spirit!
12:31 It means so much when
12:33 they are not just prayed for  at a meeting,
12:37 but when those words of prayer  are backed up
12:40 with an act of love —a visit to them in person.
12:44 That is Christlike love in action.
12:49 Why not scroll down the list  of those in your service group
12:54 with the thought in mind  of checking on those
12:56 who have been missing  from the meetings?
12:59 Do they need a meal?
13:01 Do they need some help
13:04 perhaps around the house?
13:06 Do they need transportation  to the doctor?
13:09 Can we allow our love  to expand to fill their needs?
13:14 Contributing to the worldwide work,
13:16 which cares for the needs  of our brothers around the world,
13:19 is another act of love.
13:21 It demonstrates that we are  a true disciple of Christ.
13:26 Related to that, many of you have,  at your own expense,
13:30 traveled to far-flung places
13:33 to help rebuild  after a natural disaster has struck.
13:37 The overwhelming response  from the victims is evidence
13:41 of your self-sacrificing life  and love for your brothers.
13:46 It is hoped  that the reminder of Jesus
13:49 at John 13:34, 35  will be good for all of us,
13:53 not just for this month,
13:56 but for our whole course of life.
13:59 You know, about one third  of the world’s population
14:03 claims to be Christian.
14:05 But how many of them  show self-sacrificing love
14:09 outside of their immediate family?
14:12 Most are like a baseball team  in a uniform.
14:15 They think having the word “Christian”
14:18 emblazoned across the front  of their uniform
14:21 is all that is required.
14:23 However, most of them  simply “sit on the bench,”
14:27 or on a pew in church,
14:30 and many do not even attend  “the game.”
14:33 They do not live  the life of a Christian.
14:37 Jesus made clear  that being a true disciple of his
14:41 is not merely  “wearing a uniform,”
14:44 simply claiming to be  his follower.
14:47 No, it involves
14:49 actively demonstrating  works of love,
14:53 “swinging hard for the team,”
14:55 imitating the all-time greatest examples  of love,
15:00 Jehovah God and his Son,  Jesus Christ.
15:03 As Paul said  at 2 Corinthians 8:8,
15:07 we need “to test  the genuineness of [our] love.”
15:12 Yes, we need to daily prove
15:15 that we are  a genuine disciple of Jesus.
15:19 Brother Reinmueller will now  share some examples of how
15:24 the Bible principles  we just discussed
15:26 have helped people  around the world.
15:28 Alex.
15:29 Thank you, Brother Herd,  for that warm encouragement.
15:32 We’re more motivated than ever
15:34 to prove our love for Jehovah and others.
15:36 We recently met Mamuka Tektumanashvili,
15:40 from the country of Georgia.
15:41 He was a high-ranking officer  in the special forces there for many years.
15:46 What made him realize  that defending his country
15:50 is not the highest honor  a man can have in his life?
15:53 This is his story.
16:18 For 18 years  I served in a special unit
16:21 responsible  for presidential security.
16:23 This mission  demanded total self-sacrifice.
16:27 For example,  the first and the last vehicles
16:29 of the presidential escort  belonged to this unit.
16:32 So if an attack  occurred on the president,
16:34 we were the first ones  to be hit with the fire.
16:43 For the last ten years  of service, I worked
16:45 as an instructor  and trained new staff
16:47 to provide  presidential security in the future.
16:50 Those working in this field  must be fearless.
16:53 They must be professionals,
16:55 and that is what I taught  to succeeding generations.
17:03 I just loved my job.
17:05 I was a fervent patriot.
17:07 I had a special regard  for the flag of my country.
17:10 In one bag,  I always had weapons and the flag.
17:16 Patriotism  was so deep-rooted in me
17:18 that I would beat up a person
17:20 simply because he was  of another nationality.
17:25 I always thought  that God would never allow
17:27 people like me  to draw close to him.
17:30 One day, Jehovah’s Witnesses came  and preached to my wife and me.
17:33 We were so interested  in the truth that my wife
17:35 even expressed  a desire to study the Bible.
17:38 Because there were rumors  circulating about Jehovah’s Witnesses,
17:41 I decided first to make sure that everything was decent at their meetings
17:45 and only then allow my wife  to associate with them.
17:48 After the meeting,  I was absolutely thrilled.
17:50 Everyone was well-mannered,  with friendly, smiling faces.
17:54 I realized that there was nothing there  to threaten my wife’s well-being.
17:59 On the contrary, their association  would be beneficial for her.
18:03 Soon my wife  and our eldest daughter got baptized.
18:07 As for me, I enjoyed associating  with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
18:10 Later, I also started  to study the Bible.
18:13 I knew that I had to make  drastic changes in my life,
18:16 but my job  prevented me from doing so.
18:20 Moreover, I felt  that door-to-door preaching
18:23 was far more difficult  than engaging in combat.
18:26 I respected Jehovah’s Witnesses  for their courage and strength.
18:32 Little by little,  I too was changing for the better.
18:35 I wanted to quit my job and inform  my colleagues about my religious beliefs.
18:42 So I wrote down all the Bible verses  I had recently learned
18:46 and then pinned them  on the wall in my office.
18:50 I also started to think  about how to make a living
18:53 after leaving my job  and decided to learn a trade.
18:56 I started to buy tools  in order to be ready
18:59 to take care of my family.
19:01 I realized that the time  had come to make a decision.
19:06 The day I quit my job
19:08 was one of the happiest days  of my life.
19:12 Since then, I’ve been able  to dedicate every minute of my life
19:15 to Jehovah  with a clean conscience.
19:17 In a few months, I got baptized.
19:21 In the beginning,  we were hardly making a living.
19:24 However, this taught me  to trust in Jehovah.
19:27 I tried my best to keep  service to Jehovah in first place.
19:31 I deeply appreciate  the support of my brothers
19:33 and sisters  and association with them.
19:48 Before, I used to carry out  the orders of men
19:51 —some of which  I carried out reluctantly.
19:53 But now I am happy to carry out
19:55 an assignment from Jehovah  with the same spirit
19:57 that the prophet Isaiah had,  who said:
20:00 “Here I am! Send me!”
20:02 As a family, we decided to move  where the need was greater,
20:06 and this has united  our family even more.
20:11 This is the bag
20:13 in which  I always carried weapons,
20:15 but now they are replaced  with a Bible and Bible literature.
20:19 In the past, I thought
20:21 I could never preach  from door to door.
20:23 But now I can say with conviction
20:25 that the words of Jesus  have proved true in my case:
20:28 “All things are possible with God.”
20:37 Brother Tektumanashvili  now serves as an elder,
20:40 and he has also been  a regular pioneer since 2014.
20:45 While Brother Tektumanashvili  served the government for many years,
20:49 there are those who live  on the other side of the law.
20:52 How does Jehovah’s unprejudiced love  reach out to them?
20:56 Join us as we travel
20:58 to the Democratic Republic of Congo  in Africa,
21:01 where our brothers make  special efforts to reach people
21:05 we would not normally  find from door to door.
21:13 I could say that my past  was really an unhappy past.
21:19 I went through very difficult times  during my childhood.
21:23 I lost hope
21:25 that I could ever have  a better life.
21:29 Because of that,
21:31 I started to associate  with the wrong people in my life.
21:37 One night, I was arrested  and sent to Buluo Prison.
21:41 It is a high-security prison  in Congo.
21:50 Prison is a very dangerous place.
21:53 But I was surprised how they  accepted the truth so easily.
21:56 Really, I was amazed.
21:59 We needed to obtain permission
22:02 to be able to continue  to preach in the prison.
22:04 We had so enjoyed  the preaching work there.
22:11 I went to see the authorities in the city  to find out what was required
22:14 so that we could have permission  to preach in the prison.
22:20 To my great amazement,  they simply handed me a paper
22:24 and told me to put  my request in writing.
22:27 They asked me to wait.
22:29 Within minutes,  I had the authorization
22:32 in my hands  without paying anything at all.
22:35 Every time the situation
22:37 seemed insurmountable to us,
22:39 impossible to us,
22:41 we saw the hand of Jehovah
22:43 providing us  with the suitable solution.
22:49 The authorization gave a great boost
22:52 to this special witnessing initiative.
22:54 In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23,
22:58 the brothers could then  ‘become all things to people of all sorts,
23:02 so that they might  by all possible means save some.’
23:07 Some religious leaders  who were also prisoners
23:11 were extremely opposed  to our presence.
23:14 They conspired and had us  thrown out of our meeting place.
23:20 The prisoners themselves  were concerned about this.
23:24 They found another meeting place  even more spacious than the former.
23:35 Since Buluo is eight kilometers  away from our congregation,
23:39 to transport the group who support  the preaching work and meetings,
23:42 the body of elders organized two minibuses
23:44 to go out every Saturday to Buluo.
23:49 Once they arrive,  they begin the preaching work at 8:30,
23:53 and at 10 o’clock  the meetings start.
23:55 All the meetings of the week  are held on the Saturday.
24:02 Concerning Jehovah’s Witnesses,  personally, I am very impressed.
24:07 It’s more than three years they’ve been  more active in helping the detainees.
24:10 The reeducation of the prisoners  is assured by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
24:14 This is a good collaboration  on the part of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
24:18 With this I’m very happy.
24:29 One hundred  and seventy-five attended
24:31 the circuit assembly  in December 2014,
24:34 which was held in the prison,  and seven were baptized.
24:38 Local media covered the event.
24:44 This is the first time I have seen  Jehovah’s Witnesses
24:47 baptized here  in the Buluo Prison.
24:49 This is a good thing.
24:51 I encourage you  to continue with this assistance.
24:55 Every week there are  more than 80 in attendance
24:58 and sometimes  more than that, even 140.
25:02 In the attendance  there are the 36 publishers
25:04 —the brothers who learned  the truth in Buluo Prison—
25:08 30 are baptized  and 6 unbaptized.
25:16 I visited many churches  because I had a lot of questions,
25:19 but I never got  any exact answers.
25:24 When I went to see  Jehovah’s Witnesses,
25:28 they gave me accurate answers  from the Bible.
25:31 To know that Jehovah  is compassionate
25:34 and ready to forgive,
25:36 these are the qualities  that touched me.
25:41 I used to be a soldier.
25:43 I was in the military.
25:45 I attended various churches
25:48 because I had a question  that bothered me a lot.
25:50 I wondered why God allows  bad things to happen
25:53 to people all the time.
25:56 While I was in prison,
26:00 Jehovah’s Witnesses came to visit  and talk to us.
26:07 I asked them  the same question,
26:09 “Why does God allow sickness  and suffering to continue?”
26:14 They replied by using  three Bible verses.
26:19 I was very happy because I received  the answer to my question.
26:28 Papy Okito is a brother
26:31 who learned  the truth in prison.
26:33 He made  such remarkable progress
26:36 that those in charge  now have confidence in him.
26:42 Like Joseph in the Bible,
26:44 he has been placed in a position  of supervision over the other prisoners.
26:48 He also made further progress,  and thus, the management has requested
26:52 that his prison sentence  be reduced.
26:56 When I arrived in the prison,  I had lost hope.
27:00 I thought for me  it was the end.
27:02 By means of the Bible,
27:04 I have found joy  and hope in my life.
27:07 That is why today I am happy  even though I am still here.
27:12 But I know  that the Paradise is for me.
27:31 It’s been five years  since the brothers
27:34 started preaching  in the Buluo Prison.
27:36 At times, the publishers place  up to 500 magazines in one weekend.
27:41 Although our success is not  measured by the number of placements,
27:45 this response does paint  a clear picture
27:47 of the spiritual thirst  among these prisoners.
27:50 In the last few months,  inside these prison walls,
27:54 11 more unbaptized publishers  have been approved.
27:57 What a loving act by Jehovah  and his organization
28:02 to help such individuals satisfy  their spiritual needs!
28:06 In the late 1950’s,
28:09 the opposition  against Jehovah’s Witnesses
28:11 in the former Soviet Union
28:13 resulted in homes being searched,  brothers being followed,
28:16 and many of our brothers  and sisters being sent
28:19 to Communist concentration camps
28:21 in Siberia,  among other places.
28:24 In 1956 and 1957,
28:27 over 462,000  convention delegates worldwide
28:32 unanimously adopted a petition
28:35 which clearly outlined the treatment  Jehovah’s Witnesses were enduring.
28:39 It was sent  to the Soviet authorities,
28:41 but sadly, not much changed.
28:45 The next year,  at the 1958 international convention
28:48 at Yankee Stadium  in New York,
28:50 a talk was given entitled  “Behind the Iron Curtain.”
28:55 During the talk,  delegates were surprised
28:58 when a recording of greetings  and songs from brothers
29:00 and sisters in the Soviet Union  was played.
29:03 Despite the risk of losing  their freedom,
29:06 the brothers produced  and sent these recordings.
29:09 Well, a few months ago,
29:11 some of those who were involved  in making the recording
29:14 were able to listen to it  for the first time
29:17 Several of them  found out only then
29:20 that the recording had been played  at the convention at Yankee Stadium.
29:24 Our team was present  at that gathering.
29:43 The brothers told us  to prepare songs for a recording.
29:48 When we were singing,  I never imagined
29:51 that it was for a convention,  because I did not know about that.
29:55 We sang as usual.
29:57 The chorus was made up  of about 20 persons,
30:01 and the recording  was made in a room
30:04 in a barrack-like building.
30:12 I just looked after the chorus  to give them the right tone.
30:17 If someone sang a little off-key,  she would right away remark:
30:21 “Altos, you are off!”  or “Tenor, you are off!”
30:26 so that there would be no slips,  no mistakes.
30:32 We had to be very careful
30:34 when we were recording.
30:37 And so we knew not to talk.
30:39 I could not tell  anyone about it.
30:41 It was secret —absolutely secret.
30:50 They chose a brother  who spoke very good Russian,
30:53 who had good intonation,  and who had a good voice.
30:56 And as I recall, we made  the recording on our first attempt.
31:03 Brother Yuriy Dobychin  said the greetings.
31:10 I was young then,  and I had a good voice.
31:13 So I had to say  the greetings
31:17 from the brothers  in the Soviet Union
31:21 for the brothers gathered  at Yankee Stadium.
31:35 As the brothers who made  the recording told me,
31:39 the most difficult assignment  for them
31:42 was how to get this recording
31:44 across the border.
31:47 The brothers cut it up  into pieces
31:50 and sewed it  into the lining of a jacket
31:53 because that’s how  confidential letters were sent.
31:57 One married couple  from Poland,
32:00 who were vacationing  in Russia,
32:02 agreed to take it  back with them
32:05 —to take it  out of the Soviet Union.
32:09 And that’s where they ran  into serious problems.
32:16 From Brother Scheider’s letter,
32:18 who received  the audio recording in Poland:
32:24 “The security officers separated  our brother from the others.
32:29 “Then an officer said to him:
32:31 ‘Please give us the film  and the three letters you have with you.’
32:35 “The brother saw now,  of course,
32:37 “that there had been  a traitor somewhere.
32:40 “He and his wife  were now thoroughly searched.
32:43 “Every square centimeter  of their cases
32:46 “was carefully examined  together with their contents.
32:49 “Then both were stripped naked.
32:51 “While this was going on,  they yelled at the brother:
32:54 ‘Tell us where you have hidden everything  or to whom you have given it!’
32:58 “They were absolutely convinced  that he had everything with him.
33:03 “Several times they took him  to the office
33:05 “of the frontier police  and to the security police,
33:08 “searching him  again and again
33:10 “and being terribly angry.
33:13 “But they finally had to give up.
33:16 “They kept him back  for 24 hours
33:18 “and questioned him  in the presence of ten specialists.
33:22 But he came out victorious.”
33:29 Sadly, even the brothers
33:32 who were involved  don’t know who this couple
33:35 who brought the tape  into Poland was.
35:25 Well, for me it was, of course, a great joy,  since the goal was reached after all.
35:28 Everything was so wonderful  at that time.
35:31 I really enjoyed it all!
35:33 Nothing could describe  the joy I felt.
35:36 I was overwhelmed with feelings.
35:45 And so my voice was recorded,  and the greetings were heard
35:50 in New York  at Yankee Stadium.
36:11 These dear brothers and sisters  have no regrets.
36:15 They are happy  that their efforts encouraged
36:17 so many thousands  back then and today.
36:20 The kind of love  these brothers and sisters showed
36:24 is often noticed  by those not in the truth.
36:27 A young couple from the United States,
36:30 Jeremiah and Holly Draper,
36:32 experienced just that.
36:41 The blessings that I enjoy today
36:44 are so numerous.
36:47 I have a true inner sense
36:50 of joy and happiness.
36:52 I can’t help  but be appreciative,
36:56 so grateful  for all that Jehovah does.
36:59 But it wasn’t  always this way for us.
37:15 It was a dark world growing up.
37:22 I never knew  what being a child was like.
37:28 I was afraid
37:30 of who I would grow up to be.
37:34 I felt like I had no choice.
37:38 Then at a very young age,  I, as well,
37:41 started to partake
37:43 of what I saw going on around me.
37:45 I learned quickly that it helped numb
37:49 the feelings that I had.
37:51 Drugs were a way  to escape that.
37:54 I was in a lot of trouble  with the law.
37:57 I knew I needed change,
37:59 so I joined the military  at a young age.
38:03 Around my teenage years,  my life became difficult.
38:08 I started to turn to drugs and alcohol  and self-destructive ways,
38:13 but none of these things  were making me happy.
38:17 I was very lonely.
38:19 No one knew me;  no one cared to know me.
38:23 I felt so lost,
38:25 and I was trying  to fill this big hole in my heart
38:29 with so many things,
38:32 and none of it worked.
38:35 One of my many car accidents,  due to drugs and alcohol,
38:39 ended me up in jail
38:43 for 30 days straight.
38:49 I felt like a hopeless mess.
38:53 I just knew  something’s got to change.
38:57 So I joined the military,
38:59 thinking it was going to be
39:01 the positive great change  that I needed,
39:05 but it was not.
39:08 I remember  joining the military
39:11 hoping that it  would bring some sort
39:13 of authority into my life,
39:15 but I again started  to spiral
39:19 into my anger, my alcohol and drug abuse.
39:23 The military decided  to let me out.
39:28 But during deployment  is where I met Holly.
39:33 Holly also got  out of the military,
39:35 and we started  to live a life together.
39:38 But we were still searching  for something to fill
39:42 the emptiness  that we both felt in our lives.
39:46 Jeremiah and I were both working  in a steel factory in Montana.
39:50 During this time,  I was being trained on a drill
39:55 by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,  a sister named Molly.
39:57 Molly said, “You’re  going to have down time
39:59 “on this machine,  maybe a couple of hours,
40:02 so feel free to read  whatever I have in my tool box.”
40:06 I opened it
40:08 and immediately  a little yellow book,
40:10 What Does the Bible Really Teach?,  caught my eye.
40:13 I loved the pictures.
40:15 The scriptures  at the beginning of the book,
40:17 they touched my heart immediately,  and I felt like,
40:21 ‘These answer all the questions
40:23 I’ve been searching  for my entire life!’
40:26 Another sister came over,  her name was Cory,
40:29 and she said: “Molly and I can come over,
40:31 “and we can talk to you  about the Bible tomorrow.
40:34 If you have any questions,  we’d love to answer them using the Bible.”
40:38 I said, “Yes, come over!”
40:41 I was a little bit  more apprehensive.
40:43 I stayed just to make sure  nothing got weird,
40:45 but this was finally
40:47 something very different.
40:50 And I realized what they were saying  came from the Bible.
40:53 I’d never seen that before.
40:55 They invited us  to the Kingdom Hall.
40:58 We went in,  everybody had their Bible,
41:01 had time to look  the scriptures up together,
41:04 and everybody was  so warm and inviting.
41:07 These were the people  I’d been searching for my entire life.
41:11 All of a sudden change  was possible.
41:13 We knew what changes  we needed to make in our life.
41:16 What we were doing,  our actions,
41:18 we had to clear out things  that Jehovah hates.
41:22 Like just going through  our house and deciding
41:24 what it is  that we need to get rid of.
41:26 By allowing the truth  to transform our lives,
41:28 Holly and I’ve received  many blessings,
41:31 and eventually we were able  to come here together and serve at Bethel.
41:35 We got the truth in a weld shop,
41:38 and now I get to weld  here in Jehovah’s house for him.
41:41 I perform maintenance  on water fountains,
41:44 refrigerators, coolers.
41:47 Being trained by the brothers  and sisters I work with
41:50 just helps me to refine  my Christian personality.
41:53 It’s so nice to know  that Jehovah
41:56 is looking down on us;
41:58 that he was able  to see through
42:00 all of the trash  that was there in our life.
42:03 He was able to find something
42:05 and decided to work with it.
42:07 And I really think of a scripture,  Psalm 145:19:
42:11 “He satisfies the desire  of those
42:16 “who fear him;  he hears their [cry] for help,
42:20 and [he] rescues them.”
42:22 Jehovah did that for us.
42:23 If you ask Jehovah  to display his hand in your life,
42:27 no doubt at all in my mind,
42:30 that will happen.
42:34 Did you notice how  Jeremiah and Holly were touched
42:38 by the Christian love shown to them
42:40 when they visited  the Kingdom Hall for the first time?
42:43 Jeremiah said that everybody
42:45 was so warm and inviting.
42:47 Yes, love truly is
42:50 the identifying mark of Jesus’ disciples.
42:53 But Jesus taught that love  for fellow believers and our neighbor
42:57 is second to our love for Jehovah.
43:00 Being kind and encouraging to others
43:03 is of little value if it’s not rooted
43:06 in a deep desire  to please our heavenly Father.
43:09 In the following dramatization,
43:12 a young brother is reminded of the value
43:14 of carefully examining his heart.
43:29 My name is Shawn.
43:31 I was raised in the truth.
43:36 I was doing everything right.
43:49 But I was doing everything wrong.
44:17 I was in my senior year of high school.
44:20 Everything was going great
44:23 until this new girl joined our school.
44:33 I really don’t know  how it even started.
44:35 We just sort of hit it off  and became good friends.
44:41 I mean, she was so easy to talk to.
45:10 Before I knew it,
45:12 we were texting all the time.
45:15 Then, one thing led to another.
45:21 Honestly, when things  started to get physical,
45:24 I thought I could control it,
45:27 but it was only getting worse.
45:41 I didn’t want to let my parents down.
45:44 So I started lying to them,
45:50 and then I started lying to myself.
45:57 I thought if I could just keep  going to the meetings and do my parts,
46:01 it could somehow be OK.
46:07 But I was far from OK.
46:14 The next night, we had family worship.
46:18 We were reading about the account  of Ananias and his wife, Sapphira.
46:29 When a special fund was set up  for needy Christians, Ananias sold a field.
46:34 But then, he boldly claimed  he was contributing
46:38 the entire proceeds of its sale.
46:41 In reality, though,  Ananias had “secretly held back
46:45 some of the price”  for his personal gain.
46:49 Peter boldly said to him:  “You have lied,
46:53 not to men, but to God.”
46:58 Jehovah wasn’t fooled  by their pretense.
47:05 Then we read Psalm 44:21:
47:09 “[God] is aware
47:11 of the secrets of the heart.”
47:24 Reading this account of Ananias  and Sapphira made me realize
47:37 I wasn’t just lying  to my parents or my friends.
47:43 I was lying to Jehovah.
47:47 As much as I didn’t want  to let my parents down,
47:50 even more so,  I didn’t want to let Jehovah down.
48:02 I prayed long that night.
48:05 I didn’t hold anything back.
48:14 By the next morning,  I knew what I wanted to do.
48:51 It wasn’t easy,  but my parents were very supportive,
48:55 and I also got the help  I needed from the elders.
49:13 It’s been a few years,  but as I look back now,
49:16 I was one of those kids  living a double life.
49:22 But now with Jehovah’s help,
49:26 I’m living the best life.
49:31 What a clear warning this is,
49:35 not only for young ones  but also for those of us
49:38 who have served Jehovah  for many, many years.
49:41 As we well know, serving Jehovah  faithfully for many decades
49:46 is only valuable  if we ‘endure to the end.’
49:49 By developing  intense love for Jehovah,
49:53 we’ll be able to overcome  whatever temptations or trials we face.
49:57 And speaking  of enduring to the end,
50:00 Brother Mark Sanderson recently spoke  at morning worship in Bethel
50:04 about how our eager expectation  of the day of Jehovah
50:08 will help us to endure faithfully  in this system of things.
50:12 Pay close attention  to some of the ways
50:15 we show such expectation.
50:18 Well, here’s the question  we want to ask this morning:
50:21 Is it actually possible  to speed up the day of Jehovah?
50:26 Well, if we look at our text this morning
50:28 at 2 Peter 3:11,
50:33 we’ve had that read for us,
50:35 so we know  that expression at the end
50:38 that we should “consider  what sort of people you ought to be
50:42 in holy acts of conduct  and deeds of godly devotion.”
50:46 But then it goes on to say:
50:48 “As you await and keep close in mind
50:52 the presence of the day of Jehovah.”
50:55 Well, now, if you look at the footnote
50:57 on this expression in verse 12,
51:00 you’ll notice that the expression
51:02 “keep close in mind” literally means
51:05 to “speed up” the day of Jehovah.
51:09 Well, now, how can we do that?
51:11 Well, it’s true we cannot bring
51:14 the day forward of Jehovah  even one day,
51:17 nor can we move it  back even one day.
51:20 That is not within our power.  That day is set.
51:24 But how can we, then,  “speed up”
51:27 the day of Jehovah  as it says there in verse 12?
51:31 Well, we keep that day  close in our mind.
51:35 We never let it be out of our sight.
51:38 As the footnote also says,
51:40 we “eagerly desire” it.
51:43 Well, now,  if we’re persons like that,
51:45 Peter says  that we’re going to be busy
51:49 in “deeds of godly devotion.”
51:51 Well, now,  just as a quick reminder:
51:53 What is godly devotion?
51:55 Well, just looking  at our New World Translation glossary,
51:59 here’s the definition:
52:01 It’s “reverence, worship,
52:04 “and service to Jehovah God,
52:07 with loyalty  to his universal sovereignty.”
52:11 Well, what do we get  from that definition?
52:13 Did you notice —reverence, worship, service?
52:17 You see, godly devotion  is not passive; it’s active.
52:22 It’s reflected  in action and in activity.
52:26 Well, that’s why the apostle Peter
52:29 used the expression in verse 11,
52:31 “deeds of godly devotion.”
52:34 Well, what are some of the ways  that we demonstrate this quality?
52:38 Well, some of them are just very small.
52:40 For example, what about hospitality?
52:43 At 1 Peter 4:9,
52:47 when the apostle Peter  wrote his first letter, he said:
52:50 “Be hospitable  to one another without grumbling.”
52:54 Well, there are  so many opportunities
52:57 for us to imitate Jehovah  and be hospitable
53:00 —to share with others  according to their needs.
53:04 And this really is an expression  not only for another person
53:08 but it’s an expression  of our love for Jehovah
53:11 —our desire to want  to imitate him.
53:13 Well, we all acknowledge that.
53:15 But here’s the question:
53:17 When was the last time
53:20 that you acted hospitably?
53:23 Or when was the last time  I acted hospitably?
53:26 You see, it’s not enough just to love  the quality of hospitality.
53:30 If we are going  to have deeds of godly devotion,
53:33 we’re going to have to practice it.
53:35 Here’s another one.
53:37 What about helping the elderly  that are in our midst?
53:42 You know,  our elderly brothers need help.
53:44 They need help  to get to the meetings.
53:47 They need help  to get out in the field ministry.
53:50 Some of them  are confined to their homes.
53:52 Well, if that’s the case,  they may need help from younger ones
53:57 to assist them  with shopping or doing errands
54:00 or just doing  some chore around the house.
54:03 Well, that’s something  that has been mentioned
54:06 in many Watchtower articles.
54:08 It’s been mentioned  at many conventions and assemblies.
54:11 It’s been mentioned  at many congregation meetings.
54:15 But now here’s a question:
54:17 When was the last time
54:19 that you did something  for an elderly brother or sister?
54:22 Or when was the last time I did?
54:24 You see, we need to think
54:26 about not just loving these ideas
54:29 but what are we doing to really help?
54:32 See, that’s showing  deeds of godly devotion.
54:36 Well, of course, we also have to think  about the more major things.
54:40 What about attending  our congregation meetings?
54:44 Hebrews 10:23-25
54:47 —that scripture  that we quote so many times—
54:50 says that we should ‘not forsake  our meeting together.’
54:54 But it goes on to say  that we should ‘encourage one another.’
54:59 So it’s not enough  just to be at the meeting.
55:02 When we’re there, we want to reach out  and do everything that we can
55:06 to encourage our brothers  and really participate in the meeting.
55:10 You see, godly devotion  is not passive; it’s active.
55:15 And so, what sort of persons ought we to be  when we’re at the meeting?
55:19 Well, we know we want to be active,
55:22 fully involved with the program.
55:25 But now, of course,  what’s the most important way
55:28 that we exercise  these deeds of godly devotion?
55:31 Well, you’ll remember  that the apostle Paul
55:33 at 1 Timothy 3:16
55:37 referred to ‘the sacred secret  of godly devotion,’
55:41 and he showed there  that Jesus really was that secret.
55:46 You see, he was  the one who demonstrated
55:49 godly devotion  in a perfect sense.
55:52 Now, Paul in that verse,
1 Timothy 3:16,
55:56 went on to say that Jesus  was ‘preached among the nations.’
56:01 Well, then, that really is  a vital part
56:04 of our deeds of godly devotion
56:06 —preaching about Christ Jesus,  his Kingdom,
56:10 and everything  that will be accomplished.
56:12 But brothers,  how much incentive we have today
56:17 to be involved fully  in our preaching work.
56:20 We have tools today  like we have never had before.
56:24 You know, over the summer  as I was attending
56:27 a number of different regional conventions  in different parts of the world,
56:31 I enjoyed so much,  no doubt just as you have,
56:35 using the JW Library app
56:38 and downloading  the Why Study the Bible? video
56:42 in a number of different languages.
56:44 We had one real interesting experience  when we were in Europe.
56:48 We got into a taxi  with a driver from Africa.
56:52 And right away,  we asked him what his language was.
56:55 Well, he told us it was  a language not familiar to us at all.
56:58 But while he was driving,
57:01 we managed to download  the Why Study the Bible? video,
57:05 and it automatically  began to play as we were in the car.
57:09 Well, as soon as the man heard it,  he started shouting:
57:12 “What’s happening?  What’s happening?”
57:14 I think he thought  he was hearing a voice from heaven
57:17 when he heard  his own language in the taxi.
57:20 But we reassured him  that that was not the case.
57:23 But he was so moved.
57:25 He almost didn’t want to take the fare,  if you can imagine,
57:29 and initially  he had been quite unfriendly.
57:33 But when he saw  what was available on our website,
57:36 he was deeply moved.
57:38 Well, maybe  you’ve had a similar experience.
57:41 Just as a note of future reference:
57:43 It’s probably not a good idea  to play the video
57:45 when someone is driving.
57:47 Well, if we have  real godly devotion that’s active,
57:52 we’re going to be busy  in doing deeds of godly devotion.
57:56 You know,  there’s an old saying that says:
57:59 “Time flies when you’re having fun.”
58:02 Well, you know, even scientists  acknowledge that there’s truth in that.
58:06 A study that was published  in the year 2012
58:10 in the journal  Psychological Science said this:
58:14 Although we tend to believe
58:16 that time flies  when we’re having a good time,
58:20 these studies  indicate that what it is
58:23 about the enjoyable time  that causes it to go by more quickly.
58:27 It seems to be the goal pursuit
58:31 or achievement-directed action  we’re engaged in that matters.
58:36 Just being content or satisfied  may not make time fly,
58:40 but being excited or actively pursuing
58:44 a desired object can.
58:46 Isn’t that interesting?
58:48 Well, now, if we’re  the sort of persons that are busy
58:51 with holy acts of conduct  and deeds of godly devotion,
58:55 reaching out for that most important goal  of everlasting life,
59:00 we will speed up the coming  of the day of Jehovah
59:04 in our hearts and our minds.
59:07 What deeds of godly devotion
59:09 do you remember  from that fine presentation?
59:12 Among other things,  Brother Sanderson explained
59:15 that one deed of godly devotion  is to be hospitable to one another.
59:20 Hospitality is also the theme  of this month’s music video,
59:24 which is entitled  “Follow the Course [of Hospitality].”
59:37 It might be a meal or snacks or coffee Or fun and games, maybe just talking.
59:55 Jehovah is the one who put it on our table. So could we be able . . .
1:00:09 “Follow the course of hospitality.” Imitate God above.
1:00:17 Do it with true impartiality. That’s what it means to love.
1:00:37 The roof above our heads  is from our heavenly Father.
1:00:46 But if we need to share,  would it be a bother?
1:00:54 Let’s feel the joy  that only ever comes from giving!
1:01:03 That’s Christian living.
1:01:08 “Follow the course of hospitality.” Imitate God above.
1:01:18 Do it with true impartiality. That’s what it means to love.
1:01:36 Some people don’t have what we have. It’s up to us to share.
1:01:46 Disaster strikes, then they’re without. Will we really care?
1:01:55 Could we open up our home  and host a friend in need?
1:02:04 Do a kindly deed.
1:02:06 “Follow the course of hospitality.” Imitate God above.
1:02:17 Do it with true impartiality. That’s what it means to love.
1:02:26 That’s what it means to love. That’s what it means to love.
1:02:35 What a nice song!
1:02:37 And while that music video  brings this program to its conclusion,
1:02:41 we’d like to encourage you to watch a video
1:02:43 that will be posted later this month  about Sister Cindy McIntosh.
1:02:47 She was in the military for many years
1:02:50 and described herself as having become  a “dark and uncaring person.”
1:02:55 But then Jehovah taught her
1:02:57 what true love means.
1:03:00 The video is entitled I Put Down My Rifle  and is available on Video on Demand
1:03:04 in the “Interviews  and Experiences” category.
1:03:08 Yes, love truly is  the identifying mark of true Christians.
1:03:12 That’s what stands out  when you
1:03:14 visit other congregations,  perhaps when traveling.
1:03:17 One good example  is the Nong Khai Congregation
1:03:22 in the northeastern corner of Thailand.
1:03:25 The 32 publishers send their love.
1:03:28 There’s a great need in Thailand,
1:03:31 which is why half  of the 10 appointed brothers
1:03:33 in the congregation  and half of the 18 pioneers
1:03:37 are “need greaters.”
1:03:40 Witnessing carts have been set up  at a nearby border crossing,
1:03:43 with ten languages  regularly featured.
1:03:46 Many copies  are placed with visitors
1:03:48 from countries  where our work is restricted.
1:03:51 Sometimes over 1,000 pieces of literature
1:03:54 are placed in a single day  at the border crossing.
1:03:57 The Nong Khai Congregation  had the privilege
1:03:59 of being a host congregation  when a special convention
1:04:03 was arranged  in October of last year.
1:04:06 And during the convention,  they were surprised and overjoyed to hear
1:04:11 that the New World Translation  was now available
1:04:15 in the Thai language.
1:04:18 We pray that Jehovah continues to bless  the brothers and sisters in Thailand.
1:04:22 And all of you around the world,  we love you very much!

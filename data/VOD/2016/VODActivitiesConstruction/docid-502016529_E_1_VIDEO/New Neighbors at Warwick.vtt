00:01.188 --> 00:03.978
Moving the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


00:03.982 --> 00:05.992
out of Brooklyn, New York, 


00:05.985 --> 00:08.445
which has been there over a hundred years, 
and to take it upstate  


00:08.445 --> 00:12.195
into a rural setting, 
is a monumental task.


00:12.198 --> 00:14.198
From the first moment 


00:14.202 --> 00:17.542
that the Watchtower representatives 
came to the town, 


00:17.538 --> 00:21.628
they came with their concept 
and what they wanted to do. 


00:21.625 --> 00:24.585
I would say that they were 
very professional from day one. 


00:24.587 --> 00:27.587
They expressed a great willingness 
to be cooperative. 


00:27.590 --> 00:30.180
They wanted to understand our process, 
and they wanted us 


00:30.175 --> 00:32.295
to understand 
what they intended to do.


00:32.302 --> 00:33.552
When we come into a community, 


00:33.553 --> 00:35.183
we’re not developing 
something and moving on.


00:35.180 --> 00:37.310
We’re developing it 
to live and work in. 


00:37.307 --> 00:39.977
And so we want it to be also


00:39.977 --> 00:43.227
agreeable with the community 
and have their input on it.


00:43.230 --> 00:46.690
The location is surrounded 
by a pristine park 


00:46.692 --> 00:48.692
that’s been preserved. 


00:48.693 --> 00:50.993
And for them to go in there 
and clean that site up


00:50.988 --> 00:55.278
—remove the environmental issues—
to me is just a total home run 


00:55.283 --> 00:58.003
for not only the town of Warwick 
but the state of New York.


00:57.995 --> 01:00.785
The state forest 
was working with us 


01:00.788 --> 01:04.378
on what our facility
would look like from the hikers 


01:04.377 --> 01:06.247
and the trails 
and so forth around there. 


01:06.253 --> 01:09.593
And so early on, 
we did an exercise where we actually


01:09.590 --> 01:12.640
measured the tops of the buildings 
and put a balloon up there, 


01:12.635 --> 01:15.345
and then from the various trails 
in the area 


01:15.345 --> 01:17.765
could verify that they
would not be seen.


01:17.765 --> 01:22.095
Everything that our planning board 
asked for during the process


01:22.102 --> 01:25.652
was, you know, 
very readily given, 


01:25.647 --> 01:27.687
there were no complaints. 


01:27.692 --> 01:30.572
They said: “Yes, we want to do this right. 
We want to work with you.”


01:30.568 --> 01:32.988
And then good dialogue 
throughout the construction project, 


01:32.988 --> 01:34.988
especially the beginning phase, 


01:34.990 --> 01:37.370
helped us understand 
where we needed to adjust 


01:37.367 --> 01:39.447
and to accommodate 
our neighbors.


01:39.453 --> 01:42.873
My overall experience 
with Watchtower has been, 


01:42.873 --> 01:46.883
I guess, in one word: 
professionalism, attention to detail.


01:46.877 --> 01:48.707
They don’t cut any corners. 


01:48.712 --> 01:52.302
I mean, sometimes there are companies 
trying to save money here and there, 


01:52.298 --> 01:54.718
trying to cut a corner here and there. 


01:54.718 --> 01:58.968
And I’ve never witnessed anything like that, 
working with this organization.


01:58.972 --> 02:01.392
I’ve been here 
since the project started. 


02:01.392 --> 02:03.392
I’ve been here 
many times doing inspections. 


02:03.393 --> 02:06.063
I’ve never worked around so many 


02:06.063 --> 02:08.903
professional people 
who have the same goal.


02:08.898 --> 02:11.938
Any questions I had 
from reviewing the project 


02:11.943 --> 02:15.743
to doing the inspections 
just went so smoothly.


02:15.738 --> 02:20.118
Everyone is always on top 
of any situation that may arise. 


02:20.118 --> 02:22.118
There are 
always self-inspections 


02:22.120 --> 02:25.830
and just the tenacity 
to just keep going day after day, 


02:25.832 --> 02:29.672
you know, dedicated crews 
always to fix any problems that may arise. 


02:29.670 --> 02:32.170
I’ve really, actually, 
never had


02:32.172 --> 02:35.552
the opportunity to work 
with a more inviting group. 


02:35.550 --> 02:38.720
Every time I come by the site, 
it’s just a pleasure. 


02:38.720 --> 02:42.140
You know, you don’t really, 
you don’t get to have that experience 


02:42.140 --> 02:44.640
in construction all the time, 
so it’s refreshing, really.


02:44.643 --> 02:46.563
What was interesting 
about our project is 


02:46.562 --> 02:50.322
we had contractors and volunteers together
—men and women—


02:50.315 --> 02:52.685
and coming from different parts 
of the country.


02:52.693 --> 02:55.153
Most of the workforce 
here are volunteers, 


02:55.153 --> 02:58.743
but I find that term 
misleading because, 


02:58.740 --> 03:01.830
you know, everybody 
that I worked with was 


03:01.827 --> 03:04.577
completely professional 
and very well-trained.


03:04.580 --> 03:07.370
They’re so professional; 
it’s just wonderful. 


03:07.373 --> 03:10.883
I wish that all the projects were like this, 
to tell you the truth.


03:10.877 --> 03:13.297
Everybody was 
really courteous, polite, 


03:13.297 --> 03:15.837
and, you know, morale was 
at an all-time high here.


03:15.840 --> 03:18.840
Out of the 14-plus years 
that I have been with the planning board, 


03:18.843 --> 03:21.973
I’d have to say the best applicant 
to work with—bar none.


03:21.972 --> 03:24.272
Really, this organization 


03:24.265 --> 03:28.345
and this job site really are 
a testimony to how


03:28.353 --> 03:30.523
one’s spirituality, 
how important it is 


03:30.522 --> 03:34.002
to every day, 
you know, every aspect in life.


03:35.235 --> 03:38.815
We can really see 
that the community loves their area. 


03:38.822 --> 03:40.702
They love their town; 
they love their neighborhood; 


03:40.698 --> 03:42.488
they love their community.


03:42.492 --> 03:46.622
And it’s nice to work with people like that, 
because we too are good stewards of the land. 


03:46.622 --> 03:48.792
We too want to enjoy the community, 
want it to be safe 


03:48.790 --> 03:52.040
and not only environmentally 
but in other ways. 


03:52.043 --> 03:55.963
And so it’s really nice to see 
the devotion that these folks have 


03:55.963 --> 03:59.553
to having a good place 
for their families to live. 


03:59.552 --> 04:02.392
And we’re very excited 
to be a part of that community.


04:02.387 --> 04:06.057
We’re excited about the concept that this
is going to be the world headquarters.


04:06.057 --> 04:08.767
We understand that the members 


04:08.768 --> 04:13.568
of the Jehovah Witnesses
will be coming to visit the site. 


04:13.565 --> 04:16.935
It will be on their list 
of things to do, 


04:16.943 --> 04:20.283
which we find exciting.


04:20.280 --> 04:22.370
There are going to be thousands


04:22.365 --> 04:24.865
of visitors each year 
from around the world. 


04:24.868 --> 04:26.868
They’re going to be coming 
to see the facilities 


04:26.870 --> 04:29.870
and to see the community 
and the neighborhood that we live in.


04:29.873 --> 04:33.343
They’re regular folks that will also come 
to enjoy what we know 


04:33.335 --> 04:37.165
here in Warwick as just 
one of the most beautiful spots 


04:37.172 --> 04:39.382
in New York, 
and even in the United States. 


04:39.382 --> 04:41.842
We think that it’s going to be 
a great boost for our community. 


04:41.843 --> 04:44.953
We’re excited about it, 
and we welcome it.

00:07.235 --> 00:09.905
The blessings that I enjoy today 


00:09.905 --> 00:13.325
are so numerous.


00:13.325 --> 00:15.953
I have a true inner sense 


00:15.953 --> 00:18.538
of joy and happiness.


00:18.538 --> 00:21.750
I can’t help 
but be appreciative, 


00:21.750 --> 00:24.795
so grateful for 
all that Jehovah does.


00:24.795 --> 00:29.000
But it wasn’t 
always this way for us.


00:41.478 --> 00:46.000
It was a dark world growing up. 


00:48.152 --> 00:51.000
I never knew 
what being a child was like. 


00:54.198 --> 00:56.326
I was afraid 


00:56.327 --> 00:59.955
of who I would grow up to be. 


00:59.955 --> 01:04.167
I felt like I had no choice. 


01:04.167 --> 01:07.129
Then at a very young age, 
 I, as well, 


01:07.128 --> 01:09.088
started to partake of 


01:09.088 --> 01:11.341
what I saw going on around me. 


01:11.342 --> 01:14.595
I learned quickly that it helped numb 


01:14.595 --> 01:16.597
the feelings that I had. 


01:16.597 --> 01:19.934
Drugs were a way 
to escape that. 


01:19.933 --> 01:22.645
I was in a lot of trouble 
with the law. 


01:22.645 --> 01:25.313
I knew I needed change, 


01:25.313 --> 01:29.568
so I joined the military 
at a young age.


01:29.568 --> 01:34.323
Around my teenage years, 
my life became difficult. 


01:34.323 --> 01:38.826
I started to turn to drugs and alcohol 
and self-destructive ways, 


01:38.827 --> 01:42.665
but none of these things 
were making me happy. 


01:42.665 --> 01:45.167
I was very lonely. 


01:45.167 --> 01:49.212
No one knew me; 
no one cared to know me. 


01:49.212 --> 01:51.507
I felt so lost, 


01:51.507 --> 01:54.969
and I was trying 
to fill this big hole in my heart 


01:54.968 --> 01:57.805
with so many things,


01:57.805 --> 02:01.392
and none of it worked. 


02:01.392 --> 02:05.062
One of my many car accidents, 
due to drugs and alcohol, 


02:05.062 --> 02:09.190
ended me up in jail 


02:09.190 --> 02:13.000
for 30 days straight. 


02:15.197 --> 02:18.742
I felt like a hopeless mess. 


02:18.742 --> 02:23.247
I just knew 
something’s got to change. 


02:23.247 --> 02:25.290
So I joined the military, 


02:25.290 --> 02:27.375
thinking it was going to be 


02:27.375 --> 02:30.753
the positive great change 
that I needed, 


02:30.753 --> 02:34.508
but it was not.


02:34.508 --> 02:36.843
I remember 
joining the military 


02:36.843 --> 02:38.845
hoping that it 
would bring some sort 


02:38.845 --> 02:40.847
of authority into my life, 


02:40.847 --> 02:45.269
but I again started 
to spiral 


02:45.268 --> 02:49.481
into my anger,
my alcohol and drug abuse. 


02:49.482 --> 02:53.777
The military decided 
to let me out. 


02:53.777 --> 02:58.782
But during deployment 
is where I met Holly. 


02:58.782 --> 03:01.369
Holly also got 
out of the military, 


03:01.368 --> 03:04.036
and we started 
to live a life together.


03:04.037 --> 03:08.250
But we were still searching 
for something to fill 


03:08.250 --> 03:11.962
the emptiness 
that we both felt in our lives. 


03:11.962 --> 03:15.882
Jeremiah and I were both working 
in a steel factory in Montana. 


03:15.882 --> 03:20.554
During this time, 
I was being trained on a drill 


03:20.553 --> 03:23.098
by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
a sister named Molly. 


03:23.098 --> 03:25.558
Molly said, “You’re 
going to have down time


03:25.558 --> 03:28.353
“on this machine, 
maybe a couple of hours, 


03:28.353 --> 03:31.648
so feel free to read 
whatever I have in my tool box.” 


03:31.648 --> 03:33.650
I opened it 


03:33.650 --> 03:35.985
and immediately 
a little yellow book, 


03:35.985 --> 03:38.697
What Does the Bible Really Teach?, 
caught my eye. 


03:38.697 --> 03:40.699
I loved the pictures. 


03:40.698 --> 03:43.076
The scriptures 
at the beginning of the book, 


03:43.077 --> 03:46.789
they touched my heart immediately, 
and I felt like, 


03:46.788 --> 03:49.500
‘These answer all the questions 


03:49.500 --> 03:52.085
I’ve been searching 
for my entire life!’ 


03:52.085 --> 03:55.297
Another sister came over, 
her name was Cory, 


03:55.297 --> 03:57.549
and she said:
“Molly and I can come over, 


03:57.548 --> 03:59.968
“and we can talk to you 
about the Bible tomorrow. 


03:59.968 --> 04:03.555
If you have any questions, 
we’d love to answer them using the Bible.” 


04:03.555 --> 04:06.808
I said, “Yes, come over!”


04:06.808 --> 04:09.000
I was a little bit 
more apprehensive. 


04:11.313 --> 04:13.315
but this was finally 


04:13.315 --> 04:16.318
something very different. 


04:16.318 --> 04:19.111
And I realized what they were saying 
came from the Bible. 


04:19.112 --> 04:21.240
I’d never seen that before. 


04:21.240 --> 04:23.700
They invited us 
to the Kingdom Hall. 


04:23.700 --> 04:27.037
We went in, 
everybody had their Bible, 


04:27.037 --> 04:30.457
had time to look 
the scriptures up together, 


04:30.457 --> 04:33.294
and everybody was 
so warm and inviting.


04:33.293 --> 04:37.171
These were the people 
I’d been searching for my entire life.


04:37.172 --> 04:39.215
All of a sudden change 
was possible. 


04:39.215 --> 04:42.010
We knew what changes 
we needed to make in our life.


04:42.010 --> 04:44.220
What we were doing, 
our actions, 


04:44.220 --> 04:47.598
we had to clear out things 
that Jehovah hates.


04:47.598 --> 04:49.643
Like just going through 
our house and deciding 


04:49.643 --> 04:51.686
what it is 
that we need to get rid of. 


04:51.687 --> 04:54.355
By allowing the truth 
to transform our lives, 


04:54.355 --> 04:56.608
Holly and I’ve received 
many blessings, 


04:56.608 --> 05:01.155
and eventually we were able 
to come here together and serve at Bethel.


05:01.155 --> 05:03.782
We got the truth in a weld shop, 


05:03.782 --> 05:07.077
and now I get to weld 
here in Jehovah’s house for him.


05:07.077 --> 05:10.330
I perform maintenance 
on water fountains, 


05:10.330 --> 05:13.042
refrigerators, coolers. 


05:13.042 --> 05:16.127
Being trained by the brothers 
and sisters I work with 


05:16.127 --> 05:18.922
just helps me to refine 
my Christian personality.


05:18.922 --> 05:21.675
It’s so nice to know 
that Jehovah 


05:21.675 --> 05:23.927
is looking down on us; 


05:23.927 --> 05:26.305
that he was able 
to see through 


05:26.305 --> 05:28.807
all of the trash 
that was there in our life. 


05:28.807 --> 05:30.809
He was able to find something 


05:30.808 --> 05:32.810
and decided to work with it. 


05:32.810 --> 05:37.482
And I really think of a scripture, 
Psalm 145:19: 


05:37.482 --> 05:41.695
“He satisfies the desire 
of those 


05:41.695 --> 05:46.157
“who fear him; 
he hears their [cry] for help, 


05:46.157 --> 05:47.617
and [he] rescues them.” 


05:47.617 --> 05:49.452
Jehovah did that for us. 


05:49.452 --> 05:52.957
If you ask Jehovah 
to display his hand in your life, 


05:52.957 --> 05:55.625
no doubt at all in my mind, 


05:55.625 --> 06:11.580
that will happen.

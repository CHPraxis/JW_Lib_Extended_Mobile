00:02 So, if the Devil tempted Jesus,
00:06 don’t you think  he will try to tempt us
00:09 in order to jeopardize  our relationship with God?
00:13 This is the best contract  we’ve ever offered you.
00:15 Listen, I’ll get you a plan
00:17 so you can attend  your religious meetings during the week.
00:19 Just do the concert  for us on the weekend!
00:26 People always ask me,
00:28 “Why did you leave  the music world?”
00:31 When I was still a boy,
00:33 I had dreams  about becoming a famous singer.
00:38 Then I learned the truth,
00:40 but I never fully removed  those dreams from my heart.
00:44 And then I started listening  to some bad influences from my past,
00:49 and they got me hooked.
00:51 Then they reeled me  into the recording studio.
00:57 The lyrics in the songs
00:59 —they really bothered  my conscience.
01:03 So they offered me  some liquor to loosen me up,
01:06 and then I started  to feel more comfortable.
01:09 I started singing,  and they liked what they were hearing.
01:12 And those songs ended up  all over the radio stations.
01:16 It was as if Satan  gave me a trophy
01:18 for abandoning Jehovah.
01:21 I became addicted to the applause.
01:27 Everything looks so beautiful,
01:29 but when you’re on top
01:31 —when you’re really at the top  of Satan’s world—
01:34 there’s nothing beautiful there.
01:36 I was an actor,
01:38 and when the cameras  turned on,
01:39 my face and my smile  turned on too.
01:42 But when I would get back to the hotel,
01:44 it was a huge letdown.
01:46 There was no applause
01:48 —just that silence  that tormented my conscience.
01:55 So basically, you had to find
01:58 other distractions, and one of those for me
02:01 was the slot machine.
02:03 And, of course, casinos  don’t just come with slot machines.
02:07 They also expose you  to prostitution and alcohol.
02:10 My conscience would ask,
02:13 ‘What are you doing here?’
02:16 I remember those times on tour,
02:18 from my limousine,  I’d see the brothers preaching,
02:21 and that would always touch my heart.
02:24 I would say to myself, ‘Wow!
02:26 ‘Jehovah trained you  to be doing that,
02:28 and look at what you’re doing!’
02:30 That really cut deep into my heart.
02:33 The road back to the truth was,  really, very hard.
02:37 Every time I was going to retire,  I’d say, “This is it!”
02:41 But then there would always be  a bigger contract.
02:45 I had to make drastic decisions.
02:47 But finally I said:
02:49 “I don’t care what they offer me.
02:52 “I have to return to Jehovah.
02:54 “I have to fulfill the vow
02:56 “I made to him  when I was a young man,
02:59 when I dedicated my life to him.”
03:01 So I prayed to Jehovah  very earnestly and said:
03:05 “Jehovah,  I need to return to you.
03:07 “I need to return  to your loving arms.
03:10 “Satan has ripped me  away from you.
03:13 Please help me.”
03:16 I remember that before I went  in to that first meeting,
03:20 I told Jehovah, “Please give me a sign  that you will take me back.”
03:24 And there was  an elderly sister there.
03:27 She gave me a great big hug
03:29 and said, “Welcome back, son!”
03:32 And she took my hand
03:34 and sat by me  during the entire meeting.
03:37 I had betrayed Jehovah,  but I thank—
03:44 I thank the brothers
03:46 because Jehovah  put brothers at every turn.
03:50 They showed me with the Bible
03:53 how far I had strayed
03:55 from the paths of the true God,
03:57 and everything you do  has consequences.
04:01 I have asked Jehovah many times  to forgive me for all the things
04:04 I have done —and the brothers too—
04:06 all the people  I offended by my actions.
04:10 All those trophies I won
04:12 —every last one of them—
04:14 are there collecting dust.
04:16 But Jehovah has given me
04:18 a different kind of trophy  in his organization
04:20 —helping others to dedicate  their lives to him.
04:24 That’s something no one  can take away from you.
04:28 We don’t all  have to learn the hard way.
04:30 We have to keep enduring
04:32 and never turn  our backs on Jehovah.
04:35 That’s the worst mistake  anyone could make.
04:39 We know that it’s Jehovah  who gives us our talents,
04:43 so we should use them  all in his service.
04:46 I have found happiness,  and that gives me
04:50 a glow that’s not just  for the cameras.
04:53 Everyone who knows me  can see it.

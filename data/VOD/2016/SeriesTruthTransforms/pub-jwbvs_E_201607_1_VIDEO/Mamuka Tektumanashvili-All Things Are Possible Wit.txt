00:00 We recently met Mamuka Tektumanashvili,  from the country of Georgia.
00:05 He was a high-ranking officer  in the special forces there for many years.
00:10 What made him realize  that defending his country
00:14 is not the highest honor  a man can have in his life?
00:17 This is his story.
00:42 For 18 years  I served in a special unit
00:45 responsible  for presidential security.
00:48 This mission  demanded total self-sacrifice.
00:51 For example,  the first and the last vehicles
00:53 of the presidential escort  belonged to this unit.
00:56 So if an attack  occurred on the president,
00:58 we were the first ones  to be hit with the fire.
01:07 For the last ten years  of service, I worked
01:10 as an instructor  and trained new staff
01:12 to provide  presidential security in the future.
01:14 Those working in this field  must be fearless.
01:17 They must be professionals,
01:19 and that is what I taught  to succeeding generations.
01:27 I just loved my job.
01:29 I was a fervent patriot.
01:31 I had a special regard  for the flag of my country.
01:35 In one bag,  I always had weapons and the flag.
01:40 Patriotism  was so deep-rooted in me
01:42 that I would beat up a person
01:44 simply because he was  of another nationality.
01:49 I always thought  that God would never allow
01:51 people like me  to draw close to him.
01:54 One day, Jehovah’s Witnesses came  and preached to my wife and me.
01:58 We were so interested  in the truth that my wife
02:00 even expressed  a desire to study the Bible.
02:02 Because there were rumors  circulating about Jehovah’s Witnesses,
02:05 I decided first to make sure that everything was decent at their meetings
02:09 and only then allow my wife  to associate with them.
02:13 After the meeting,  I was absolutely thrilled.
02:15 Everyone was well-mannered,  with friendly, smiling faces.
02:19 I realized that there was nothing there  to threaten my wife’s well-being.
02:23 On the contrary, their association  would be beneficial for her.
02:27 Soon my wife  and our eldest daughter got baptized.
02:31 As for me, I enjoyed associating  with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:34 Later, I also started  to study the Bible.
02:37 I knew that I had to make  drastic changes in my life,
02:40 but my job  prevented me from doing so.
02:45 Moreover, I felt  that door-to-door preaching
02:47 was far more difficult  than engaging in combat.
02:50 I respected Jehovah’s Witnesses  for their courage and strength.
02:57 Little by little,  I too was changing for the better.
03:00 I wanted to quit my job and inform  my colleagues about my religious beliefs.
03:06 So I wrote down all the Bible verses  I had recently learned
03:10 and then pinned them  on the wall in my office.
03:15 I also started to think  about how to make a living
03:17 after leaving my job  and decided to learn a trade.
03:20 I started to buy tools  in order to be ready
03:23 to take care of my family.
03:25 I realized that the time  had come to make a decision.
03:31 The day I quit my job
03:33 was one of the happiest days  of my life.
03:36 Since then, I’ve been able  to dedicate every minute of my life
03:39 to Jehovah  with a clean conscience.
03:42 In a few months, I got baptized.
03:45 In the beginning,  we were hardly making a living.
03:48 However, this taught me  to trust in Jehovah.
03:51 I tried my best to keep  service to Jehovah in first place.
03:55 I deeply appreciate  the support of my brothers
03:57 and sisters  and association with them.
04:12 Before, I used to carry out  the orders of men
04:15 —some of which  I carried out reluctantly.
04:17 But now I am happy to carry out
04:19 an assignment from Jehovah  with the same spirit
04:22 that the prophet Isaiah had,  who said:
04:24 “Here I am! Send me!”
04:27 As a family, we decided to move  where the need was greater,
04:30 and this has united  our family even more.
04:36 This is the bag
04:37 in which  I always carried weapons,
04:39 but now they are replaced  with a Bible and Bible literature.
04:43 In the past, I thought
04:45 I could never preach  from door to door.
04:47 But now I can say with conviction
04:49 that the words of Jesus  have proved true in my case:
04:52 “All things are possible with God.”
05:01 Brother Tektumanashvili  now serves as an elder,
05:04 and he has also been  a regular pioneer since 2014.

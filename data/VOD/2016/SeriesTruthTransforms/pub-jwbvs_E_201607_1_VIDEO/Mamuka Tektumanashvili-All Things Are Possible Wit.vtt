00:00.917 --> 00:05.922
We recently met Mamuka Tektumanashvili, 
from the country of Georgia. 


00:05.922 --> 00:10.860
He was a high-ranking officer 
in the special forces there for many years. 


00:10.860 --> 00:14.597
What made him realize 
that defending his country 


00:14.597 --> 00:17.934
is not the highest honor 
a man can have in his life? 


00:17.933 --> 00:20.000
This is his story.


00:42.858 --> 00:45.661
For 18 years 
I served in a special unit 


00:45.662 --> 00:48.197
responsible 
for presidential security. 


00:48.197 --> 00:51.534
This mission 
demanded total self-sacrifice. 


00:51.533 --> 00:53.870
For example, 
the first and the last vehicles 


00:53.870 --> 00:56.538
of the presidential escort 
belonged to this unit. 


00:56.538 --> 00:58.808
So if an attack 
occurred on the president, 


00:58.808 --> 01:01.000
we were the first ones 
to be hit with the fire.


01:07.650 --> 01:10.220
For the last ten years 
of service, I worked 


01:10.220 --> 01:12.222
as an instructor 
and trained new staff 


01:12.222 --> 01:14.690
to provide 
presidential security in the future. 


01:14.690 --> 01:17.560
Those working in this field 
must be fearless. 


01:17.560 --> 01:19.562
They must be professionals, 


01:19.562 --> 01:22.000
and that is what I taught 
to succeeding generations.


01:27.303 --> 01:29.571
I just loved my job. 


01:29.572 --> 01:31.909
I was a fervent patriot. 


01:31.908 --> 01:35.211
I had a special regard 
for the flag of my country. 


01:35.212 --> 01:38.000
In one bag, 
I always had weapons and the flag. 


01:40.550 --> 01:42.618
Patriotism 
was so deep-rooted in me 


01:42.618 --> 01:44.620
that I would beat up a person 


01:44.620 --> 01:47.000
simply because he was 
of another nationality.


01:49.325 --> 01:51.327
I always thought 
that God would never allow


01:51.327 --> 01:54.330
people like me 
to draw close to him. 


01:54.330 --> 01:58.033
One day, Jehovah’s Witnesses came 
and preached to my wife and me. 


01:58.033 --> 02:00.101
We were so interested 
in the truth that my wife


02:00.102 --> 02:02.705
even expressed 
a desire to study the Bible. 


02:02.705 --> 02:05.975
Because there were rumors 
circulating about Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


02:05.975 --> 02:09.912
I decided first to make sure that everything
was decent at their meetings


02:09.912 --> 02:13.249
and only then allow my wife 
to associate with them. 


02:13.248 --> 02:15.251
After the meeting, 
I was absolutely thrilled. 


02:15.252 --> 02:19.255
Everyone was well-mannered, 
with friendly, smiling faces. 


02:19.255 --> 02:23.325
I realized that there was nothing there 
to threaten my wife’s well-being. 


02:23.325 --> 02:27.530
On the contrary, their association 
would be beneficial for her.


02:27.530 --> 02:31.267
Soon my wife 
and our eldest daughter got baptized. 


02:31.267 --> 02:34.804
As for me, I enjoyed associating 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


02:34.803 --> 02:37.540
Later, I also started 
to study the Bible. 


02:37.540 --> 02:40.943
I knew that I had to make 
drastic changes in my life, 


02:40.943 --> 02:43.000
but my job 
prevented me from doing so. 


02:45.013 --> 02:47.350
Moreover, I felt 
that door-to-door preaching 


02:47.350 --> 02:50.553
was far more difficult 
than engaging in combat. 


02:50.553 --> 02:55.000
I respected Jehovah’s Witnesses 
for their courage and strength.


02:57.027 --> 03:00.029
Little by little, 
I too was changing for the better. 


03:00.028 --> 03:05.000
I wanted to quit my job and inform 
my colleagues about my religious beliefs. 


03:06.970 --> 03:10.307
So I wrote down all the Bible verses 
I had recently learned 


03:10.307 --> 03:13.000
and then pinned them 
on the wall in my office.


03:15.010 --> 03:17.347
I also started to think 
about how to make a living 


03:17.347 --> 03:20.650
after leaving my job 
and decided to learn a trade. 


03:20.650 --> 03:23.418
I started to buy tools 
in order to be ready 


03:23.418 --> 03:25.688
to take care of my family. 


03:25.688 --> 03:28.000
I realized that the time 
had come to make a decision. 


03:31.093 --> 03:33.195
The day I quit my job 


03:33.195 --> 03:36.498
was one of the happiest days 
of my life. 


03:36.498 --> 03:39.435
Since then, I’ve been able 
to dedicate every minute of my life 


03:39.435 --> 03:42.105
to Jehovah 
with a clean conscience. 


03:42.105 --> 03:45.508
In a few months, I got baptized.


03:45.508 --> 03:48.711
In the beginning, 
we were hardly making a living. 


03:48.712 --> 03:51.514
However, this taught me 
to trust in Jehovah. 


03:51.513 --> 03:55.618
I tried my best to keep 
service to Jehovah in first place. 


03:55.618 --> 03:57.820
I deeply appreciate 
the support of my brothers 


03:57.820 --> 04:00.000
and sisters 
and association with them.


04:12.668 --> 04:15.305
Before, I used to carry out 
the orders of men


04:15.305 --> 04:17.773
—some of which 
I carried out reluctantly. 


04:17.773 --> 04:19.775
But now I am happy to carry out 


04:19.775 --> 04:22.245
an assignment from Jehovah 
with the same spirit 


04:22.245 --> 04:24.713
that the prophet Isaiah had, 
who said: 


04:24.713 --> 04:27.083
“Here I am! Send me!”


04:27.083 --> 04:30.820
As a family, we decided to move 
where the need was greater, 


04:30.820 --> 04:34.000
and this has united 
our family even more.


04:36.258 --> 04:37.293
This is the bag 


04:37.293 --> 04:39.495
in which 
I always carried weapons, 


04:39.495 --> 04:43.432
but now they are replaced 
with a Bible and Bible literature. 


04:43.432 --> 04:45.435
In the past, I thought 


04:45.435 --> 04:47.437
I could never preach 
from door to door. 


04:47.437 --> 04:49.539
But now I can say with conviction 


04:49.538 --> 04:52.675
that the words of Jesus 
have proved true in my case: 


04:52.675 --> 04:55.000
“All things are possible with God.”


05:01.817 --> 05:04.954
Brother Tektumanashvili 
now serves as an elder, 


05:04.953 --> 05:19.318
and he has also been 
a regular pioneer since 2014.

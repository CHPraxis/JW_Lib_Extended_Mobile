00:06.672 --> 00:10.885
Nurdup is a small island
about 10 to 15 minutes by boat 


00:10.885 --> 00:13.000
from the Panama mainland.


00:19.893 --> 00:22.313
Life on these islands is simple,


00:22.313 --> 00:25.733
though this one
in particular is special. 


00:25.733 --> 00:29.945
Even though the island
only has 24 inhabitants,


00:29.945 --> 00:33.365
7 of them, 
along with 5 from other islands, 


00:33.365 --> 00:35.910
attend the only congregation


00:35.910 --> 00:38.245
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the region. 


00:38.245 --> 00:40.665
Buna Tejada is one of them. 


00:40.665 --> 00:44.000
Though until very recently,
she could neither read nor write.


00:45.378 --> 00:47.796
I wanted to learn about the Bible,


00:47.797 --> 00:50.000
even though I didn’t know how to read. 


00:52.468 --> 00:55.180
My parents didn’t send me to school,


00:55.180 --> 00:58.000
but my brother taught me a little. 


01:00.727 --> 01:03.062
I felt that books spoke to people, 


01:03.062 --> 01:06.000
but to me they were speechless. 


01:07.067 --> 01:09.902
My teacher even said
that books could talk. 


01:09.902 --> 01:12.739
But I was never able to hear them.


01:12.738 --> 01:15.741
When I saw people 
going to the Kingdom Hall,


01:15.742 --> 01:18.454
I thought:
‘These meetings look good. 


01:18.453 --> 01:20.205
I should go too.’ 


01:20.205 --> 01:23.165
I knew that no one would say:
“Why are you here? 


01:23.165 --> 01:24.917
You won’t understand anything.” 


01:24.917 --> 01:27.670
That’s why I started
going to meetings, 


01:27.670 --> 01:29.713
and I’ve never stopped since. 


01:29.713 --> 01:32.008
Sometimes it’s difficult. 


01:32.008 --> 01:35.511
But I know if I miss a meeting,
I will feel bad. 


01:35.512 --> 01:40.000
So even if I can only listen,
I still go.


01:41.810 --> 01:44.270
Some people don’t like
to see you progressing. 


01:44.270 --> 01:48.107
They say, “Buna thinks she’s a man
—always with her books.” 


01:48.107 --> 01:51.402
Even one of my brothers,
who has since passed away,


01:51.402 --> 01:54.000
used to tell me the same. 


01:56.908 --> 02:01.000
At first, I felt ashamed
reading in front of others,


02:02.455 --> 02:04.873
and sometimes I still feel ashamed. 


02:04.873 --> 02:09.000
So I would wait until
I was alone at night before I read. 


02:10.630 --> 02:12.882
But I did not always understand. 


02:12.882 --> 02:14.759
I needed someone to help me


02:14.758 --> 02:18.000
—to encourage me and explain
what I was reading.


02:19.555 --> 02:21.182
At first,


02:21.182 --> 02:24.560
there was only material in Spanish,
so that’s all I had. 


02:24.560 --> 02:26.353
I don’t speak Spanish. 


02:26.353 --> 02:28.355
So I didn’t understand anything, 


02:28.355 --> 02:32.110
and nobody could explain to me
in Guna what was written. 


02:32.110 --> 02:34.000
It was like a secret.


02:35.863 --> 02:39.158
I really appreciate
what I’ve learned about Jehovah. 


02:39.158 --> 02:43.000
If I didn’t know about him,
I would be like everyone else. 


02:44.288 --> 02:49.000
Studying the Bible has helped me
to understand right from wrong.


02:53.380 --> 02:55.383
When the videos are in Guna,


02:55.383 --> 02:58.000
I can understand them very well. 


02:59.303 --> 03:01.513
I love that the videos encourage


03:01.513 --> 03:04.000
Guna speakers
to attend the meetings.


03:08.813 --> 03:12.316
I have seen that preaching
from door to door makes you happy. 


03:12.317 --> 03:13.777
When I think about it,


03:13.777 --> 03:16.820
I would like to be able
to preach more freely, like others do. 


03:16.820 --> 03:19.407
But we’re very isolated here, 


03:19.407 --> 03:22.000
and it is hard to leave this island.


03:24.912 --> 03:26.915
When I see pictures of the Paradise,


03:26.915 --> 03:28.207
I want to be there. 


03:28.207 --> 03:31.000
I want to survive and live there. 


03:32.115 --> 03:34.838
In the future,
the earth will be a paradise. 


03:34.838 --> 03:37.000
There is no doubt at all! 


03:38.593 --> 03:40.720
This motivates me to learn more. 


03:40.720 --> 03:43.347
I really want it to reach my heart.


03:43.347 --> 03:45.809
Thanks to the efforts of our brothers


03:45.808 --> 03:50.271
in translation offices, 
even those with little or no education


03:50.272 --> 03:52.190
can grasp Bible truths


03:52.190 --> 03:54.942
and come to know God.


03:54.942 --> 03:58.000
Jehovah’s organization
cares for us all,


03:59.447 --> 04:02.000
even the little ones.


04:04.327 --> 04:07.455
I want to be among
those taught by Jehovah


04:07.455 --> 04:09.457
and this organization. 


04:09.457 --> 04:11.167
By the work they do,


04:11.167 --> 04:13.837
I can see that Jehovah cares


04:13.837 --> 04:30.770
—even for me.

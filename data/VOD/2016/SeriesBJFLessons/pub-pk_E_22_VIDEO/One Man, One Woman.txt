00:19 Look, Mom!
00:21 I drew our family  in school today!
00:23 Oh, wow!
00:25 I didn’t have time  to finish Caleb’s face.
00:28 Carrie drew two mommies.
00:30 She told me  they’re married to each other.
00:32 My teacher says  that all that matters
00:34 is that people love each other  and that they’re happy.
00:36 Hmm.
00:38 Well, people have their own ideas  about what is right and wrong,
00:41 but what matters  is how Jehovah feels.
00:44 He wants us to be happy,  and he knows how we can be happiest!
00:48 That’s why he invented marriage  the way he did.
00:51 You mean one man  and one woman?
00:53 Exactly!  Look at Genesis 1:27.
00:56 Jehovah created Adam and Eve,  male and female.
01:00 Then in Genesis 2:24 he said
01:03 that “a man  will . . . stick to his wife.”
01:06 Later, Jesus said the same thing!
01:09 Jehovah’s standards  haven’t changed.
01:13 It’s kind of like  going on an airplane.
01:15 What would happen  if someone wanted to bring
01:17 something on the plane  that wasn’t allowed?
01:19 They couldn’t go on their trip!
01:21 Right!  It’s the same with Jehovah.
01:24 He wants us to be his friend  and live in Paradise forever!
01:29 But we have to follow  his standards to get there.
01:32 At Matthew 7:13, 14 it talks  about the road leading to Paradise.
01:37 To get there, Jehovah says  we have to leave some things behind.
01:41 That means anything  Jehovah doesn’t approve of.
01:48 But I want everyone  to get to Paradise!
01:50 So does Jehovah!  And you know what?
01:53 People can change!
01:55 That’s why  we share his message.
01:57 So, what can you say  to Carrie?
02:00 Well, I can tell her  about the Paradise.
02:03 I can tell her about the animals  and the resurrection!
02:06 That’s awesome!  Let’s practice.

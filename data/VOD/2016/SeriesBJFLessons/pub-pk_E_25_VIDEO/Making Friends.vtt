Sister Elsa,

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you paint these?

00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:33.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did.

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:34.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re amazing! 

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:36.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long
have you been drawing?

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:39.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as I can remember. 

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s my way
of being able to share

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the stories of my life.

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:46.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you show me?

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:48.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, of course!

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember a time when I was young
and in East Germany. 

00:00:51.937 --> 00:00:55.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t allowed to do our work
as Jehovah’s Witnesses;

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:57.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were under ban.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
I helped in copying
our <i>Watchtower </i>magazines by hand

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then hiding them in food.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did?

00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:05.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes! 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d then send the food
to our brothers who were in prison.

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:13.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was also asked to help
in distributing Bible literature

00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:17.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our congregations 
as an underground messenger.

00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:18.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:22.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time passed and then things 
started getting better in Berlin.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:26.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after, 
I immigrated to New York. 

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:30.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I met my darling husband.

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow, that was a great story!

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:35.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you. 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m sure you have stories. 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you like to draw?

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:43.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, actually, here! 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the time
when Caleb and I went to the park,

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:48.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we met a little girl there.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad I reached out that day. 

00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:54.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lasting friends can be of any age
when they love Jehovah.

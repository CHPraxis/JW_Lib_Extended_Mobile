00:14.997 --> 00:23.740
How does it make you feel
when you preach and teach with zeal,


00:23.740 --> 00:32.000
When you know you’ve done your part
to reach an honest heart?


00:33.550 --> 00:42.358
Knowing you’ve done your best;
then our God will do the rest.


00:42.358 --> 00:50.800
Honest hearts he surely knows—
all those to him disposed.


00:50.800 --> 01:00.710
It makes us glad, and we rejoice
to give our heart and mind and voice.


01:00.710 --> 01:08.000
So may our sacrifice of praise
continue all our days.


01:15.625 --> 01:24.233
How does it make you feel
when the words you speak appeal


01:24.233 --> 01:33.000
To the ones whose heart is right
for everlasting life?


01:34.110 --> 01:42.785
Some people turn away,
others might be led astray.


01:42.785 --> 01:51.828
Still we’re glad to bear his name
and witness just the same.


01:51.828 --> 02:01.336
It makes us glad, and we rejoice
to give our heart and mind and voice.


02:01.337 --> 02:09.000
So may our sacrifice of praise
continue all our days.


02:16.185 --> 02:24.927
How does it make you feel,
knowing God’s support is real,


02:24.927 --> 02:34.304
And that he’s entrusted you
to do the work we do?


02:34.303 --> 02:43.478
Proudly we preach and teach,
using bold but gracious speech,


02:43.478 --> 02:52.355
Searching out deserving ones;
this work will soon be done.


02:52.355 --> 03:02.065
It makes us glad, and we rejoice
to give our heart and mind and voice.


03:02.065 --> 03:20.667
So may our sacrifice of praise
continue all our days.

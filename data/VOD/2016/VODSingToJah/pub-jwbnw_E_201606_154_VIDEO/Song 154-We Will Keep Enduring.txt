00:17 How can we endure When trials come, as Jesus said?
00:29 Through his pain he saw The joy of better things ahead.
00:40 God’s promise, God’s justice, Were thoughts on which he fed.
00:51 We need to have endurance. Our faith we must defend.
01:02 His love is our assurance. So we will keep enduring to the end.
01:21 Though the passing years May bring us sorrow, bring us pain;
01:32 There beyond the tears, We see the life that we can gain.
01:44 To be there, feel free there, Determined we remain.
01:55 We need to have endurance. Our faith we must defend.
02:07 His love is our assurance. So we will keep enduring to the end.
02:25 We will not give up Nor see the need for doubt or fear.
02:36 Faithfully we’ll serve Until Jehovah’s day is here.
02:47 Let’s keep on enduring. That time is very near.
02:58 We need to have endurance. Our faith we must defend.
03:10 His love is our assurance. So we will keep enduring to the end.

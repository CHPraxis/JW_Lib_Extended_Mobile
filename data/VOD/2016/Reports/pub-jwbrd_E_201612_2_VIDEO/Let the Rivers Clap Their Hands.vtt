00:12.262 --> 00:14.564
It was very difficult 
to reach these territories 


00:14.563 --> 00:17.933
because we had to navigate 
through part of the Orinoco 


00:17.933 --> 00:21.070
and then onto other smaller rivers. 


00:21.070 --> 00:24.373
Many of their communities are far away.


00:24.373 --> 00:28.243
The first time we came, 
we traveled on the roof of a boat. 


00:28.243 --> 00:32.148
We are within days 
(approximately seven days) 


00:32.148 --> 00:36.618
from our place of origin, 
where our family is. 


00:36.618 --> 00:40.056
Another challenge is the language. 


00:40.057 --> 00:42.959
We realized that many 
did not understand a word. 


00:42.958 --> 00:45.228
In this assignment, 


00:45.228 --> 00:48.063
we have come across 
seven different languages. 


00:48.063 --> 00:51.000
Initially, this was a demanding task. 


00:52.402 --> 00:56.807
Imagine having so much to say 
and not being understood. 


00:56.807 --> 01:00.910
We were able to overcome it 
because, at this point, 


01:00.910 --> 01:04.647
we feel that what we preach in their language
—it is reaching their hearts.


01:04.647 --> 01:06.049
They understand.


01:06.048 --> 01:06.983
They understand.


01:06.983 --> 01:07.983
We can see it in their faces.


01:07.983 --> 01:10.000
And that motivates them 
to make changes in their life.


01:11.822 --> 01:14.190
This led a group of brothers 
to put forward


01:14.190 --> 01:16.993
the idea of having our own boat
for the purpose 


01:16.993 --> 01:20.000
of preaching the good news 
of the Kingdom in this area. 


01:22.165 --> 01:25.535
And that’s when finally the project 


01:25.535 --> 01:30.273
of El Precursor del Amazonas was born. 


01:30.273 --> 01:34.476
The branch arranged 
for a committee to handle 


01:34.477 --> 01:38.380
the task of managing 
and caring for the boat. 


01:38.380 --> 01:42.785
They also prepare 
the travel itinerary during the year. 


01:42.785 --> 01:45.555
They conduct important meetings, 


01:45.555 --> 01:48.023
such as the pre-departure meeting


01:48.023 --> 01:51.293
—which aims to train 
the assigned passengers, 


01:51.293 --> 01:54.796
giving them necessary 
guidelines and instructions


01:54.797 --> 01:57.034
to be observed during the trip. 


01:57.033 --> 02:01.270
They also assign 
the different crews to man the boat.


02:01.270 --> 02:05.175
In the morning, 
you get up before dawn


02:05.175 --> 02:08.678
—most likely six in the morning,


02:08.678 --> 02:10.713
half past five. 


02:10.713 --> 02:13.950
It’s still a little dark. 


02:13.950 --> 02:18.955
Morning worship is conducted 
at approximately seven o’clock; 


02:18.955 --> 02:23.927
some instructions are given; 
and after offering up a prayer, 


02:23.927 --> 02:27.000
we eat calmly 
at about half past seven.


02:28.665 --> 02:31.067
During the trip, 
there’s a chance to read. 


02:31.067 --> 02:34.137
There are assignments, 
such as cleaning the boat, cooking. 


02:34.137 --> 02:37.340
Actually, we stay pretty busy. 


02:37.340 --> 02:40.843
And at the end of the day, 
we arrive at a beach or a community.


02:40.843 --> 02:43.980
No comparison 
between traveling before and traveling now.


02:43.980 --> 02:46.015
Now we travel by limousine. 


02:46.015 --> 02:49.652
It’s luxurious
—“five star” or something like that.


02:49.652 --> 02:51.654
Yes, 


02:51.653 --> 02:54.656
traveling in seats, for example, 


02:54.657 --> 02:57.660
with a group of brothers, 


02:57.660 --> 03:00.463
with a formal meal service, 


03:00.463 --> 03:02.598
with electricity.


03:02.598 --> 03:04.833
Meetings are held; 
we consider the daily text. 


03:04.833 --> 03:08.000
We share experiences, 
tell stories; we do everything!


03:09.172 --> 03:12.042
It’s like being in a miniature Kingdom Hall, 


03:12.042 --> 03:14.510
traveling for five days. 


03:14.510 --> 03:16.980
We also preach 
in the different communities along the way. 


03:16.980 --> 03:20.783
It has its own publications 
and a literature cart. 


03:20.783 --> 03:23.720
That makes it a very spiritual 


03:23.720 --> 03:26.000
and upbuilding experience for all of us.


03:27.390 --> 03:29.758
The way the boat looked to them, 


03:29.758 --> 03:32.228
captured the indigenous peoples’ interest. 


03:32.228 --> 03:34.396
The dignified presentation 
of the boat 


03:34.397 --> 03:37.434
is something worthy 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


03:37.433 --> 03:40.101
I also noticed that 
where we were sitting, 


03:40.102 --> 03:43.272
we had a little area, 
like a locker for each person. 


03:43.272 --> 03:45.609
That made it very comfortable


03:45.608 --> 03:48.945
—things that didn’t exist in boats for rent. 


03:48.945 --> 03:53.215
El Precursor del Amazonas 
has been a blessing for us.


03:53.215 --> 03:56.685
We were able to bring our food 
and some of the things we needed, 


03:56.685 --> 03:59.155
such as a refrigerator to keep it in. 


03:59.155 --> 04:01.157
Those things have been made possible, 


04:01.157 --> 04:03.994
thanks to Jehovah, 
who allowed us to have this boat.


04:03.993 --> 04:07.230
At times, 
we have arrived at a point where 


04:07.230 --> 04:09.398
we nearly run out of all the supplies, 


04:09.398 --> 04:12.568
and something always happens
—brothers arrive 


04:12.568 --> 04:15.905
or El Precursor del Amazonas comes. 


04:15.905 --> 04:18.073
At the end, 
we learned to be in want 


04:18.073 --> 04:20.075
but also to have 
an abundance. 


04:20.075 --> 04:23.012
Seeing all this 
makes us feel protected


04:23.012 --> 04:25.449
—even though we are here 
in the middle of the jungle.


04:25.448 --> 04:29.585
People here in Amazonas 
know that there is a God 


04:29.585 --> 04:32.622
who gives them food, 
provides them the river, 


04:32.622 --> 04:34.624
gives them the rain 
that keeps them alive. 


04:34.623 --> 04:36.625
But they didn’t know 


04:36.625 --> 04:38.628
that Jehovah is that God. 


04:38.628 --> 04:40.630
And that is our job


04:40.630 --> 04:43.498
—to teach these people 
that Jehovah is the true God.


04:43.498 --> 04:45.501
When you see the sparkle 


04:45.502 --> 04:48.839
in the eyes of your Bible students 
when they understand the truth, 


04:48.838 --> 04:50.840
there is nothing like it. 


04:50.840 --> 04:53.042
It compensates for any discomfort. 


04:53.042 --> 04:55.044
That’s priceless! 


04:55.043 --> 04:57.246
So being in this work 
is the best thing you can do 


04:57.247 --> 05:00.049
because it causes true happiness.


05:00.048 --> 05:04.386
I am proud 
of being with Jehovah’s people. 


05:04.387 --> 05:08.090
Now I enjoy watching the videos 
with my family. 


05:08.090 --> 05:11.493
I conduct a family study, 
and I preach with my children, 


05:11.493 --> 05:15.130
giving the message 
to the people.


05:15.130 --> 05:18.968
Sometimes you have to reject Bible studies
—something that seems a strange thing 


05:18.968 --> 05:22.171
for a Jehovah’s Witness to do, 
turn down Bible studies. 


05:22.172 --> 05:24.207
Rather, we always want 
to have studies. 


05:24.207 --> 05:26.209
But there are so many 


05:26.208 --> 05:28.945
that if we start giving them all, 
it will be impossible. 


05:28.945 --> 05:31.680
So, then, sometimes we choose 
to tell people to wait a bit 


05:31.680 --> 05:34.017
and that we’ll return 
on another occasion. 


05:34.017 --> 05:36.752
And sometimes 
up to one year will pass by. 


05:36.752 --> 05:39.089
We have visited people 
from a year ago 


05:39.088 --> 05:41.423
that had not been spoken to since, 
and they say: 


05:41.423 --> 05:44.960
“Hey, a year ago you said you’d return, 
and now here you are. 


05:44.960 --> 05:47.000
But it’s been a year, brother!”


05:48.932 --> 05:51.034
I feel good, 


05:51.033 --> 05:53.068
and I am teaching them in Curripaco. 


05:53.068 --> 05:57.000
So they can speak to people 
about Jehovah in Curripaco.


05:58.373 --> 06:01.310
To share in one of the preaching trips 


06:01.310 --> 06:04.380
of El Precursor del Amazonas 


06:04.380 --> 06:07.217
is a unique and unforgettable experience. 


06:07.217 --> 06:10.285
Your faith is strengthened when you return, 


06:10.285 --> 06:12.488
and you are made more aware of the need 


06:12.488 --> 06:45.971
for additional workers for the harvest.

00:12 It was very difficult  to reach these territories
00:14 because we had to navigate  through part of the Orinoco
00:17 and then onto other smaller rivers.
00:21 Many of their communities are far away.
00:24 The first time we came,  we traveled on the roof of a boat.
00:28 We are within days  (approximately seven days)
00:32 from our place of origin,  where our family is.
00:36 Another challenge is the language.
00:40 We realized that many  did not understand a word.
00:42 In this assignment,
00:45 we have come across  seven different languages.
00:48 Initially, this was a demanding task.
00:52 Imagine having so much to say  and not being understood.
00:56 We were able to overcome it  because, at this point,
01:00 we feel that what we preach in their language —it is reaching their hearts.
01:04 They understand.
01:06 They understand.
01:06 We can see it in their faces.
01:07 And that motivates them  to make changes in their life.
01:11 This led a group of brothers  to put forward
01:14 the idea of having our own boat for the purpose
01:16 of preaching the good news  of the Kingdom in this area.
01:22 And that’s when finally the project
01:25 of El Precursor del Amazonas was born.
01:30 The branch arranged  for a committee to handle
01:34 the task of managing  and caring for the boat.
01:38 They also prepare  the travel itinerary during the year.
01:42 They conduct important meetings,
01:45 such as the pre-departure meeting
01:48 —which aims to train  the assigned passengers,
01:51 giving them necessary  guidelines and instructions
01:54 to be observed during the trip.
01:57 They also assign  the different crews to man the boat.
02:01 In the morning,  you get up before dawn
02:05 —most likely six in the morning,
02:08 half past five.
02:10 It’s still a little dark.
02:13 Morning worship is conducted  at approximately seven o’clock;
02:18 some instructions are given;  and after offering up a prayer,
02:23 we eat calmly  at about half past seven.
02:28 During the trip,  there’s a chance to read.
02:31 There are assignments,  such as cleaning the boat, cooking.
02:34 Actually, we stay pretty busy.
02:37 And at the end of the day,  we arrive at a beach or a community.
02:40 No comparison  between traveling before and traveling now.
02:43 Now we travel by limousine.
02:46 It’s luxurious —“five star” or something like that.
02:49 Yes,
02:51 traveling in seats, for example,
02:54 with a group of brothers,
02:57 with a formal meal service,
03:00 with electricity.
03:02 Meetings are held;  we consider the daily text.
03:04 We share experiences,  tell stories; we do everything!
03:09 It’s like being in a miniature Kingdom Hall,
03:12 traveling for five days.
03:14 We also preach  in the different communities along the way.
03:16 It has its own publications  and a literature cart.
03:20 That makes it a very spiritual
03:23 and upbuilding experience for all of us.
03:27 The way the boat looked to them,
03:29 captured the indigenous peoples’ interest.
03:32 The dignified presentation  of the boat
03:34 is something worthy  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:37 I also noticed that  where we were sitting,
03:40 we had a little area,  like a locker for each person.
03:43 That made it very comfortable
03:45 —things that didn’t exist in boats for rent.
03:48 El Precursor del Amazonas  has been a blessing for us.
03:53 We were able to bring our food  and some of the things we needed,
03:56 such as a refrigerator to keep it in.
03:59 Those things have been made possible,
04:01 thanks to Jehovah,  who allowed us to have this boat.
04:03 At times,  we have arrived at a point where
04:07 we nearly run out of all the supplies,
04:09 and something always happens —brothers arrive
04:12 or El Precursor del Amazonas comes.
04:15 At the end,  we learned to be in want
04:18 but also to have  an abundance.
04:20 Seeing all this  makes us feel protected
04:23 —even though we are here  in the middle of the jungle.
04:25 People here in Amazonas  know that there is a God
04:29 who gives them food,  provides them the river,
04:32 gives them the rain  that keeps them alive.
04:34 But they didn’t know
04:36 that Jehovah is that God.
04:38 And that is our job
04:40 —to teach these people  that Jehovah is the true God.
04:43 When you see the sparkle
04:45 in the eyes of your Bible students  when they understand the truth,
04:48 there is nothing like it.
04:50 It compensates for any discomfort.
04:53 That’s priceless!
04:55 So being in this work  is the best thing you can do
04:57 because it causes true happiness.
05:00 I am proud  of being with Jehovah’s people.
05:04 Now I enjoy watching the videos  with my family.
05:08 I conduct a family study,  and I preach with my children,
05:11 giving the message  to the people.
05:15 Sometimes you have to reject Bible studies —something that seems a strange thing
05:18 for a Jehovah’s Witness to do,  turn down Bible studies.
05:22 Rather, we always want  to have studies.
05:24 But there are so many
05:26 that if we start giving them all,  it will be impossible.
05:28 So, then, sometimes we choose  to tell people to wait a bit
05:31 and that we’ll return  on another occasion.
05:34 And sometimes  up to one year will pass by.
05:36 We have visited people  from a year ago
05:39 that had not been spoken to since,  and they say:
05:41 “Hey, a year ago you said you’d return,  and now here you are.
05:44 But it’s been a year, brother!”
05:48 I feel good,
05:51 and I am teaching them in Curripaco.
05:53 So they can speak to people  about Jehovah in Curripaco.
05:58 To share in one of the preaching trips
06:01 of El Precursor del Amazonas
06:04 is a unique and unforgettable experience.
06:07 Your faith is strengthened when you return,
06:10 and you are made more aware of the need
06:12 for additional workers for the harvest.

00:06 We’ve come  to our principal talk
00:09 for this 141st class of Gilead,
00:15 the graduation.
00:18 And we’re going to invite  Brother Gerrit Lösch now.
00:22 I thought you’d find this interesting.
00:25 This is the 141st class.
00:28 We’ve heard that throughout  the morning.
00:31 Well, 100 classes ago,
00:39 Brother Lösch was graduating  from the 41st class.
00:44 And I don’t know if heaven did it,
00:46 but we had an Austrian in each one of those.
00:49 So that’s very nice.
00:52 And I don’t want to say anything,  but he is getting a little older,
00:55 but he still looks great, doesn’t he?
00:58 Because he knew the sister in this class
01:01 when she was just a tiny little girl.
01:04 So very nice.
01:06 And Brother Lösch gave me that information;  so it’s bona fide.
01:12 So Brother Lösch is going to speak
01:14 on the theme  “Make Good Use of Your Time.”
01:20 What’s the time? Well, anyway, it’s time to start.
01:25 There are certain things of which the richest
01:28 and the poorest person on earth have the same:
01:32 number one, life; second, two parents;
01:37 third, free will;
01:40 and fourth, time.
01:44 Poor and rich all have 24 hours a day.
01:48 Therefore, it’s not quite correct to say
01:51 one has “no time” or “plenty of time.”
01:54 All have the same—24 hours.
01:57 The word “time” is  an integral part of our vocabulary.
02:01 What is time?
02:03 Some say, “Time is money.”
02:07 If we make decisions, “time will tell” whether they are good ones.
02:12 In the world, some make wrong decisions and then,
02:16 therefore, they have to “do time” in prison.
02:21 When driving a car, we may “make good time,”
02:24 although from “time to time,” we may stop and have a snack.
02:29 We are “taking our time” if we do not hurry.
02:34 We may still arrive “on time” or even “ahead of time”
02:39 if we “time it right.”
02:41 But “at times,” we may still be late,
02:45 especially if our “timing” was poor,
02:47 which may not be “all the time,” just “from time to time.”
02:54 After we arrive at our destination,
02:56 the “time has arrived”  to have a “good time.”
03:02 But on a more serious note,
03:04 how does the Bible use the term “time”?
03:08 Ecclesiastes 3:1 says:
03:11 ‘There is an appointed time for everything,
03:14 ‘a time for every activity under the heavens:
03:17 ‘for birth and for death;
03:20 ‘to plant, to uproot;
03:23 ‘to tear down, to build up;
03:26 ‘to weep and to laugh;
03:29 ‘to wail and to dance;
03:32 a time to keep and a time to throw away,’
03:36 like when we have to move  to another complex.
03:40 It is now  the “acceptable time” to preach
03:44 because “the appointed times of the nations”
03:47 are over and we are living in “the time of the end.”
03:53 Therefore, we should be zealous
03:55 in line with the urgency of times.
03:58 Jehovah blesses the work and said that he
04:01 “will speed it up in its own time.”
04:05 The Greek adjective ai·oʹni·os can,
04:08 as is evident from the context,
04:10 signify both “long lasting” and “everlasting.”
04:16 From the first man, Adam,
04:18 forward, time has been measured in terms of years.
04:21 Thus, Adam was 130 years old
04:25 when he became father to Seth.
04:29 Monthly divisions  also came into use.
04:32 By the time of the Flood, we find time divided
04:35 into months of 30 days,
04:39 and a period of five months
04:41 is shown in the Bible to equal 150 days.
04:45 The same record
04:47 also indicates that Noah divided the year into 12 months.
04:52 To track time, a calendar is used for dividing time
04:57 into years, months, weeks, and days.
05:01 The world’s oldest calendar
05:03 was discovered in a Scottish field
05:07 at Warren Field,
05:09 according to BBC News from the year 2013
05:14 and National Geographic of July 15, 2013.
05:19 It was excavated first in the year 2004 only.
05:25 To track time during the day, also, sundials were invented.
05:29 They are considered the first
05:31 time-measuring devices known to man.
05:34 Dating to the 19th dynasty,
05:37 or the 13th century before our Common Era,
05:41 a few years ago, a sundial was found
05:44 on the floor of a workman’s hut
05:47 in the Valley of Kings,
05:50 the burial place of rulers from Egypt.
05:55 In 1675, King Charles II of England
06:00 commissioned that a small observatory
06:03 be constructed in what is now
06:05 the London borough of Greenwich
06:08 in order to find out  the longitude of places
06:12 for perfecting navigation and astronomy.
06:17 Two newly invented timepieces
06:19 with pendulums 13 feet, or 4 meters, long
06:23 were installed to make accurate calculations
06:26 of the earth’s rotation.
06:29 Noon Greenwich Mean Time is the moment
06:33 when the sun reaches its zenith over any point
06:37 on the Greenwich longitude line,  or meridian,
06:41 from Latin meridianus, of midday.
06:46 Based on this Latin word, time before noon
06:49 came to be known as ante meridiem,
06:52 or before midday;
06:54 and time after noon
06:56 came to be known as post meridiem,
07:00 or p.m., as we call it.
07:05 Today, time is measured for accuracy with atomic clocks.
07:09 They are regulated by atomic vibrations
07:12 and are accurate to one second in 80 million years
07:18 —very accurate.
07:21 Again, what is time?
07:23 You have heard the saying
07:25 “as time goes by”
07:28 or “time flies,”
07:32 but this is Scripturally not quite correct.
07:36 Time does not go or walk or fly
07:41 —we fly.
07:43 And this is supported at Psalm 90:10,
07:49 where Moses wrote this psalm, not David.
07:54 And it says in verse 10:
07:57 “The span of our life is 70 years,
08:00 “or 80 if one is especially strong.
08:03 “But they are filled with trouble and sorrow;
08:06 “they quickly pass by,
08:08 and away we fly”
08:12 —not the time.
08:14 When a man dies,
08:16 time is still there and hasn’t flown anywhere.
08:21 Again, what is time?
08:24 Twelve o’clock noon in New York
08:26 is twelve o’clock midnight in Mongolia.
08:32 When you cross the date line westbound,
08:35 suddenly you have lost a day, seemingly.
08:37 But did you really lose a day? No.
08:41 It’s just the perception.
08:43 To the contrary,
08:45 when you come from Japan to the United States,
08:48 you seem to gain a day
08:50 crossing the date line eastbound.
08:53 But does this change the reality of time? No.
08:57 You have not become a day younger. Sorry.
09:03 What’s the time on North Pole, exactly on North Pole?
09:08 If you stay on the North Pole, does time move on?
09:13 Something to think about.
09:15 Really, time is an abstract concept that humans have invented
09:19 to explain, compare, and measure what we observe.
09:25 Sometimes, time seems to move faster than at other times.
09:30 There’s an old saying that “a watched kettle never boils.”
09:34 It’s true that when
09:36 we are watching time, when we are conscious of it,
09:39 when we are waiting for something to happen,
09:41 then it seems to pass ever so slowly.
09:45 However, if we are busy,
09:47 if we are interested in and preoccupied with what we are doing,
09:51 then it really appears that time flies.
09:55 Moreover, with older people, time seems to pass
09:58 much more quickly than with young children.
10:02 And why is this?
10:04 One year added to the life of a one-year-old
10:07 means a 100-percent increase.
10:10 One year added to the life of a 50-year-old
10:13 means just 2 percent more.
10:17 The perception of time is also subject to circumstances.
10:21 When a couple in love meets,
10:23 they wish time would stand still, is it not so?
10:28 But they cannot slow down what is perceived as time.
10:33 On the other hand, when somebody is sick in a hospital bed,
10:36 he might wish that time would pass more quickly
10:40 so he could recover sooner and go home sooner.
10:43 But he cannot speed up the passing of time.
10:48 Time is an observed phenomenon by means of which
10:52 we humans sense and record
10:54 changes in our environment and in the universe.
10:58 In the universe, time is measured
11:00 based on the speed of light, which is a constant.
11:05 The Michelson-Morley experiment, around the end of the 19th century,
11:09 discovered that the speed of light is the same
11:12 regardless of the direction it’s heading
11:16 and regardless of the motion
11:19 of the originating source.
11:22 Light moves at about
11:25 300,000 kilometers per second.
11:30 It takes about 100,000 years for a beam of light
11:34 to travel from just one end of our Milky Way to the other end.
11:39 And our Milky Way
11:41 is said to have
200 billion stars like the sun.
11:48 What you see
11:50 when you look up at night to the night sky,
11:55 it’s not what is there now,
11:57 but what was there in the past.
12:00 When a light beam from a star that is a million light years away
12:04 hits the earth,
12:06 it means that the object that you now see
12:09 was there a million years ago.
12:13 To see what is there now
12:16 and whether the star even still exists,
12:18 you need to wait another million years
12:21 until the light beam from that place arrives at the earth.
12:24 Just imagine!
12:26 Looking at the universe, we always look only into the past.
12:33 It is estimated that the visible universe
12:35 exists for 13 billion years.
12:38 Most scientists agree that it had a beginning,
12:41 so-called big bang.
12:43 The Bible says:
12:45 “In the beginning God created,” and that includes the visible universe.
12:49 The universe expands in all directions.
12:53 Scientists have not found an end of the visible universe
12:57 with optical telescopes or radio telescopes.
13:00 But if one would continue to travel through space long enough,
13:05 logically one should come to an area where there are no more
13:10 stars or galaxies, just empty space.
13:14 Some known galaxies are moving into that empty space,
13:19 or toward that empty space, with about the speed of light.
13:23 It’s very impressive.
13:25 Some scientists say, “Time does not exist.”
13:29 It exists, however, definitely in our perception.
13:33 Man invented the concept of time
13:36 to be able to measure changes.
13:40 Did time always exist?
13:43 Well, in Jude 25,
13:48 we can read what it says there
13:52 from our own Bible.
13:54 It says:
13:56 “To the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord,
14:00 “be glory, majesty, might, and authority
14:03 “for all past eternity
14:06 “and now and into all eternity.
14:10 Amen.”
14:12 Well, we know Jehovah had no beginning.
14:15 We have a hard time grasping that.
14:19 When Jehovah was alone before he created the Logos,
14:23 there was no change, because Jehovah does not change.
14:27 This helps us to understand in what way Jehovah always existed.
14:32 Jehovah is not subject to time.
14:35 He exists independently and outside
14:37 from what we perceive as time.
14:41 Where the New World Translation
14:43 translates “past eternity,” in Jude 25,
14:47 the Greek original text
14:49 says “before all time.”
14:54 Surprise, surprise—before time.
14:57 The conclusion is that time had a beginning.
15:02 Is this a new understanding? No.
15:05 If you want to put down a reference,
15:07 Watchtower, 1982, September 1—
15:12 September 1, page 22, and paragraph 17.
15:16 It says about this verse in Jude 25:
15:19 “Jude appropriately ascribed glory, majesty,
15:22 “might and authority to Jehovah
15:24 ‘for all past eternity,’”
15:27 or to quote The Watchtower,
15:29 “‘before all time,’
15:33 as men might know it.”
15:37 We seem safe to say
15:40 that time as we know it, as humans,
15:42 came into being when Jehovah
15:44 started to create first the Logos.
15:48 But what we perceive as time now
15:50 will continue forever and ever in the future.
15:55 At 1 Corinthians 7:29, it says:
15:58 “Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced.”
16:03 Christ had given his disciples
16:06 the sign of his presence and had warned them:
16:09 “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know
16:11 on what day your Lord is coming.”
16:14 —Matthew 24:3, 42.
16:18 The time left was “reduced”
16:21 in the sense that those first-century Christians
16:25 had to live constantly in expectation of Christ’s coming.
16:30 Furthermore, they did not know
16:32 how much time remained for them individually
16:35 before “time and unforeseen occurrence”
16:39 brought their life to a close.
16:42 As an important event nears, there’s an increased sense of urgency.
16:47 How can we illustrate that?
16:50 Well, suppose there’s a wedding.
16:52 The days before are very busy in order to prepare well for the event.
16:57 Even on the wedding day, the bride will be urgently preparing herself
17:01 so the wedding party does not have to wait,
17:05 which would be very impolite.
17:08 If you have to catch a flight,
17:11 you are perhaps urgently and nervously preparing your luggage,
17:15 making sure that you are at the airport on time
17:19 because you do not want to miss the flight.
17:23 Suppose a farmer has a mature crop ready to be harvested.
17:27 Suddenly, there is a storm warning.
17:30 Dark clouds loom at the horizon.
17:34 The storm could destroy the crop.
17:37 Don’t you think that he’ll urgently organize
17:40 his whole household to go out to the field
17:42 and begin to bring in the crop
17:45 before the storm hits?
17:48 Christians are involved in a harvesting work.
17:51 John 4:35 quotes Jesus, saying:
17:54 ‘View the fields, that they are ripe for harvesting.’
17:57 The harvest time will soon be over.
18:00 So are we making good use of our time
18:04 to help bring in the harvest?
18:07 “The harvest is great, but the workers are few,”
18:10 said Jesus.—Matthew 9:37.
18:13 And that shows the urgency.
18:16 The hurricane of the great tribulation is close!
18:21 It’s a hurricane in the illustration, so we need to hurry.
18:26 When a woman is close to giving birth
18:30 and the birth pangs started —the water broke, let’s say—
18:34 then it is urgent to rush her to the hospital
18:37 or call a midwife to come to the home.
18:41 Jesus’ death was  a much more important event
18:43 than a wedding, a birth, a flight, or a crop.
18:47 As the appointed time for Jesus’ sacrificial death
18:50 drew near, his sense of urgency increased.
18:54 Jesus stepped up his activity and his preaching
18:58 as the time for him to be on earth ran out.
19:03 True Christians have always lived with a sense of urgency.
19:07 In the first century, Christians in Judea and Jerusalem
19:12 needed to “keep on the watch,”
19:14 and that was imperative because Jesus warned
19:18 that the Roman armies would come and would attack the city.
19:22 And he said:
19:23 “Let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains.”
19:26 It was urgent!
19:27 Now more than ever, the time that remains
19:30 before Jehovah destroys false religion
19:32 through political elements is reduced.
19:37 It is vital, then, that we make
19:39 wise use of our time —the time that remains.
19:43 How?
19:44 As the apostle Paul explains in Ephesians 5:16,
19:47 we must ‘buy out the opportune time’ for “the more important things”
19:52 at the expense of what is nonessential.
19:57 We need to make every day count.
20:00 Do we live as though the end  could come at any time,
20:03 or do we live as though it is far off?
20:06 Jesus warned:
20:07 “The Son of man is coming at an hour that you
20:10 do not think to be it.” —Matthew 24:44.
20:16 Our pattern of life reflects how much we trust in Jehovah
20:21 by putting faith in his prophetic Word,
20:23 keeping the urgency of the times in mind.
20:27 Avoid a complacent attitude,
20:31 like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah had.
20:35 ‘They were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building,’ said Jesus.
20:40 ‘But on the day that Lot came out of Sodom,
20:42 ‘it rained fire and sulfur from heaven  and destroyed them all.’
20:46 —Luke 17:28, 29.
20:50 It was urgent for Lot and his family to flee,
20:52 and it’s urgent for us too.
20:55 We need to be prepared.
20:59 We can prepare, for instance, if we live in an earthquake zone
21:03 by having our houses built earthquake-proof.
21:08 It costs more
21:10 —more effort, more time involved preparing the house—
21:13 but when an earthquake hits,
21:15 then we are better prepared to survive.
21:20 Revelation refers to “the four angels who”
21:23 have prepared the hour,
21:26 or “have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year,”
21:30 units of time that we can understand. —Revelation 9:14, 15.
21:35 Seeing how prophecies were fulfilled at specific times
21:40 should inspire faith in the God of “times and seasons”
21:45 and in his Word.
21:47 Soon the angels will let loose the four winds of destruction.
21:51 Are we ready?
21:53 Jehovah is a perfect Timekeeper.
21:58 Do we make good use of what we perceive as time
22:00 by attending meetings, reading the Bible daily
22:04 —even after Gilead graduation—
22:08 going out in field ministry?
22:10 Whereas, it is appropriate to take time for leisure and other activities,
22:15 it is good not to waste time
22:19 but keep the balance.
22:21 If we use time wisely
22:23 —buying it out by giving priority to spiritual things
22:27 and sacrifice less important time as a payment, so to say—
22:31 then we will see the promise fulfilled
22:33 to live forever and ever and ever.
22:37 No more need, then, to worry about time.
22:40 But now is the time to conclude my talk,
22:43 so I would not go overtime.
23:10 Thank you very much, Brother Lösch.
23:12 We thoroughly enjoyed that,
23:15 and we appreciate your hard work and meditation.
23:19 Now, we’ll share some greetings
23:22 from various branches
23:25 and highlight some of the things
23:28 that they wanted to pass on.
23:31 Angola: “With their faith strengthened by means of a thorough study of God’s Word
23:36 “and refined spiritual qualities, the graduates will give a fine contribution
23:41 to further stabilize and strengthen Jehovah’s organization.”
23:46 Then Argentina:
23:48 “Although the school of Gilead
23:50 “will soon become a memory
23:52 [they didn’t know  about Brother Herd’s talk]
23:54 you will treasure it for the rest of your lives.”
23:57 Armenia: “We rejoice with you graduates on this special day.
24:02 “We’re delighted to see how Jehovah is training
24:04 more brothers and sisters to take on additional responsibility.”
24:09 Benin: You’ll find this one quite interesting.
24:12 This part I’ll pass on.
24:14 “To all of you [and this is to the students, or graduates]
24:18 “Please, hurry up!
24:20 We are waiting for you out here in the worldwide field.”
24:25 Bolivia: “Our hearts rejoice along with you, dear Gilead graduates,
24:30 on this day that brings so much praise to our heavenly Father.”
24:34 And then Britain: “What a wonderful blessing
24:36 “and unique privilege it is for each student to have
24:39 his or her faith strengthened through an intensive study of God’s Word.”
24:43 Burundi: “The five months of Bible training that you have received
24:47 “will give added impetus to the all-important work
24:50 of helping all who are ‘rightly disposed for everlasting life.’”
24:55 And then Congo (Kinshasa): “We ‘rejoice with those who rejoice.’
25:00 This is, indeed, a special day for all the graduates.”
25:03 Georgia, the country: “Congratulations
25:06 on successfully completing the spiritually enriching course of study.”
25:11 Germany: “Please accept warm love and greetings
25:14 “from Selters Bethel in Germany!
25:17 “Jehovah, as our Grand Instructor,
25:20 continues to educate his servants in a wonderful way.”
25:23 Haiti: “This graduation is another proof that Jehovah
25:27 does treat his loyal servants in a ‘special way.’”
25:31 And then France: “We wish to send you
25:33 “the very warm love from the France Bethel family
25:36 as you are about to receive your diplomas along with your service assignments.”
25:40 And Japan sends their “warm Christian love and greetings.
25:44 All graduates must have experienced firsthand Jehovah’s loving care.”
25:49 Kenya: “As you now take the benefit
25:52 “of this training with you  to your assignments,
25:55 we are confident that ‘Jehovah will be with you wherever you go.’”
25:59 The Netherlands: “Please accept our warm love and greetings,
26:02 “and may Jehovah continue to bless you in your assignment,
26:05 whether a new one or one you are familiar with.”
26:08 Nigeria sends their “warmest greetings to all.”
26:12 Paraguay passes on their wish to have
26:15 ‘Jehovah bless all your efforts in training.’
26:18 Solomon Islands, known as the Happy Isles,
26:21 wishes to send their “warmest Christian love and greetings.”
26:25 Suriname: This is quite interesting.
26:27 They share this point:
26:30 “In 1959, two brothers from Suriname
26:33 “attended the 32nd class of Gilead.
26:35 “Since then, many in Suriname nurtured the dream of going to Gilead.
26:40 “Now, 57 years later,
26:42 we rejoice with the privilege of having one more student attending a class.”
26:47 And then Thailand:
26:49 “From the Land of Smiles, we add our happy smiles
26:53 to yours and send our warm love and greetings to all on this special day.”
26:57 And finally, Ukraine:
27:00 “During the past five months, the Great Potter, Jehovah God,
27:03 “was intensely molding you so that you can now say:
27:06 “‘We are all the clay, and you are our Potter;
27:10 we are all the work of your hand.’”
27:13 So we appreciate those sincere greetings
27:16 from our brothers throughout the earth.
27:21 Now, before we share
27:24 the diplomas with you,
27:26 we want to just pass on these statistics.
27:29 The brothers like to receive these.
27:31 For this particular 141st class:
27:34 number of single brothers, 12;
27:36 number of single sisters, 4;
27:39 number of married couples, 16;
27:42 total number of students, 48;
27:45 their average age, 40.8;
27:49 average years in the truth, 25.1;
27:52 average years in full-time ministry, 19.0.
27:57 So for those that love statistics,
28:02 you now have them.
28:05 Now, we’re going to have the presentation
28:09 of the diplomas to the 141st class of Gilead.
28:13 Brother David Schafer is going to help me.
28:16 He’s a helper to the Teaching Committee,
28:18 and he’ll be helping as we
28:20 pass on the diplomas
28:23 to these graduates of the 141st class of Gilead.
28:26 So let’s take a look at them.
28:58 So, first, we have Brother and Sister Barnizo,
29:01 who will be returning to the Philippines.

33:51 and Brother Richard Cook will do that for the class.
34:02 “To the Governing Body and the Bethel family.
34:04 “Dear Brothers:
34:07 “From the moment we received our invitations to Gilead
34:10 “down to this day of graduation,
34:13 “we feel we have received a gift of undeserved kindness
34:18 “from Jehovah and his organization.
34:20 “There is nothing that we have done or could ever do
34:25 “to deserve the instruction, training, molding,
34:30 “and loving attention that we have received over the past five months.
34:35 “Just as Isaiah 26:12 says:
34:40 “‘O Jehovah, . . .
34:42 “everything we have done you have accomplished for us.’
34:48 “Jehovah has given us the privilege
34:51 “of experiencing close association
34:54 “with you dear brothers of the Governing Body.
34:58 “Your humility, your love for the brotherhood,
35:03 “and your absolute determination
35:05 “to follow Jehovah’s direction have deeply impressed us.
35:11 “We saw this clearly during your faith-strengthening lectures
35:16 “but also in the lighter moments
35:18 “that you shared with us outside of the classroom,
35:21 “all the while preparing for your move to Warwick.
35:25 “Seeing your examples firsthand has only made us more convinced
35:30 “that this is the organization
35:32 “Jehovah is blessing and directing today.
35:37 “What a true joy it has been for us
35:40 “to be part of this delightful Bethel family!
35:45 “You’ve been an example in hospitality,
35:49 “making us feel at home away from home.
35:53 “The excellent work of so many departments has created an environment
35:58 “where studying day and night and night and day
36:01 “was both possible and enjoyable.
36:05 “An essential part of our learning experience
36:09 “has been seeing the faith
36:11 “of so many of you long-time members of the family.
36:15 “We have also learned from the faith of you,
36:18 “the many commuters and temporary volunteers,
36:21 “who willingly make yourselves available
36:24 “to serve here at Bethel.
36:28 “We are truly grateful to you, our dear instructors,
36:33 “for generously giving of your very selves,
36:37 “both mind and heart,
36:39 “in the way that you have taught us.
36:42 “During our training, your love for the Bible truth
36:45 “that you were teaching touched us deeply.
36:47 “Your accuracy and yet your warmth,
36:51 “your seriousness and yet your humor
36:55 “showed us a balance worthy of imitation.
36:59 “Your obvious determination to hold fast to the direction
37:03 “of ‘the faithful and discreet slave’
37:05 “has made  a lasting impression on us.
37:09 “As we go to our assignments, we are resolved to do
37:13 “as 1 Peter 4:10 states:
37:17 “‘To the extent that each one has received a gift,
37:22 “‘use it in ministering to one another
37:26 “as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness.’
37:30 “Gilead has been a priceless gift
37:33 “from Jehovah through all of you.
37:36 “Having been shown such undeserved kindness,
37:40 “we desire to use it to demonstrate our love for Jehovah.
37:46 “More than ever before, we are determined to continue
37:50 “to advance the preaching of the good news and to strengthen our brothers.
37:54 “It is our earnest prayer that this be our life’s work,
38:00 “all to the honor and glory of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
38:05 Your brothers and sisters of the 141st class of Gilead.”
38:36 Before we have a brief moment
38:40 for some concluding comments, I have some more statistics.
38:44 But this is of interest to us with the attendance figures:
38:49 Canada, 679;
38:52 the United States, that’s 9,814.
38:56 But this is who that includes:
38:58 Patterson, 3,519;
39:01 Brooklyn, 1,405;
39:04 Fishkill, 763;
39:07 Wallkill, 2,540;
39:10 Warwick, 1,219;
39:14 Curaçao, 61;
39:16 Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 134;
39:19 Jamaica, 37; and Puerto Rico, 136.
39:24 So that makes a grand total of 10,493.
39:40 I don’t know what the delay was for,
39:42 but they all know hundreds of thousands
39:46 are going to see it pretty soon.
39:48 And that’s really what I wanted to just pass on to you.
39:52 Just a brief review of some of the key thoughts,
39:56 and we certainly can’t touch on all of it.
39:58 But “See—The Cloud!”
40:00 Follow the cloud, not men— nice reminder.
40:05 And of course, you’ll always remember Brother Herd’s talk,
40:08 and nice thought, “Smells ring bells.”
40:13 Again, the translators will have fun with that.
40:17 And then the warning about ego; it’s a good caution, counsel.
40:21 And nice thoughts about testing Jehovah and being tested.
40:25 And, of course, all the good experiences and interviews
40:29 and Brother Lösch reminding us to make good use of our time.
40:34 So it’s been a wonderful program.
40:36 What’s nice, too, because you get into your assignment
40:40 and because Jehovah has blessed us with the broadcasting of the program
40:45 —so that will be up there in due course—
40:47 and now this has been permeating
40:50 with excitement with your family and close friends.
40:54 And see now,
40:56 with Jehovah’s blessing on this project,
40:59 you can go and play it months from now.
41:02 You might face some discouraging circumstance.
41:05 Well, go back, and you can stop it
41:09 —think about it.
41:11 I mean, what a blessing, especially for you graduates
41:14 to be able to go back and then just absorb more.
41:17 So keep that in mind, and Jehovah will bless you
41:22 with good, good reminders in the days ahead.
41:27 So at this point, we’re going to invite all—
41:31 Now, we were supposed to all be ready to sing this new song,
41:36 and I know my wife and I practiced.
41:39 We hope you practiced.
41:41 Those that know how to read music,
41:44 please sing out and help those around you.
41:48 It’s a beautiful song, and I love the lyrics now.
41:52 See, because we’ve had—
41:54 One of my favorites is song 135 in the songbook we have at this point.
41:59 But see, this has a message here,
42:01 and you sing and you keep this in mind in your assignment:
42:05 “We Will,” not might,
42:08 “We Will Keep Enduring.”
42:10 So take these lyrics to heart as you go to your assignments.
42:14 So let’s stand and sing song number 154.
42:17 And then Brother Leon Weaver,
42:19 a helper to the Service Committee of the Governing Body,
42:21 will conclude with prayer.

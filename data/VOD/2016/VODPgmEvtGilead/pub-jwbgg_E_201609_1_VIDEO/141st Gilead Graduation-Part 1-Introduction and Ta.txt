00:04 So we welcome you to the graduation
00:07 of the 141st class of Gilead.
00:10 And as a reminder,
00:13 it’s requested that no flash cameras
00:16 be used during the program.
00:18 Any picture taken without flash
00:21 must be taken from your seat location.
00:24 No recordings of any kind are permitted.
00:27 Cellular telephones, electronic tablets,
00:31 or similar devices should not be used
00:34 to transmit any part of the program.
00:38 Program notes,  whether hard copy or electronic,
00:42 should not be distributed to others.
00:46 Now to begin our program,
00:49 we’ll open and sing song number 107,
00:54 “Come to Jehovah’s Mountain.”
00:56 And then, Brother Troy Snyder, a member  of the United States Branch Committee,
01:00 will offer our opening prayer.
01:02 So we invite you to stand.  It’s song 107.
03:51 So the special day has finally arrived.
03:55 And we know your family and close friends
03:58 are pleased to be here  to share this special occasion.
04:02 Of course, all the rest are enjoying
04:06 the moment with you  because it’s a spiritual program.
04:10 And, of course, now we broadcast it later.
04:13 And the whole brotherhood,  for the most part,
04:16 is able to benefit  from this special activity
04:20 that for many years  was only at Bethel itself.
04:24 Now,
04:27 your class enjoyed  the spring here at Patterson
04:32 and enjoyed the summer at Patterson
04:36 —beautiful surroundings.
04:38 And Jehovah sure did bless  his earthly part of his organization
04:43 to have such a place to be educated.
04:46 However, now you’ll be leaving  for your assignments,
04:51 and we’re going to be entering  into the fall season.
04:56 So . . .
04:59 Most years that can be spectacular  in upstate New York.
05:03 Of course, New England is renowned
05:05 for the beauty of the leaves changing
05:08 —these radiant colors.
05:10 It’s just— Jehovah just amazes us
05:13 with what can happen each fall season.
05:16 And it put me in mind
05:18 (because we’re soon to experience it,
05:21 and hopefully it’ll be  a good season this year)
05:24 of a picture I had in the past,  and I appreciated it.
05:29 It was a beautiful picture of a lake
05:32 with trees surrounding the lake,
05:34 very nice,  and it was a fall scene.
05:37 And so all of these beautiful trees,
05:40 the radiant colors around the water
05:42 —it just kind of makes you think about  the site there at Warwick
05:47 and what’s coming this fall.
05:49 And the reason I bring it up
05:52 is because  the caption for the picture was,
05:56 “Change—The only thing  permanent is change.”
06:03 Is that true?
06:05 I see some heads going like that.
06:08 No, not all the time.
06:10 But we can understand why imperfect humans  would come to that conclusion.
06:14 But Jehovah is permanently the true God.
06:20 Thankfully that will never change!
06:23 And there are other things  that don’t change.
06:27 Integrity-keepers that are  already experiencing Jehovah’s favor
06:32 —those holy angels— they didn’t change, see.
06:35 But I bring it up because  we’ve entered such a time
06:40 where all these changes are going on,
06:42 and your class has been held
06:46 during some historic changes
06:50 —can’t minimize that.
06:52 It’s been quite phenomenal.
06:54 Now, when you think about  the class you’re in
06:58 and the historic things  that are going on,
07:01 yours is the last class to be held
07:05 when headquarters was in Brooklyn.
07:09 Yep.  Had you thought about that?
07:12 Last one.
07:16 Now, many of us have  already moved to Warwick.
07:19 So the headquarters staff  that’ll be living there
07:22 is just moving in on it.
07:25 We’ve been moving for months
07:27 —all these three different sites—
07:29 and there’s more moving to come.
07:31 And we rejoice that it worked out
07:35 (as the Construction Project Committee
07:37 and the thousands that supported them,  brothers and sisters),
07:41 things speeded up,  and we got in there
07:44 or are going in there a few months early.
07:47 So that’s a rejoicing moment.
07:50 Tours, as was mentioned  in the broadcast this September,
07:53 don’t begin till next year,  but Jehovah was kind to you
07:57 and brought you over this week  to see some of Warwick.
08:00 And I see your big smiles.
08:02 You enjoyed that,  even though there are things
08:05 you might want  to come back in the future
08:08 to see when the tours  really do begin to function.
08:11 So we know you’re enjoying
08:14 the experience here of being educated.
08:16 But if you think about it,
08:19 what does this tell us about Jehovah?
08:21 With moving—  And I’ve been telling folks for some months,
08:25 “Years back we made the statement that
08:28 “(and this was according to  some studies that were done)
08:31 “the death of a loved one,  divorce, and moving
08:35 —three top stressors in life!”
08:38 Ugh! And those that are moving  can tell you, “Oh yeah!”
08:43 But it’s right up there  with the death of a loved one and divorce.
08:48 So that’s stress!
08:50 So you might wonder, well,  why, in the middle of all of this
08:53 and these changes  we knew were going to happen,
08:56 we still had the class of Gilead.
08:59 You still were invited.
09:01 Why did we not say,  “Well, let’s, you know, let’s be reasonable
09:04 and hold off and have one  after this stressful period is over?”
09:09 The U.S. Branch Committee gives  such beautiful support
09:12 to headquarters as well.
09:14 Let’s . . .  Unh-unh.
09:16 And it just shows you
09:18 Jehovah directs this organization, period!
09:22 He’s governing it,  and he just loves you
09:27 —because this is addressed,  these comments, primarily to you—
09:31 and wants you educated.
09:33 And it’s just his warm embrace  for you that you’re invited.
09:37 And you did enjoy it.
09:39 You had all the deep study and all of that,
09:43 but all that was going on around you,  I think you’d agree,
09:47 didn’t affect how you  were instructed and what was done.
09:50 So it tells us that Jehovah—
09:53 And you can see it,  especially in recent years
09:56 —so much emphasis  on education.
09:59 And I am reminded  of what Elihu said here,
10:03 and a beautiful thought here
10:06 in Job chapter 36,
10:10 Job chapter 36.
10:13 And we’re going to see where  he makes this statement
10:18 in verse 22:
10:21 “Look!  God is exalted in his power.”
10:25 And then notice:  “What instructor is like him?”
10:30 Well, you’re not supposed to try  to come up with an answer.
10:34 That’s a question that answers itself.
10:38 “What instructor is like him?”
10:42 There is none —no instructor like Jehovah God.
10:45 Unh-unh.  No.
10:48 In fact, when we think about  our heavenly Father,
10:51 the Grand Instructor,
10:54 we’re reminded  of Romans here, chapter 11.
10:58 So if you would,  please find Romans chapter 11.
11:03 And this reveals to us
11:06 why the only one
11:09 that never needed  education or instruction
11:13 is our heavenly Father,  Jehovah God.
11:15 And Jesus  would tell you that as well.
11:19 He was instructed  by his Father personally,
11:23 “firstborn of all creation.”
11:25 And when you think about  the warm embrace and his love for you here—
11:29 Because I know you’re closer to Jehovah  than when you first arrived
11:33 —has to happen with this course,
11:37 with the fine instructors we have.
11:39 But Romans 11:33, 34:
11:46 “O the depth of God’s riches  and wisdom and knowledge!
11:50 “How unsearchable his judgments are
11:54 “and beyond tracing out his ways are!
11:57 “For ‘who has come  to know Jehovah’s mind,
12:00 or who has become his adviser?’”
12:03 So you have to think about that  and let that sink in:
12:06 The riches of his wisdom and knowledge
12:10 —it’s just unfathomable!
12:12 You just have to let that sink in
12:15 —‘the depth of God’s riches,  wisdom, and knowledge!’
12:19 There’s no way to search out his judgments
12:22 —can’t trace out his ways.
12:24 That’s why we adore  and worship Jehovah God.
12:28 And you can’t know his mind  (none of us can)
12:32 until he reveals it.
12:34 That’s why sometimes  you’ll hear brothers and sisters
12:38 (sincerely so, I’m sure)
12:40 kind of speculating,  and I go:
12:44 ‘Um-huh, OK.
12:48 ‘Somebody thinks  they know Jehovah’s mind
12:52 beyond what  He gave us here. OK.’
12:55 But we don’t follow creatures;
12:58 we follow Jehovah God  because he’s our Grand Instructor.
13:03 And you’re a lot closer to him,
13:06 assuring yourself  of being taught by him
13:10 when you get into your assignment
13:12 as well as on into eternity.
13:16 Now, there are some fine thoughts  prepared for you
13:20 from brothers to follow.
13:22 I thought I’d just give you  a brief preview
13:24 —just to get you to focus.
13:26 And the rest in attendance  will be able to do that.
13:29 But this is for your benefit.
13:32 You’re going find out  about a cloud.
13:38 OK, that’s all I’m telling you.
13:40 You’re going to find out  about an enemy,
13:44 and it’s not Satan  in this particular theme.
13:48 You’re going to find out  about testing Jehovah out.
13:53 And then,  we always enjoy your experiences.
13:57 So we look forward to that,  and I know the pressure is on you.
14:00 You look forward to being finished  and successfully so.
14:05 And then,  nice interviews with some of you
14:08 about how are you going  to use your gift.
14:10 And then, the principal talk  about making good use of your time.
14:15 So it’s some nice thoughts,
14:17 and we look forward  to the presentations by these brothers.
14:22 First, we have Brother Ralph Walls,
14:25 who is a helper  to the Personnel Committee
14:27 and a member  of the United States Branch Committee.
14:31 And Brother Walls has the theme
14:33 “See—the Cloud!”
14:47 First of all, I’d like to say:
14:49 On behalf  of the United States Branch Committee,
14:53 we really do rejoice with you.
14:55 And it’s been a real pleasure  to get to know some of you
14:58 —hopefully, most of you.
15:02 But your example of love  and appreciation for Jehovah
15:06 and the earthly part of his organization
15:10 is really motivating.
15:12 One couple in this class experienced  what was a very emotional time
15:17 just after learning of their invitation.
15:21 The sister’s father fell ill,  and then he died.
15:26 It was a real challenge for them,
15:28 but they accepted  the invitation to come to Gilead.
15:33 A brother was special pioneering  in his branch territory,
15:36 and then he was invited  to the branch temporarily.
15:40 Another change came:  He was reassigned as a special pioneer.
15:45 And then there were adjustments
15:47 for some of the special pioneers  to regular pioneer,
15:50 and he thought,  ‘Well, I’ll go back to regular pioneering.’
15:53 He was invited to Gilead,
15:57 but his father died.
15:59 He came; he’s here.
16:03 We could go on with other examples.
16:06 Now, what does  this have to do with the cloud?
16:10 Well, let’s see.
16:12 Please turn with me  to Numbers chapter 9.
16:15 And we’ll read together  beginning in verse 17,
16:22 Numbers 9:17:
16:27 “Whenever the cloud  lifted from the tent,
16:32 “the Israelites would promptly depart,
16:35 “and in the place  where the cloud would remain,
16:39 “there is where  the Israelites would encamp.
16:42 “At the order of Jehovah  the Israelites would depart,
16:46 “and at the order of Jehovah  they would encamp.
16:51 “As long as the cloud  remained over the tabernacle,
16:54 “they would remain encamped.
16:56 “When the cloud would stay over  the tabernacle for many days,
17:00 “the Israelites would obey  Jehovah and not depart.
17:05 “Sometimes the cloud would remain  for a few days over the tabernacle.
17:09 “At the order of Jehovah  they would remain encamped,
17:13 “and at the order of Jehovah  they would depart.
17:17 “Sometimes the cloud would remain  only from evening until morning,
17:22 “and when the cloud lifted in the morning,  they would depart.
17:26 “Whether it was day or night
17:30 “when the cloud lifted,  they would depart.
17:34 “Whether it was two days,  a month, or longer,
17:37 “as long as the cloud  stayed over the tabernacle,
17:40 “the Israelites remained encamped  and would not depart.
17:43 “But when it lifted,  they would depart.
17:47 “At the order of Jehovah  they would encamp,
17:52 “and at the order of Jehovah  they would depart.
17:57 “They kept their obligation to Jehovah
18:01 at the order of Jehovah through Moses.”
18:06 Interesting.
18:08 That phrase “at the order of Jehovah”  appears seven times.
18:13 You see,  Jehovah was in total control.
18:18 When that cloud moved,  the nation moved.
18:21 And did you notice  how they would do so?
18:24 “Promptly.”
18:26 Now, whether it was ‘a few days,  a month, or longer,’
18:30 if the commandment was to leave  in the middle of the night
18:34 or during the morning or day,  it made no difference.
18:38 They would move.
18:40 Why?
18:42 They saw the cloud.
18:44 Now imagine a camp  of about three million people.
18:48 The watchmen have seen  the fiery cloud at night.
18:52 It’s lifted up  from the tabernacle,
18:56 and it’s pointing to the north.
19:00 Suddenly, after a year  of camping in one spot,
19:05 the shrill notes of a silver trumpet  cleave the air.
19:08 And after a brief interval
19:11 in which the camp waits to see  if there would be fluctuating blasts,
19:15 which signaled the breaking up  of the camp, they move.
19:19 Now, that means  the whole camp of Israel
19:23 changed its position promptly.
19:26 Three million people
19:28 —mothers shaking  their children out of sleep;
19:31 daughters  packing up belongings;
19:33 sons rounding up  the family livestock;
19:37 fathers putting all  of the items on the animals.
19:42 And in a little time,
19:44 the whole camp would be  on the march to who knows where.
19:48 They certainly didn’t
19:51 —until they made  their next encampment.
19:53 They saw the cloud,  and they knew
19:58 that it was Jehovah  who was directing them.
20:01 Now, you folks are examples  of those who “see the cloud.”
20:06 You know that Jehovah
20:08 —not the imperfect men  that he’s using—
20:11 is in total control.
20:13 And we humans find it  generally difficult to change,
20:16 as you heard  in our dear Brother Morris’ comments.
20:21 But Jehovah’s people,
20:23 from the days of Abraham  down to our day,
20:26 have seen that we’ve had to be  humble, flexible, and obedient.
20:31 We must maintain spiritual vision.
20:36 We have to “see the cloud.”
20:39 Psalm 78:14 reminds us
20:43 that it was Jehovah  who used that cloud.
20:47 There was a 39-year-old sister  (single sister)
20:50 serving at Bethel for eight years,
20:52 and she made herself available  for wherever she could best serve.
20:56 Well, she was asked to attend SKE,
20:59 the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
21:01 And she received an assignment  that was shocking to her:
21:04 to a country  where the work is restricted
21:07 —single sister.
21:09 She said this,
21:11 “I am extremely grateful to Jehovah  for this undeserved blessing
21:16 and also for the trust and support  that I’ve been given.”
21:20 A married couple who served together  at Bethel for 25 years
21:24 —he served before that totaling 32 years—
21:29 they were recently assigned  as special pioneers
21:31 after all those years at Bethel.
21:34 You know what they said?
21:36 I’ll quote them:
21:38 “We have feelings,  of course.
21:40 “Why would anyone  want to leave Bethel?
21:42 “It’s easy to forget  that when we came to Bethel,
21:45 “we had a preference  but we agreed to be assigned anywhere.
21:49 “Lovingly,  Jehovah watches how we display
21:52 submission and loyalty  to his organization.”
21:57 Now, in the United States branch territory,
22:00 there’s an ongoing effort  to better utilize Kingdom Halls,
22:05 and this has resulted  in many publishers
22:07 being assigned to different congregations —more to come.
22:12 Now, commenting on the general benefits,
22:14 here’s what one circuit overseer said:
22:18 “This lets the friends know  how to rely on Jehovah.
22:22 “This woke a lot of people up.
22:25 “Learn obedience, submissiveness,
22:27 “and how to follow direction.
22:30 “The elders  and ministerial servants
22:32 did an excellent job  at demonstrating this.
22:34 “The friends will even more learn  to a greater degree
22:39 as they assimilate  into their new congregations.”
22:42 Interesting.
22:45 Think about it.
22:47 During the wilderness trek,
22:49 Jehovah might have moved the cloud  in the middle of the night,
22:53 and their locations  may not have seemed logical
22:56 from a human standpoint.
22:58 Why would Jehovah do such a thing?
23:00 We don’t know.
23:01 Maybe he could see the movement  of enemy camps toward Israel.
23:06 Whatever the case, it was vital  that they would have responded promptly.
23:12 All of us today need to “see the cloud”
23:17 as we get closer to the great tribulation.
23:20 The time is now  when we have to obey and not ask,
23:24 “Why did they make that decision?”
23:26 As one traveling overseer said,
23:29 “Don’t put a question mark  where Jehovah puts a period.”
23:35 You dear students  have already shown prompt response
23:40 to direction  that Jehovah’s organization has provided.
23:44 Please do it more fully.
23:47 And to the extent that you do,
23:50 Jehovah will continue to bless you.
23:52 Don’t see the men  that Jehovah is using
23:56 —see the cloud.
23:59 And may all of us do the same.
24:12 Thank you very much,  Brother Walls.
24:14 That was  very faith strengthening.
24:17 And I already have  to ask for forgiveness.
24:19 I forgot to mention  my good friend’s theme
24:23 (but he forgave me in the back)  in the preview.
24:27 Intriguing theme  from Brother Samuel Herd,
24:31 a member of the Governing Body,
24:34 “Let the Memories Sustain You.”
24:41 Earlier, when Brother Morris  didn’t introduce my talk,
24:45 I started to go home.
24:51 And then I remembered  he’s imperfect.
25:02 Thank God for the gift of memory!
25:05 If we couldn’t recall the who, the what,  the where of our everyday lives,
25:10 our lives would be unmanageable.
25:14 We have a short-term memory.
25:17 We have a long-term  (episodic memory, or semantic) memory.
25:23 Sometimes we look at our picture album  on a rainy afternoon,
25:27 and what we see ignites memories.
25:31 The school is over,
25:33 but your memory bank  is very much alive.
25:38 Now, whether we like it or not,
25:40 sometimes different memories  of past events
25:44 pop into our heads  for no apparent reason.
25:50 Smells ring bells.
25:54 A sister spoke to me when we were  in an elevator, and she said,
25:59 “You make me think  of my father, my dad.”
26:05 I thought: ‘It couldn’t be my looks  since she’s white and I am black.
26:13 It couldn’t be my voice  because I haven’t said anything yet.’
26:17 I found out it was  the Old Spice cologne that I had on.
26:24 Smells ring bells.
26:28 One happy thought can spark
26:30 an unending chain of things  you experienced in school.
26:34 It’s like being in school  all over again.
26:38 Now, one or two of us may have heard
26:41 of Solomon Shereshevsky.
26:44 He was born in Russia about 1886.
26:48 He had a memory so perfect
26:50 that he could recall  every minute of his life
26:53 —and that in graphic detail.
26:56 His talent for remembering  was discovered
26:59 when he was  just a young lad of 19 years.
27:04 Now, correct me if I’m wrong;
27:07 I don’t think there is a solitary soul
27:13 in this class, male or female,
27:18 with the recall ability  of Solomon Shereshevsky.
27:24 Nevertheless,  you do have memories,
27:27 and these memories  will sustain you in the days ahead
27:31 as you work for Jehovah in his service.
27:36 Now, you’re not going  to remember everything
27:39 you’ve seen and heard in class  during the last five months.
27:43 Why?
27:45 There’s just no need.
27:47 One authority by the name  of Ashish Ranpura
27:52 made this comment,  see what you think about it:
27:55 “The human brain  is not good at remembering
27:58 “long lists of unrelated numbers,
28:00 “dozens of nonsense words,
28:03 or lengthy grocery lists.”
28:06 For these tasks,  little more is required
28:10 than pen and paper.
28:13 Now, some in the medical profession  have said:
28:18 “We all carry in our personal memory banks  pictures and memories
28:23 of everything we have seen,  done, and heard since birth.”
28:28 Others think that some things  are so ordinary, so non-essential,
28:33 that they are not locked  in our memory banks
28:36 but are cast off.
28:39 What do you think,  you students?
28:44 Think what you want.
28:47 There is no way for us to know.
28:51 Not now,
28:54 maybe later.
28:59 Here’s something you  no doubt will agree with:
29:01 Jehovah can remember  whatever he chooses to remember,
29:04 and he can forget  whatever he wants to forget.
29:08 Now there’s a mind  that tops Solomon Shereshevsky.
29:13 Jehovah’s memory,  or mind, is unfathomable!
29:18 And here’s an interesting comment  from the Bible.
29:23 It’s found here  at 1 Corinthians 2:16.
29:31 It says: “For ‘who has come  to know the mind of Jehovah,
29:38 “so that he may instruct him?’
29:40 But we do have the mind of Christ.”
29:43 No, we can’t know
29:46 in detail God’s mind.
29:49 He permits us to know  just a little bit of it,
29:54 and we’re happy for that.
29:56 But here’s  an interesting thought too:
29:58 He values us  so much that he remembers
30:01 every detail  of our faithful service.
30:05 Our genetic code —he remembers that.
30:08 And all our years  of memories and experiences
30:13 —God can recall.
30:16 Should you die,
30:18 he will restore all this back
30:20 in your new brain  and body that he gives you.
30:23 How do we know that?
30:24 Well, Malachi 3:16  makes a comment.
30:28 This is what it says:
30:31 “At that time those who  feared Jehovah spoke with one another,
30:34 “each one with his companion,
30:36 “and Jehovah  kept paying attention and listening.
30:39 “And,” now note, “a book of remembrance
30:43 “was written before him for those fearing Jehovah
30:47 and for those  meditating on his name.”
30:51 God’s thoughts are  so much higher than ours.
30:56 In the Bible book of Isaiah  as stated in the 55th chapter:
31:00 “‘For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
31:04 “and your ways are not my ways,’  declares Jehovah.
31:09 “‘For as the heavens  are higher than the earth,
31:12 “‘so my ways are  higher than your ways
31:14 and my thoughts  than your thoughts.’”
31:19 So we can never fully understand  all of Jehovah’s thoughts.
31:25 He gives us the ability,  with the help of the holy spirit,
31:28 to recall the thoughts  we need to apply in our lives
31:32 in order to gain his pleasure.
31:35 So we need to do what?
31:37 We need to pray for holy spirit!
31:42 Now, each of our brothers
31:45 who will speak to you today
31:47 and those who have already  had something to say
31:50 prayed for holy spirit  before they ever stepped out here.
31:54 I prayed at length  back there for holy spirit
31:59 so that what comes out of my mouth  will build you up and not tear you down,
32:04 so that what comes out of my mouth  will honor Jehovah and please him
32:08 and be a source of encouragement  to all of my brothers and sisters
32:13 who are able to hear  what I have to say.
32:16 So all of our brothers pray  to that degree
32:19 before they step out  on this stage before an audience
32:22 of your caliber, especially.
32:25 We want to make sure  that what is said will be good for you.
32:32 So God gives us the ability
32:34 to understand a few things  because of holy spirit.
32:38 So we say to you,  “Pray, please, for holy spirit.”
32:41 The spirit  will refresh your memories
32:44 and stimulate  your mental powers.
32:47 It’s the holy spirit  that will help you remember
32:49 what you need to remember
32:52 when you need  to remember something.
32:55 Now, note  this promise of Jesus
32:57 at John 14:25, 26.
33:01 That’s John 14:25, 26:
33:05 “I have spoken these things to you  while I am still with you.
33:09 “But the helper,  the holy spirit,
33:11 “which the Father  will send in my name,
33:16 “that one  will teach you all things
33:19 and bring back to your minds  all the things I told you.”
33:25 In the weeks ahead,
33:28 let the warm,  beautiful memories
33:32 of Gilead sustain you,
33:35 and thank Jehovah for them!
33:39 They gave me 9:00 minutes.
33:41 I used 8:42.
33:57 I just had to delete about four things  I was considering saying.
34:05 But, anyway, the translators  will have fun with the Old Spice.
34:09 It brought back  memories for me too.
34:14 I used to love Old Spice,  by the way.
34:17 Used it a long time and then—
34:25 So Brother James Cauthon,
34:27 one of the instructors  with Theocratic Schools,
34:30 has the theme  “Ego Is Your Enemy.”
34:36 There are a number of definitions  for the expression “ego.”
34:41 But for our brief discussion  this morning,
34:44 we want to focus  on the definition of “ego”
34:47 as it’s used in “egotist”:
34:50 An unhealthy belief  in our own importance;
34:53 the notion of ourselves  that distorts reality.
34:57 Now, we’re not picking  that subject
35:00 because we’ve noticed  any particular problem
35:03 and, believe me,  it’s just been the opposite.
35:05 But there is a tendency,  or leaning,
35:08 that we have  as imperfect people
35:11 to become just a little bit  too self-assured
35:14 —maybe a little bit  too full of ourselves.
35:16 And that’s why the apostle Paul,
35:19 when he was talking about  putting on the new personality,
35:22 in Romans chapter 12
35:24 he gave this reminder in verse 3.
35:28 He said: “For through  the undeserved kindness given to me,
35:32 “I tell everyone there among you
35:35 “not to think more of himself  than it is necessary to think,
35:38 but to think so as  to have a sound mind.”
35:42 Now, without going further,  we can see the balance.
35:47 If we have  the right view of ourselves,
35:50 well, we have “a sound mind.”
35:52 But as soon as we have  an unbalanced view,
35:55 then we have an unsound mind.
35:59 We have a tendency  to become unbalanced.
36:03 But the culture we live in today
36:05 also fans the flames of ego.
36:08 For example,
36:10 it’s never been easier  than today to talk oneself up,
36:13 to puff oneself up,  to brag oneself up
36:16 to thousands, if not millions,
36:20 of so-called followers
36:23 on social media.
36:26 But humility  will help us to see
36:31 that perhaps others  are not quite as interested
36:35 in our accomplishments  as we are.
36:39 So self-worth
36:42 is realizing  that you have value;
36:45 self-importance
36:47 is wanting everyone else  to know it.
36:51 Open your Bibles,  if you would,
36:53 to 1 Corinthians chapter 8.
36:56 First Corinthians chapter 8,
36:58 and we want to give  just four brief reminders.
37:05 First Corinthians 8:1,
37:13 it says: “Knowledge puffs up,
37:16 but love builds up.”
37:18 It’s not enough to be  a student at the beginning.
37:21 It’s a position  that you must assume for life.
37:25 It’s impossible to learn
37:27 what one thinks he already knows.
37:31 The second we tell ourself  that we have graduated,
37:35 learning grinds to a halt.
37:38 A good mind  is certainly a fine asset,
37:42 and still it could become a weakness
37:44 if overconfidence  causes us to develop
37:48 an inflated opinion of ourselves.
37:50 Now,  you haven’t had that happen,
37:53 and likely it won’t happen.
37:55 But after you graduate  as a Gilead graduate,
37:59 you will find that people  will complement you;
38:04 perhaps they will even  flatter you excessively.
38:08 And when that happens,  try to remember this:
38:12 A smart man believes only half  of what people say about him.
38:17 A wise man knows  which half to believe.
38:21 So continue to let the Word of God  and the spirit of God
38:26 make you more like  the Son of God.
38:28 Proverbs 10:14:
38:30 “Those who are wise  treasure up knowledge.”
38:34 But don’t let the knowledge  go to your head
38:38 —just to your head;  let it go to your heart.
38:43 Second area,  turn to Matthew chapter 20,
38:48 and you can leave your Bible  open here if you’d like.
38:52 Matthew 20:28,
38:55 and this goes right to the heart  of your Gilead assignment, all right.
38:59 Jesus said this,
39:01 he said:  “Just as the Son of man came,
39:03 not to be ministered to,  but to minister.”
39:07 And so Jesus  measured greatness
39:10 in terms of service,  not status.
39:14 He willingly took up menial tasks  that everyone else tried to avoid.
39:18 He would wash feet.  He would take care of children.
39:20 Jesus, the Bible says,  “emptied himself.”
39:24 But you know what?
39:26 You can’t empty yourself  if you’re full of yourself.
39:31 Now, imagine  that for every person you met,
39:35 you found  some way to help them
39:37 —a way  that entirely benefited them
39:40 and left you entirely  out of the picture.
39:43 The cumulative effect  that this would have on the brotherhood
39:47 over a period of time  would be profound,
39:50 and it’s not an original idea.
39:52 You see,  Jehovah God and Jesus Christ
39:54 look for opportunities  to do for others.
39:57 And it’s not about  making someone look good
40:02 —it’s about providing the support  so that others can be good.
40:08 Strive to be selfless,  not selfish.
40:13 Philippians 2:3 says:
40:16 “Do nothing out of contentiousness  or out of egotism,
40:19 but with humility  consider others superior to you.”
40:24 Now back to Matthew,
40:26 this time chapter 20  beginning in verse 25.
40:30 This is the third area.
40:34 Jesus, talking to his disciples, said:
40:38 “You know that the rulers  of the nations lord it over them
40:41 “and the great men  wield authority over them.
40:44 “This must not be  the way among you;
40:47 “but whoever wants to become  great among you must be your minister,
40:51 and whoever wants to be  first among you must be your slave.”
40:55 Now,  you’re going to leave here.
40:59 Some of you are going  to be put in positions of oversight.
41:03 But all of you,  brothers and sisters,
41:05 are expected to work as a team.
41:07 So try to remember these things:
41:10 Having authority is not necessarily
41:14 the same as being an authority.
41:18 Having the right is not necessarily
41:21 the same as being right.
41:23 Impressing people is different
41:25 from being truly impressive.
41:27 And learn the difference
41:30 between prominence  and significance.
41:33 See, some of the most significant people  in our organization
41:37 are the ones  that have almost no prominence.
41:40 They’re the ones  that are showing integrity;
41:43 standing firm for the Kingdom;  setting an example in the ministry;
41:47 and making sacrifices
41:49 that maybe only Jehovah, Jesus,  and the holy angels know.
41:53 They’re significant.
41:55 So don’t get caught up  into the trap
41:59 of jockeying for position  or prominence in the organization.
42:03 Because if you do,  that ego that is developing
42:08 will cause you to become a menace  to the brothers and sisters
42:12 that have to work  under your direction.
42:14 The Watchtower put it like this,  it said:
42:17 ‘Ego always beclouds the issue  and obscures the vision.’
42:21 And remember this too:
42:24 A team player does not obsess  about his own image;
42:27 he doesn’t treat people with contempt,  doesn’t need star treatment,
42:30 doesn’t fight, doesn’t lord it over,  isn’t condescending,
42:33 and doesn’t marvel  at his own awesomeness.
42:41 Colossians 3:23:  ‘Whatever you are doing,
42:43 work at it whole-souled  for Jehovah, and not to men.’
42:47 And, finally,  one last point.
42:50 And this is found  at 1 Corinthians 10:12.
42:53 We’re not going to look it up  because there’s simply not time.
42:56 But it says this, it says:
42:58 “Let him that thinks he is standing  beware that he does not fall.”
43:02 Humble people are meek;  they’re not weak.
43:07 Spiritual maturity  is becoming like Jesus
43:10 in the way  we think, feel, and act.
43:12 But self-deception is easy.
43:15 Beware of “the disease of me.”
43:19 Even the best qualities  will have a short shelf life
43:24 if the subscription  is not renewed.
43:26 It’s not enough  to do the right thing;
43:29 you must do the right thing  for the right reason.
43:33 James 4:10 says:
43:35 “Humble yourselves  in the eyes of Jehovah,
43:38 and he will exalt you.”
43:40 So in conclusion,
43:42 it’s admirable to reach out  in Jehovah’s organization,
43:46 to take on additional responsibilities,  to make sacrifices.
43:50 But it is no less impressive  an accomplishment
43:54 to become a better person,
43:56 happier, balanced,  content, humble, and selfless.
44:00 But to do so,  we must remember:
44:03 Ego is your enemy!
44:16 Thank you very much,  Brother Cauthon.
44:18 We appreciated that.
44:20 Next,  Brother William Malenfant,
44:23 who’s a helper  to the Teaching Committee,
44:25 has the theme  “Test Jehovah Out and Be Tested!”
44:33 You students  of the 141st class of Gilead
44:38 have been putting Jehovah  to the test for years.
44:44 It sounds scary,
44:46 but you’ve been doing it  in a good way,
44:50 a way that honors  Jehovah God.
44:53 On the other hand,
44:55 the Israelites  often tested Jehovah in a bad way.
45:00 Psalm 106:14 declares:
45:05 “They gave way to their selfish desires  in the wilderness;
45:09 they tested God in the desert.”
45:13 Yes, they tested Jehovah  by their lack of faith
45:17 and by their disobedience to what they  had agreed to do in the Law covenant.
45:22 And it was all to their own detriment.
45:26 And Jesus commented on this point  of not testing Jehovah God
45:31 when he replied  to Satan at Matthew 4:7.
45:34 You recall the words:
45:36 “You must not put  Jehovah your God to the test.”
45:41 Jesus refused to do anything
45:46 that would put his life in jeopardy  or do something reckless
45:50 just to please  a challenge from the Devil.
45:54 That would be a wrong way
45:56 to put Jehovah God to the test.
46:00 However, as students of this class,  you know about Malachi.
46:05 And you know  that there is an invitation
46:08 in the Scriptures  to test Jehovah out.
46:10 Let’s look up  the scripture together,
46:13 Malachi 3:10.
46:20 It had to do  with the Israelites and tithing,
46:24 obeying Jehovah’s command.
46:27 Malachi 3:10 says:
46:29 “‘Bring the entire tithe  into the storehouse,
46:33 “‘so that there may be  food in my house;
46:35 “‘and test me out, please,  in this regard,’
46:39 “Jehovah of armies says,
46:41 “‘to see whether  I will not open to you
46:44 “‘the floodgates of the heavens
46:46 “‘and pour out on you a blessing
46:48 until there is nothing lacking.’”
46:52 That’s quite a statement.
46:54 Jehovah said:  “Test me out, please, in this regard”
46:59 —in regard to being obedient,  to accept Jehovah’s invitation,
47:04 to trust Jehovah  and his promise to bless them,
47:08 in regard to not being  tightfisted and greedy.
47:12 After all,  everything the Israelites had
47:16 came from Jehovah.
47:18 They were merely asked  to give back a small portion
47:22 of the things that Jehovah God  had provided for them.
47:27 You know, there was  no penalty for not tithing.
47:31 The arrangement actually,  when you study it,
47:34 had a lot to do  with the heart condition of the people
47:37 and their appreciation  for all of the good things
47:40 that Jehovah did for them.
47:42 Obedience would result  in blessings
47:46 —an abundance of good things,  bumper crops,
47:49 no one in the land  would be lacking.
47:52 Jehovah’s blessing would be on them  and all of their undertakings.
47:57 But think about the word picture
47:59 that Malachi paints  in the last part of verse 10.
48:03 The power of that word picture
48:06 —the floodgates  of the heavens being opened
48:08 and pouring out blessings.
48:11 What comes to your mind  when you hear that expression,
48:13 “the floodgates  of the heavens being opened”?
48:17 For me, Genesis 7:11.
48:22 And it says:  “In the 600th year of Noah’s life,
48:26 “in the second month,  on the 17th day of the month,
48:31 “on that day all the springs  of the vast watery deep burst open
48:36 and the floodgates  of the heavens were opened.”
48:40 Just imagine,
48:42 the entire planet being submerged
48:45 in blessings from Jehovah.
48:48 No one anywhere in want or in need.
48:53 That’s the promise from Jehovah.
48:55 It’s coming —and soon!
48:58 The invitation  to test Jehovah out as set forth
49:02 in Malachi 3:10 was given  to the Israelites, as we know.
49:06 It was not given to Christians,  as far as tithing is concerned.
49:11 But there is a principle  connected to tithing
49:15 that has special meaning  for us today.
49:18 Consider this quote about testing God.
49:21 It says: “You can humbly  test him in a proper sense.
49:25 “How?
49:27 He promised a blessing.”
49:29 Well, such as in Malachi 3:10:
49:31 ‘Bring the whole tithe in,  and I will bless you abundantly.’
49:34 For us,  it could be Matthew 6:33:
49:37 ‘Seek first the Kingdom  and all these other things
49:40 will be added to you.’
49:42 But the quote goes on:  “When you obey him,
49:45 “you make a test of God,  as if asking,
49:49 “‘Will he bless me?’
49:51 “In response, he puts himself  under obligation to do so,
49:55 “keeping his promise.
49:57 “Thus, God’s allowing you to ‘test him out’
50:00 “underscores your conviction  that he will bless you abundantly.”
50:05 And that’s taken from the book
50:07 Live With Jehovah’s Day in Mind,  on page 183.
50:12 The fact is that when we put Jehovah  to the test regarding his promises,
50:17 we are also putting our own faith
50:20 in his promises to the test.
50:23 This has been —and still is—
50:25 your experience.
50:27 By seeking first the Kingdom,  you Gilead students,
50:30 haven’t you been blessed abundantly?
50:32 Materially —you have what you need.
50:35 Spiritually —a superabundance of blessings
50:38 have been poured out on you.
50:41 Have you not received  blessings beyond measure
50:43 in acquaintances,  fellowship, happiness and joy
50:47 —the people now  that you’re close to in your class
50:50 and also here at Patterson?
50:53 You know what life is all about.
50:55 You know what the purpose of life is —why we’re here.
50:59 To serve God, to know Jehovah,
51:02 and to learn about our great Creator
51:04 and the way we should worship him.
51:07 And, what—  The blessings that we’re receiving
51:09 —all of the good things we have—
51:11 are just a foretaste of things to come,
51:14 things in the near future.
51:17 And, I might add,  you students are not
51:19 the only ones  who are testing Jehovah out.
51:23 I found this quote interesting  from The Watchtower about another group.
51:28 The Watchtower stated:
51:30 “Most of those who have assisted  with the construction work in New York
51:34 “could have found reasons  not to volunteer.
51:37 “However,  they put Jehovah to the test
51:40 —just as he invites all of us to do.”
51:42 And, have they not received  rich blessings from Jehovah in return?
51:46 Just ask them.  They’ll tell you.
51:49 And the last part, I like very much.
51:52 And, do we not love them  for their faith?
51:55 Absolutely!
51:58 Another group —the anointed—
52:00 test Jehovah,
52:02 and they are being tested.
52:04 Revelation 2:10:
52:07 “Prove yourself faithful even to death”
52:11 —the test, but the reward—
52:14 “and I will give you the crown of life.”
52:18 Isn’t that remarkable —the promises that God makes?
52:22 That principle applies to all of us.
52:25 When we make our dedication  and are baptized,
52:29 we vow to serve Jehovah God forever.
52:32 You know that; we know that.
52:34 But there is an interesting point  connected to that.
52:37 There is more involved  than just our person.
52:41 Consider this comment  from The Watchtower:
52:44 “From that time on,”  dedication and baptism,
52:48 “everything we have belongs to Jehovah.”
52:52 Now some may separate  their person from their possessions,
52:56 not realizing that, really,  when you give yourself to God,
53:00 it’s all you are and all that you have.
53:03 And yet, here is where the tithe,  or the principle of the tithe, comes in.
53:07 “Still,” and this is part of that quote
53:10 from The Watchtower of 2007,  December 15:
53:14 “Still, he allows us to choose
53:17 “a portion of what we have
53:20 “—a symbolic tithe—
53:22 “to use in his service.
53:24 It is whatever our circumstances allow,”
53:28 and this second part is touching,
53:31 “and our heart impels us to use.”
53:35 Isn’t that wonderful on Jehovah’s part?
53:38 He doesn’t set forth a specific requirement.
53:41 He allows us to display  our heartfelt appreciation for him
53:46 and for all the good things  that he does for us.
53:49 The heart is truly involved.
53:52 We test Jehovah God out  by doing what Proverbs 23:26 says:
53:57 “My son,  do give your heart to me,
54:01 and may your eyes  take pleasure in my ways.”
54:05 We give Jehovah God our heart,
54:07 and we give him everything else
54:09 that we have as the needs arise.
54:12 What a wonderful opportunity we have!
54:15 It gives us this opportunity of showing
54:17 how much we appreciate our great God
54:19 and how much we trust him.
54:21 And this interesting statement was made:
54:24 “To fail to give Jehovah our best
54:28 is to deprive ourselves of his blessing[s].”
54:33 Isn’t that true?
54:35 You brothers and sisters  of the 141st class of Gilead,
54:40 you are not depriving  yourselves of anything.
54:43 You have the spiritual blessings,
54:45 and you have what you need materially —no doubt about it.
54:49 And as you  continue testing Jehovah out
54:52 by responding to his promises,
54:54 the quality of your faith
54:57 will continue  to be tested and refined.
55:01 And so,  keep on testing Jehovah out;
55:06 keep on doing  the best you can to obey him,
55:10 to comply,  to show your faith in his promises.
55:14 And then you will also be tested
55:18 to your eternal joy and happiness!
55:33 Thank you, Brother Malenfant,  for that fine counsel.
55:36 We invite you all to stand now.
55:40 We’ll sing song number 43,
55:43 “Stay Awake, Stand Firm, Grow Mighty,”
55:47 song number 43.

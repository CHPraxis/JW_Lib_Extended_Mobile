00:05.380 --> 00:07.632
People often tell me, 


00:07.632 --> 00:09.967
“Why, I never talked to a person 


00:09.967 --> 00:12.637
that was 107 years old.” 


00:12.637 --> 00:14.930
And I tell them, 
“You know what? 


00:14.930 --> 00:16.000
I never did either.”


00:19.060 --> 00:21.062
I would describe Alma 


00:21.062 --> 00:23.440
as probably the most energetic 


00:23.440 --> 00:27.110
100-plus-year-old lady 
that I’ve ever met.


00:27.110 --> 00:28.778
She has, pretty much, 


00:28.778 --> 00:32.031
the whole theocratic history 
in her mind that she carries with her. 


00:32.032 --> 00:34.284
So you can ask her anything 
about the organization, 


00:34.283 --> 00:35.743
and she can be able to tell you about it 


00:35.743 --> 00:38.413
because she’s even met
 a lot of those people.


00:38.413 --> 00:42.250
We read about it, but she lived it. 
She’s amazing. 


00:42.250 --> 00:46.000
Even though she’s 107, 
she has an incredible memory.


00:47.172 --> 00:50.092
I go back quite a ways. 


00:50.092 --> 00:52.885
When I was very young, 
ten years old, 


00:52.885 --> 00:57.000
we saw the “Photo-Drama of Creation.” 


00:58.892 --> 01:01.644
And it was just packed with people. 


01:01.643 --> 01:05.565
They were even standing in the back. 


01:05.565 --> 01:09.652
We were so thrilled. 
We never forgot it. 


01:09.652 --> 01:13.000
And we realized 
that we found the truth. 


01:14.657 --> 01:17.244
My father left the church 


01:17.243 --> 01:20.496
and he became 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


01:20.497 --> 01:24.000
and they were called Bible Students 
at that time. 


01:25.210 --> 01:28.963
In the early days, 
we went to special conventions, 


01:28.963 --> 01:31.800
and some places, 
they had a big field 


01:31.800 --> 01:35.303
where they put the cars 
and they set up their tents. 


01:35.303 --> 01:38.473
They even named different streets. 


01:38.473 --> 01:41.000
It was just like a little city. 


01:42.518 --> 01:46.688
I was really thrilled 
to see Brother Rutherford speak 


01:46.688 --> 01:49.000
at the conventions I attended. 


01:50.443 --> 01:55.030
I got married to Harold Miller in 1931. 


01:55.030 --> 01:58.242
That was when the depression 
was going on, 


01:58.242 --> 02:00.745
and times were very difficult. 


02:00.745 --> 02:04.248
Everything was scarce. 


02:04.248 --> 02:06.918
There were no jobs to be had. 


02:06.918 --> 02:09.336
Food was rationed. 


02:09.337 --> 02:11.589
People were really hungry. 


02:11.588 --> 02:14.758
And they moved in any little shack 


02:14.758 --> 02:19.000
that they could just to get by. 


02:20.640 --> 02:22.933
We didn’t have anything. 


02:22.933 --> 02:26.855
And we couldn’t drive the car, 


02:26.855 --> 02:30.483
so we used to have a little white horse


02:30.483 --> 02:33.000
—the name was Lou. 


02:34.403 --> 02:38.908
And we went out witnessing 
with the horse and buggy. 


02:38.908 --> 02:43.000
She took us all over the place, 
far distances.


02:44.663 --> 02:47.833
They would take this buggy, 
and they would go 


02:47.833 --> 02:49.918
20-30 miles in one direction;


02:49.918 --> 02:52.005
20-30 miles the other direction. 


02:52.005 --> 02:54.007
All the hard work that they put forth 


02:54.007 --> 02:58.000
has resulted 
in several congregations in the area.


02:59.928 --> 03:03.683
We used to carry that magazine bag 


03:03.683 --> 03:07.020
when we were witnessing
for awhile there. 


03:07.020 --> 03:09.813
And so we put it
around the horse’s neck, 


03:09.813 --> 03:14.151
so the horse was taking part 
in our witnessing. 


03:14.152 --> 03:16.989
People knew 
who was coming when they saw 


03:16.988 --> 03:20.908
the little white horse
come into their yard. 


03:20.908 --> 03:23.493
Sometimes it was cold, 


03:23.493 --> 03:26.746
and I remember wearing two coats. 


03:26.747 --> 03:29.250
Yeah, it was tiresome, 


03:29.250 --> 03:32.170
but we were young.


03:32.170 --> 03:35.507
They would just go out 
regardless of rain or shine 


03:35.507 --> 03:37.967
or whatever was going on at the time, 
and they didn’t have a car. 


03:37.967 --> 03:40.052
And to me, that’s amazing 
because we get so used to 


03:40.052 --> 03:42.305
the conveniences
—I guess you could call it—


03:42.305 --> 03:44.307
the coffee breaks, 
the cars, and everything. 


03:44.307 --> 03:48.854
It’s like, well, 
if Alma can do it, surely I can do it.


03:48.853 --> 03:51.771
One time,
Harold went out witnessing, 


03:51.772 --> 03:54.900
and 50 years later, 
he talked to the same man. 


03:54.900 --> 03:57.903
He said, “50 years ago, 


03:57.903 --> 04:01.740
“there was a young guy 
that came through here 


04:01.740 --> 04:03.743
“riding on horseback 


04:03.743 --> 04:07.163
and telling people that,” 
he said, 


04:07.163 --> 04:09.748
“I think it’s ‘Armaggigon,’ 


04:09.748 --> 04:12.043
he said was coming soon.” 


04:12.043 --> 04:15.045
And he remembered 
Harold riding horseback 


04:15.045 --> 04:17.298
50 years ago in that territory, 


04:17.298 --> 04:20.551
and he got there again. 


04:20.552 --> 04:23.930
And that happened 
a couple times more. 


04:23.930 --> 04:27.000
So it was a long life of witnessing.


04:32.230 --> 04:35.065
Alma is so zealous for the ministry. 


04:35.065 --> 04:38.068
She does not like not-at-homes. 


04:38.068 --> 04:40.988
She wants to talk to people.


04:40.988 --> 04:43.240
Yeah, I enjoy the ministry. 


04:43.240 --> 04:48.788
I go out as much as I can 
in my old age. 


04:48.788 --> 04:52.041
We want to help the people 
to see the truth. 


04:52.042 --> 04:55.000
There’s no greater joy. 


04:58.588 --> 05:01.675
I try to read the publications, 


05:01.675 --> 05:04.000
so I have a reading machine. 


05:06.597 --> 05:09.434
The letters come right out of the screen, 


05:09.433 --> 05:13.311
and I can study all my lessons. 


05:13.312 --> 05:16.000
I would be lost without it. 


05:17.400 --> 05:20.987
It helps me to keep up 
in present truth.


05:20.987 --> 05:24.000
What does dedication mean? 


05:25.408 --> 05:27.493
Sister Miller, please.


05:27.493 --> 05:30.161
Dedication means that. . .


05:30.162 --> 05:32.832
Some young ones might be concerned 
about what they should do 


05:32.832 --> 05:34.834
with their life, 
what choices they should make. 


05:34.833 --> 05:36.876
Well, here we see an example 
of somebody who has served Jehovah 


05:36.877 --> 05:39.005
for over 100 years. 


05:39.005 --> 05:41.757
And we see that she’s happy 
and has no regrets with her life. 


05:41.757 --> 05:44.000
And that’s an example 
that we want to imitate.


05:45.678 --> 05:48.681
Well, giving my life to Jehovah, 


05:48.682 --> 05:51.000
that’s the best thing 
I could do for myself. 


05:53.643 --> 05:57.231
If I have any advice 
for young ones today, 


05:57.232 --> 06:01.735
I would say 
to keep on in the truth. 


06:01.735 --> 06:05.573
They have a whole world before them 


06:05.573 --> 06:07.783
to serve Jehovah


06:07.783 --> 06:23.925
—something that endures forever.

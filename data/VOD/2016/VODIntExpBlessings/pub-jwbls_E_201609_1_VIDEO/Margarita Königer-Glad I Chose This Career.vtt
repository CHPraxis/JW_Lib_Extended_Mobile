00:01.051 --> 00:03.887
Sister Margarita Königer has seen

00:03.887 --> 00:06.556
the growth of the Kingdom work 
all her life.

00:06.556 --> 00:10.493
She has served 
as a missionary since 1966,

00:10.493 --> 00:12.562
and we met her in Hungary,

00:12.562 --> 00:16.232
where she has now served 
for about nine years.

05:51.401 --> 05:54.670
In the 50 years 
since she graduated from Gilead,

05:54.670 --> 05:58.074
Sister Königer has learned 
seven languages

05:58.074 --> 06:00.977
and has served 
in five different countries.

06:00.977 --> 06:04.280
And recently, 
she received a new assignment

06:04.280 --> 06:07.784
—the Chinese field 
in Munich, Germany.

06:07.784 --> 06:12.055
Daily reading 
and meditating on God’s Word, the Bible,

06:12.055 --> 06:14.824
has given her 
the strength she needs

06:14.824 --> 06:29.933
to continue with joy 
in her missionary assignment.

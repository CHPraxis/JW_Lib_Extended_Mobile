00:03.148 --> 00:06.735
Well, everybody here 
calls me Honey, but my name 


00:06.735 --> 00:08.612
is Esther Lozano. 


00:08.612 --> 00:12.074
And I was born in Fresno, California, 


00:12.073 --> 00:14.326
in 1919. 


00:14.327 --> 00:18.580
I was baptized in 1935, 


00:18.580 --> 00:22.543
and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed 
my service to Jehovah. 


00:22.543 --> 00:25.711
I became a special pioneer, 


00:25.712 --> 00:28.882
and then they called me to Gilead. 


00:28.882 --> 00:32.637
I was in the fourth class of Gilead. 


00:32.637 --> 00:35.805
That was in 1944. 


00:35.805 --> 00:38.975
When I left my assignment as a special, 


00:38.975 --> 00:43.563
I didn’t even know how it was to study, 
but this was beautiful 


00:43.563 --> 00:47.400
how Gilead prepared us 
for what was in the future. 


00:47.400 --> 00:49.820
Right after Gilead, 


00:49.820 --> 00:53.240
we went to Brooklyn Bethel for two years


00:53.240 --> 00:55.533
—Esther Lopez and I—


00:55.533 --> 00:57.786
then I was sent to Mexico.


00:57.787 --> 01:02.040
I came in 1947, 
and I’m still here. 


01:02.040 --> 01:07.755
So that makes more than 68 years 
I’ve been in Mexico. 


01:07.755 --> 01:11.258
When I arrived,
there were 7 Bethelites, 


01:11.258 --> 01:13.260
and there were 22 missionaries. 


01:13.260 --> 01:15.262
We all lived right at the branch; 


01:15.262 --> 01:17.807
it was a branch-missionary home. 


01:17.807 --> 01:20.225
The progress in Mexico 


01:20.225 --> 01:24.897
really is because of the families 
being united. 


01:24.897 --> 01:29.610
And when you get 
the husband and wife together, 


01:29.610 --> 01:33.000
then the whole family 
comes in the truth.


01:34.657 --> 01:38.660
In 1961, Sister Esther Lozano 
preached to our grandparents. 


01:38.660 --> 01:40.828
My grandfather first got interested 


01:40.828 --> 01:43.248
through the book
From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.


01:43.248 --> 01:44.333
When I placed the book 


01:44.333 --> 01:47.168
with his wife
and she gave it to him, 


01:47.168 --> 01:51.090
he decided that that’s what 
he was looking for. 


01:51.090 --> 01:55.427
He said, 
“Well, when can I be baptized?”


01:55.427 --> 01:57.680
Three visits later, 


01:57.680 --> 02:00.015
a study was started
with the entire family.


02:00.015 --> 02:03.602
And the oldest son was only 13. 


02:03.602 --> 02:05.604
He said, 
“I’m getting baptized too!” 


02:05.603 --> 02:09.065
About a year ago, he came 


02:09.065 --> 02:13.570
and brought me a letter 
and told me how happy he was 


02:13.570 --> 02:16.907
that I had gone to their home 


02:16.907 --> 02:19.869
and preached to them. 


02:19.868 --> 02:23.330
And that was 
a happy experience of my life.


02:23.330 --> 02:24.707
Today, in our family, 


02:24.707 --> 02:27.752
we are 23 Witnesses 
spread over four generations, 


02:27.752 --> 02:30.045
and now my brother 
and I are serving here


02:30.045 --> 02:32.000
at the Central America branch.


02:33.507 --> 02:35.675
Oh, I forgot to talk about my husband. 


02:35.675 --> 02:38.595
He was the branch overseer at that time. 


02:38.595 --> 02:42.892
We were there 
in the same branch for five years. 


02:42.892 --> 02:45.852
We got to know each other, 
but I didn’t pay attention to him 


02:45.852 --> 02:48.897
because I was always in the service. 


02:48.897 --> 02:52.150
And so,
I don’t know when he decided 


02:52.150 --> 02:54.737
he wanted to get married 
because I know 


02:54.737 --> 02:56.905
that wasn’t his goal in life. 


02:56.905 --> 02:58.657
And so I wrote Brother Knorr 


02:58.657 --> 03:01.702
and asked him if he was surprised 


03:01.702 --> 03:03.704
to hear that we 
were going to be married. 


03:03.703 --> 03:05.413
Then he did write me back 


03:05.413 --> 03:09.793
and also said, 
well this is what he said in the letter: 


03:09.793 --> 03:13.213
‘You’re always jolly 
and talkative when I’m around. 


03:13.213 --> 03:14.296
‘On the other hand, 


03:14.297 --> 03:17.134
‘Brother Lozano is so quiet. 


03:17.133 --> 03:21.513
‘I must say,
it is an interesting combination. 


03:21.513 --> 03:25.141
‘Both of you together 
can serve him and aid 


03:25.142 --> 03:27.144
one another in your true worship.’ 


03:27.143 --> 03:31.606
This is one of my greatest treasures, 


03:31.607 --> 03:34.359
having that letter from Brother Knorr.


03:34.358 --> 03:37.905
Then when Rudy died, 


03:37.905 --> 03:40.740
I didn’t dwell on that. 


03:40.740 --> 03:43.868
I remembered 
I made my dedication to Jehovah, 


03:43.868 --> 03:46.413
and I know that he would want me


03:46.413 --> 03:48.415
to put that first in my life. 


03:48.415 --> 03:52.252
So I did not really suffer 


03:52.252 --> 03:54.337
that much about his death 


03:54.337 --> 03:57.174
because I became even more involved 


03:57.173 --> 04:01.000
in theocratic activities.


04:03.305 --> 04:05.557
I’m in the Correspondence. 


04:05.557 --> 04:10.062
But I’m at work 
about an hour and a half in the morning 


04:10.062 --> 04:13.065
and an hour and a half 
in the afternoon 


04:13.065 --> 04:15.483
and the rest of the time 


04:15.483 --> 04:18.236
I’m studying here in the room. 


04:18.237 --> 04:20.572
I’m so pleased that I’m still able 


04:20.572 --> 04:23.075
to go to the morning text, 


04:23.075 --> 04:26.745
and I have a part in the service. 


04:26.745 --> 04:31.000
I have two studies 
that I conduct every week.


04:34.462 --> 04:37.297
It’s such a pleasure
to be with people 


04:37.297 --> 04:41.969
that have dedicated
their lives to Jehovah. 


04:41.968 --> 04:44.386
And that’s what makes me happy 
because I know 


04:44.387 --> 04:46.640
Jehovah counts them 


04:46.640 --> 04:50.000
as his precious sons and daughters.


04:52.855 --> 04:54.607
I don’t know why, 


04:54.607 --> 04:56.359
but many of the missionaries 


04:56.358 --> 04:57.985
have come up to me and told me 


04:57.985 --> 05:00.195
that I’ve been 
an encouragement to them, 


05:00.195 --> 05:03.532
and really, 
they are the ones that encourage me. 


05:03.532 --> 05:07.160
It’s because I had 
such beautiful examples 


05:07.160 --> 05:11.498
to follow in all these years.


05:11.498 --> 05:15.168
And all I can say 
is thanks to Jehovah 


05:15.168 --> 05:37.461
for this great privilege 
of serving him.

00:03 I have learned  that Jehovah can support me
00:06 under any circumstances.
00:13 I was born and raised  in Karaganda, Kazakhstan.
00:18 When I was 25,
00:21 I lost my job.
00:25 A special pioneer brother  from my congregation asked me,
00:28 “Why don’t you  use this opportunity
00:31 to start pioneering?”
00:33 But I wasn’t sure  if someone like me could pioneer.
00:38 Because he said, “Don’t worry,
00:40 I’ll support you and help you,”
00:43 I decided to give it a try.
00:45 And that brother kept his word.
00:49 He worked with me  and helped me in my service.
00:53 Sometime later,
00:55 I was encouraged  to apply for MTS
00:58 by our circuit overseer  who had graduated
01:01 from the first class in Russia.
01:03 Even though I thought  it was beyond my ability,
01:06 I listened to him  and was able to attend
01:09 the fourth class.
01:11 Before graduation,
01:13 a brother  on the Branch Committee asked me
01:16 if I would be willing  to serve in Mongolia
01:18 as a special pioneer.
01:21 Immediately, I said yes
01:24 because I was ready  to serve anywhere.
01:26 But when I realized
01:28 how much responsibility
01:30 comes with serving in a foreign assignment,
01:33 I started to wonder  if I could serve in Mongolia
01:36 with my limited experience.
01:41 After graduating
01:42 in February 1999,
01:44 I arrived in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
01:48 It was about -30°C (-22°F).
01:51 There was no snow, just a dust storm.
01:54 I’d never seen anything like it before.
01:58 At that time, 17 publishers  were serving in Mongolia.
02:03 When preaching,
02:05 I would recite the introduction,
02:07 and then a local publisher  would continue the conversation.
02:13 Back then,  everyone invited us in,
02:16 offered us tea and candy,  and listened to us.
02:20 But I was upset because I  couldn’t understand everything.
02:30 Often, I had to work alone
02:33 in the ministry  without knowing the language.
02:40 I supplicated
02:42 Jehovah for courage
02:44 and often reflected that,  right at that moment,
02:47 it was like there was  no one else preaching
02:49 in all of Mongolia but me
02:51 and that the angels  were watching over me.
02:54 This thinking gave me the strength
02:57 to continue preaching.
03:09 In 2001, I married a wonderful sister, Norie.
03:15 Jehovah truly blesses our efforts  when we give him
03:19 our best  and pray intensely.
03:22 He has helped me many times
03:25 and has patiently trained me.
03:28 And because of that,
03:31 I’ve been able to serve here
03:33 for 17 years.
03:35 I’m very grateful that we
03:38 have been able to help 20 people
03:40 come to know Jehovah.
03:44 Knowing that people, like me,
03:47 with little experience
03:49 can be used by Jehovah  and his organization,
03:51 helps me appreciate
03:54 Jehovah’s mercy and patience.
04:02 I thank Jehovah  from the bottom of my heart.

00:03.940 --> 00:06.443
I have learned 
that Jehovah can support me 


00:06.443 --> 00:09.000
under any circumstances. 


00:13.158 --> 00:17.000
I was born and raised 
in Karaganda, Kazakhstan. 


00:18.497 --> 00:21.000
When I was 25, 


00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I lost my job. 


00:25.212 --> 00:28.799
A special pioneer brother 
from my congregation asked me, 


00:28.798 --> 00:31.051
“Why don’t you 
use this opportunity


00:31.052 --> 00:33.929
to start pioneering?” 


00:33.928 --> 00:37.000
But I wasn’t sure 
if someone like me could pioneer.


00:38.725 --> 00:40.978
Because he said, “Don’t worry, 


00:40.978 --> 00:43.396
I’ll support you and help you,” 


00:43.397 --> 00:45.900
I decided to give it a try. 


00:45.900 --> 00:49.152
And that brother kept his word. 


00:49.152 --> 00:53.949
He worked with me 
and helped me in my service. 


00:53.948 --> 00:55.450
Sometime later, 


00:55.450 --> 00:58.453
I was encouraged 
to apply for MTS 


00:58.453 --> 01:01.206
by our circuit overseer 
who had graduated 


01:01.207 --> 01:03.542
from the first class in Russia. 


01:03.542 --> 01:06.795
Even though I thought 
it was beyond my ability, 


01:06.795 --> 01:09.257
I listened to him 
and was able to attend 


01:09.257 --> 01:11.925
the fourth class.


01:11.925 --> 01:13.927
Before graduation, 


01:13.927 --> 01:16.180
a brother 
on the Branch Committee asked me 


01:16.180 --> 01:18.807
if I would be willing 
to serve in Mongolia 


01:18.807 --> 01:21.852
as a special pioneer. 


01:21.852 --> 01:24.020
Immediately, I said yes 


01:24.020 --> 01:26.607
because I was ready 
to serve anywhere. 


01:26.607 --> 01:28.650
But when I realized 


01:28.650 --> 01:30.777
how much responsibility 


01:30.777 --> 01:33.447
comes with serving
in a foreign assignment, 


01:33.447 --> 01:36.659
I started to wonder 
if I could serve in Mongolia 


01:36.658 --> 01:39.000
with my limited experience.


01:41.163 --> 01:42.413
After graduating 


01:42.413 --> 01:44.625
in February 1999, 


01:44.625 --> 01:47.000
I arrived in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. 


01:48.462 --> 01:51.257
It was about -30°C (-22°F). 


01:51.257 --> 01:54.510
There was no snow,
just a dust storm. 


01:54.510 --> 01:58.847
I’d never seen anything like it before. 


01:58.847 --> 02:03.394
At that time, 17 publishers 
were serving in Mongolia. 


02:03.393 --> 02:05.395
When preaching, 


02:05.395 --> 02:07.648
I would recite the introduction, 


02:07.648 --> 02:11.000
and then a local publisher 
would continue the conversation. 


02:13.195 --> 02:16.365
Back then, 
everyone invited us in, 


02:16.365 --> 02:20.368
offered us tea and candy, 
and listened to us. 


02:20.368 --> 02:25.000
But I was upset because I 
couldn’t understand everything.


02:30.545 --> 02:33.048
Often, I had to work alone 


02:33.048 --> 02:37.000
in the ministry 
without knowing the language. 


02:40.763 --> 02:42.056
I supplicated 


02:42.057 --> 02:44.059
Jehovah for courage 


02:44.058 --> 02:47.103
and often reflected that, 
right at that moment, 


02:47.103 --> 02:49.606
it was like there was 
no one else preaching 


02:49.607 --> 02:51.942
in all of Mongolia but me 


02:51.942 --> 02:54.820
and that the angels 
were watching over me. 


02:54.820 --> 02:57.238
This thinking gave me the strength 


02:57.238 --> 03:00.000
to continue preaching.


03:09.208 --> 03:14.000
In 2001, I married
a wonderful sister, Norie. 


03:15.548 --> 03:19.301
Jehovah truly blesses our efforts 
when we give him 


03:19.302 --> 03:22.555
our best 
and pray intensely. 


03:22.555 --> 03:25.642
He has helped me many times 


03:25.642 --> 03:28.979
and has patiently trained me. 


03:28.978 --> 03:31.273
And because of that, 


03:31.273 --> 03:33.316
I’ve been able to serve here 


03:33.317 --> 03:35.944
for 17 years. 


03:35.943 --> 03:38.530
I’m very grateful that we 


03:38.530 --> 03:40.532
have been able to help 20 people 


03:40.532 --> 03:43.000
come to know Jehovah.


03:44.828 --> 03:47.246
Knowing that people, like me, 


03:47.247 --> 03:49.249
with little experience 


03:49.248 --> 03:51.960
can be used by Jehovah 
and his organization, 


03:51.960 --> 03:54.463
helps me appreciate 


03:54.463 --> 03:57.000
Jehovah’s mercy and patience. 


04:02.637 --> 04:25.140
I thank Jehovah 
from the bottom of my heart.

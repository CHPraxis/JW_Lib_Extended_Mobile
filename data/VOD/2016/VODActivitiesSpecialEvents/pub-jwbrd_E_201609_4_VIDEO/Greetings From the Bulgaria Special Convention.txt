00:19 For me, this is a historical moment.
00:22 I was very worried  about how we will succeed.
00:24 But you can see that this is not possible  just by people’s efforts.
00:29 The angels are helping,  and Jehovah gives his spirit.
00:32 Actually, this went  beyond our dreams, what we get.
00:38 Of course, there have been  many efforts put into it,
00:41 but it was worth it.
00:44 And we are very thankful
00:47 to the Governing Body  that they made this possible for us.
00:56 We welcome the 60 brothers  and sisters who symbolized
01:01 their dedication to Jehovah  who have now joined us
01:04 as footstep followers of Jesus.
01:10 Thank you, friends,  for all the love and the kindness
01:13 you’ve shown us here in Sofia.
01:16 It’s a great privilege to be here  with all of you and feeling the love
01:21 that Jehovah has for us  and for everyone of you as well.
01:27 I think that the best gift  that we received
01:30 from our brothers  was their smiles
01:32 of happiness.
01:37 We saw how the brothers and sisters,
01:39 with all their hearts,  gave their time
01:42 and were thinking about how to make  the delegates feel welcome.
01:47 To host this special event  is really a huge privilege for us.
01:51 Thank you all for coming.
01:54 We are happy, and we look forward  to seeing each other again.
02:03 We love you.
02:04 Thank you for your gifts.
02:15 I think the question we all had  in the beginning was, Will we make it?
02:21 Still today, I don’t really understand  how it worked out.
02:25 But we used everyone, everywhere.
02:31 We knew that the brothers here
02:33 in Bulgaria had less materially,  but we also saw
02:37 that they had a big heart.
02:38 Many different languages
02:40 are spoken here,  but the spirit is the same.
02:43 We experienced what  an international brotherhood really is.
02:53 The local congregations  helped a lot.
02:56 They prepared  a pleasant surprise for every tour.
03:01 At the end, we saw joy
03:04 and happiness on the brothers’ faces.
03:08 For being here for the week,  it really had such an impact on us.
03:12 It’s been wonderful.
03:14 It’s been a faith-building experience,
03:16 and it really brings us together  as a worldwide organization,
03:18 and we’re privileged  to be a part of it.
03:23 So when we follow instruction  from the organization
03:27 regarding the ministry
03:29 and we think  about the brothers’ happiness
03:31 and the joy in the ministry,
03:34 we can see the result.
03:39 We saw that in the end,  Jehovah opened large doors.
03:44 We managed to accommodate  our precious delegates
03:46 in the best hotels,  and we saw how Jehovah
03:49 can make the impossible, possible.
03:54 These three days,  we met our “relatives” from Bulgaria,
03:59 from the United States,
04:01 from Macedonia,  from Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova
04:05 and we wouldn’t change  this for anything else.
04:14 Some of the joyful tears  we will shed in the new world,
04:17 we have experienced here.
04:19 The memory of this is beautiful.  Thank you!
04:23 We are truly a family.
04:25 Da!
04:46 The feeling I had with this event  is just like we had the impression
04:51 to walk for a few moments  in the new world.
04:55 This is the way I felt.
04:56 We would like to help you learn  how you can be on Jesus’ side,
05:01 on his side,  when he completely conquers the world!
05:41 We look forward to being with you  at a convention in the new world.

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For sure, Maltese people 
are a friendly people. 

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.578 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s in our tradition 
to be like that, 

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the Christian love 
that Jehovah 

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎wants us 
to grow inside, 

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that will triple the effect.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In October 2015, 
the time finally arrived 

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the 650 publishers 
on the island of Malta 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to host over 1,500 delegates 

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:38.684 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the “Imitate Jesus” Special Convention. 

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This would allow for a unique 

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.898 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and unprecedented shout 
of praise to Jehovah.

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the work in Malta 
was for a long time 

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎rather restricted, 
and there was a lot of opposition. 

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, with this special convention, 

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:59.079 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the brothers make an impact 
on the people here. 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some of them were not aware 
that we are 

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Maltese are very impressed 
with numbers. 

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So now when they see 
all these numbers 

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and all this activity, 
they’re going to change their whole minds 

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about us, and it’s going to open 
their hearts and minds to our message.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As well as making 
a positive impact in the field, 

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the delegates got to visit 
the nearby isle of Gozo 

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and have an interchange 
of encouragement 

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:32.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with one of the territory’s most 
isolated congregations.

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We were looking forward to this 
for over a year now, 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to have the reality

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—you see the brothers here, 
you can talk to them, 

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can hug them, 
you see the love, 

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the sincerity—
and that’s what makes the difference.

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Hospitality was shown by means 
of the evening entertainment program, 

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which not only shared the local culture 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but glorified Jehovah 
and the many treasures found in his Word.

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The children loved every bit 
of this thing. 

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They even said: 
“What are we going to do when this finishes? 

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“We loved being with Jehovah’s children. 

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:34.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s so different than being 
with the children in school.”

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By means of the convention, 
I have felt closer to Jehovah, 

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I felt that I had Jehovah’s spirit. 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And, yes, I also met many other children 
from different congregations, 

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I really enjoyed that.

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The brotherly love continued 

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as other tours were hosted 
all across the beautiful island, 

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:12.671 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎allowing the visitors to see Malta 
and the Maltese people to see the visitors.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“After we made it to safety, 

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:21.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“we learned that the island 
was called Malta. 

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:25.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And the foreign-speaking people 
showed us extraordinary kindness. 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They kindled a fire 
and received all of us kindly.”

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We extend a warm welcome 
to all those present. 

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:42.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We would like to give a special welcome 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.496 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the 1,550 delegates 

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎coming from Australia, Portugal, Spain, 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.502 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Greece, Israel, and the United States!

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I found the truth in 1960. 

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it was difficult 
at that time 

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:10.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because there was no one 
in the truth. 

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I saw this crowd here, 

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:19.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was filled with joy 
seeing how Jehovah has made it grow.

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:28.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was here in 1980 as a missionary. 

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:30.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We only had 82 people here. 

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:32.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And now look at it! 

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎From that little, little group, 
we are now huge! 

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that makes me very happy.

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It reminds us of a prophecy 
in the Hebrew Scriptures 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.014 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not to ‘despise the day 
of small beginnings.’ 

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:49.935 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It doesn’t matter whether there are 
many publishers or a few. 

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The fact is that Jehovah 
through his holy spirit 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can do things that we 
are not even imagining 

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that there will be an increase 
in Kingdom proclaimers.

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.826 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎With the special convention now over, 

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a lot of us take a deep breath 
and say, “Ah, it’s done.” 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But it’s not time to stop; 
now is the beginning.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:16.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The brothers and sisters 
give us a lot of encouragement. 

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:21.008 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When they came, 
they brought along their love as well. 

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:25.804 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And seeing all this 
makes you even want to give more. 

00:05:25.804 --> 00:05:29.474 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Doing this for Jehovah, 
it’s rewarding, it is, truly. 

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:30.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Scriptures are right.

This past summer,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was my privilege to attend

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large regional convention

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters 
from Sweden, Denmark,

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Norway, Iceland,
Greenland, the Faeroe Islands,

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:20.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the Swedish circuit in Finland

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were present at this historic convention.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While this event was
a great spiritual boost  for the Witnesses,

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of you may know

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the majority of the local residents

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not believe in God.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many consider themselves atheists.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the conduct

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and professionalism
of Jehovah’s people

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a great impact.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, the branch offices were merged.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the result was a new branch office
—Scandinavia branch.

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:16.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We thought
that if all the brothers in Scandinavia

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
should benefit from this unity,

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:20.142 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
then we had to have
a convention in Stockholm.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.233 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Here we were allowed
to arrange a regional convention,

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.860 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but one of enormous size.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:34.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having 50,000 brothers
gathered together for three days

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the largest theocratic event
ever in Scandinavia.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we began to look for a facility,

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.334 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we found Friends Arena.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think we have had
a very good collaboration.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times I have thought:

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wow, these people working for you

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:03.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as the organizers
of infrastructure, logistics, and so on,

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should work with them more often.”

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.820 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The use of technology
has been the greatest challenge.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, with such a large project,
many details have to come together.

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are four languages
and three sign languages,

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all these have to be tied together
and work at the same time.

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:26.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been a challenge, but we made it work.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:28.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
All the experts argued

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:30.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it would be impossible

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:34.133 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to have four languages at one arena.

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:11.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Early in the morning,
families with children and strollers arrive.

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:16.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some elderly publishers
get up at 5:30 a.m. or 6:00 a.m.,

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:19.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting on the bus
to be here in good time.

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must be joyful
seeing all the people

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciating the spiritual program

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all their efforts.

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:37.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the song started,

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
50,000 were in place here,

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was our proof that all the hard work
in preparation was successful.

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And actually,
I shed a tear of joy.

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:47.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did.

00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the managers at the arena said:

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have to stand and listen to the song

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you will never again hear

00:03:56.215 --> 00:04:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a choir of 50,000 singing at the same time.

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just have to listen to it.”

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.067 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, I want to thank you
for how well it worked out.

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:18.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normally, at arrangements of this size,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are using an event agency,
but you have done this for many years,

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:25.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have done a fantastic job,
so it was not needed.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been very professional
and have knowledge of the business industry.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:34.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have told the contact persons
I have been involved with

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they should start up an event agency
because it has worked out so smoothly.

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can warmly recommend
other cities to welcome you.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have been very well-organized,

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:52.312 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we have not had to put much effort
into the arrangement.

00:04:52.312 --> 00:04:55.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It requires good organization

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get all things to fall into place.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously,
having so many tourists in Stockholm

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the same time benefits the whole city.

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:10.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I looked at the number of hotel bookings,
and there are not many rooms available.

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:13.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many who can learn
from the work of the logistics,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how to get 50,000 people

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the area at the same time.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is something we can learn a lot from.

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:25.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met with the police this afternoon,

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:27.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said that they have never seen

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:31.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such a well-organized event, ever.

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:36.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing how everything has been successful,

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is a clear evidence of Jehovah’s help.

00:05:45.532 --> 00:05:48.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is a great confirmation of one’s faith.

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:51.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you really see faith in action.

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you see the foundation
for a new and better world.

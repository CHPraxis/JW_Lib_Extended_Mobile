00:06.622 --> 00:09.092
How did we come to Africa? 


00:09.092 --> 00:12.662
It was because we went through Gilead. 


00:12.662 --> 00:15.532
We attended the 47th class of Gilead, 


00:15.532 --> 00:17.934
and that was in 1969. 


00:17.933 --> 00:19.935
Our first assignment 


00:19.935 --> 00:23.105
was in the Belgian Congo, 
which is now 


00:23.105 --> 00:26.675
the Democratic Republic of Congo. 


00:26.675 --> 00:30.000
When we got our assignment, 
we were not overjoyed. 


00:31.247 --> 00:35.352
All we’d heard 
about the Congo was war, 


00:35.352 --> 00:38.087
atrocities, mercenaries. 


00:38.087 --> 00:43.927
So we weren’t excited. 
In fact, Susanne cried all night. 


00:43.927 --> 00:46.595
But we had promised to serve 


00:46.595 --> 00:48.665
Jehovah with our whole soul, 


00:48.665 --> 00:51.067
and we had said, “Here we are! 


00:51.067 --> 00:52.635
Send us.” 


00:52.635 --> 00:56.000
And so we accepted the assignment.


00:57.173 --> 01:00.643
When we first arrived 
in the small mining town in Katanga, 


01:00.643 --> 01:04.046
we were arrested 
as soon as we got off the plane. 


01:04.047 --> 01:06.784
Then there was nobody to meet us. 


01:06.783 --> 01:09.918
The telegram, 
which had been sent three days earlier, 


01:09.918 --> 01:11.921
arrived on the same plane. 


01:11.922 --> 01:13.924
The missionaries had all returned 


01:13.923 --> 01:15.091
to their home countries 


01:15.092 --> 01:17.227
for the international conventions. 


01:17.227 --> 01:20.197
So when we eventually arrived 
at the missionary home, 


01:20.197 --> 01:22.599
it was empty, 
and there were 


01:22.598 --> 01:26.535
only big, dead cockroaches 
and bullet holes in the walls. 


01:26.535 --> 01:29.472
So we were alone for three weeks 


01:29.472 --> 01:32.675
until the other missionaries arrived.


01:32.675 --> 01:34.910
The next hurdle to overcome 


01:34.910 --> 01:38.313
was to get used to a complete new culture 


01:38.313 --> 01:41.750
and also to learn two languages. 


01:41.750 --> 01:44.087
Communication with our families 


01:44.087 --> 01:46.089
was also a problem


01:46.088 --> 01:48.958
—there was no Internet, 
no phones. 


01:48.958 --> 01:52.795
The only way was by letters, 
and it took three weeks 


01:52.795 --> 01:55.932
or almost four weeks 
for a letter to get to our families 


01:55.932 --> 01:58.000
and another four weeks 
to get a reply.


01:59.035 --> 02:01.237
For years, we traveled 


02:01.237 --> 02:05.742
in the bush doing 
circuit and district work. 


02:05.742 --> 02:08.410
This meant living in the villages 


02:08.410 --> 02:10.413
in mud huts. 


02:10.413 --> 02:13.048
And so we would get 
water from the river 


02:13.048 --> 02:15.050
and use candles 


02:15.050 --> 02:18.120
for our power 
(our electricity there) 


02:18.120 --> 02:22.592
and charcoal 
to do our cooking on. 


02:22.592 --> 02:25.262
We had toilets outside
—a hole in the ground. 


02:25.262 --> 02:28.000
It was real village life. 


02:31.000 --> 02:33.570
To get there, 
we had to travel on roads 


02:33.570 --> 02:35.838
that were often almost nonexistent 


02:35.838 --> 02:39.841
or very, very bad
—rocky, deep sand, 


02:39.842 --> 02:41.644
muddy. 


02:41.643 --> 02:43.513
When it was muddy, 
it was deep mud,


02:43.513 --> 02:45.000
and we’d get stuck. 


02:48.183 --> 02:50.953
In fact, one trip we did, 
2,000 kilometers 


02:50.953 --> 02:52.955
took us ten days. 


02:52.955 --> 02:55.023
A lot of it was sand. 


02:55.023 --> 02:58.026
And one day, 
we only went 70 kilometers, 


02:58.027 --> 03:01.497
and we had to dig 
the vehicle out 12 times. 


03:01.497 --> 03:04.600
But we got there 
with Jehovah’s help. 


03:04.600 --> 03:06.835
And as far as we were concerned, 
this was missionary life


03:06.835 --> 03:08.838
—this was real missionary life. 


03:08.838 --> 03:10.906
This was what we’d come to do. 


03:10.907 --> 03:13.000
We felt closer to Jehovah 


03:14.077 --> 03:17.280
when we were in the bush 
under those difficult circumstances 


03:17.280 --> 03:19.548
than we ever have. 


03:19.548 --> 03:20.616
It was great! 


03:20.617 --> 03:24.000
We loved it, 
and it’s really a big part of our life.


03:27.257 --> 03:31.394
Some ask us if we ever desired 
to return to Europe. 


03:31.393 --> 03:33.730
Truthfully, yes. 


03:33.730 --> 03:37.000
But only very momentarily.


03:38.067 --> 03:40.804
The work was under ban 
for ten years. 


03:40.803 --> 03:43.973
To carry on a religion 
that was banned was a prison sentence 


03:43.973 --> 03:47.243
of between five 
and ten years in prison. 


03:47.243 --> 03:48.678
And we’d been caught 


03:48.678 --> 03:51.000
carrying on a religion
that was banned. 


03:52.248 --> 03:55.183
We were in custody for 18 days. 


03:55.183 --> 03:57.220
Nobody knew we were under arrest


03:57.220 --> 03:59.222
—the branch or the missionary home—


03:59.222 --> 04:00.724
because we were so deep 
in the bush. 


04:00.723 --> 04:03.158
We were 2,000 kilometers 
away from the branch. 


04:03.158 --> 04:05.160
So it was just us and Jehovah. 


04:05.160 --> 04:07.963
Well, we saw Jehovah’s hand. 


04:07.963 --> 04:09.965
He heard our prayers, 


04:09.965 --> 04:12.968
and he answered us. 


04:12.968 --> 04:15.271
For example, 
we were running out of money 


04:15.272 --> 04:18.274
and a complete stranger 


04:18.273 --> 04:21.510
offered us 200 dollars (U.S.), 


04:21.510 --> 04:24.547
and that was a lot of money 
in those days. 


04:24.547 --> 04:28.484
The man that handled 
our court case was very kind. 


04:28.483 --> 04:30.753
He made a new statement, 
and at the end, 


04:30.753 --> 04:33.355
he wrote, 
“I know of no law 


04:33.355 --> 04:37.493
that prohibits me from visiting 
my Christian brothers.” 


04:37.493 --> 04:40.296
With that he said, 
“You’re free to go.” 


04:40.297 --> 04:43.000
And what a wonderful feeling 
it is to be free.


04:44.233 --> 04:46.535
After we had experienced 
Jehovah’s help 


04:46.535 --> 04:49.772
and support, 
how could we be so ungrateful 


04:49.772 --> 04:51.907
as to want to leave 
our assignment? 


04:51.907 --> 04:53.944
That is why I said that it was 


04:53.943 --> 04:56.045
only for a moment that we wanted 


04:56.045 --> 04:58.047
to return to Europe.


04:58.047 --> 05:01.250
Another time
at a small bush assembly 


05:01.250 --> 05:03.252
there was the threat 


05:03.252 --> 05:06.055
that it would be stopped 
by the authorities. 


05:06.055 --> 05:08.490
So that the brothers 
would get spiritual food,


05:08.490 --> 05:09.925
I divided them into two groups 


05:09.925 --> 05:12.762
—one group sat outside
the assembly arena; 


05:12.762 --> 05:15.565
the other half was inside.


05:15.565 --> 05:18.768
I put on a pair of shorts, 
a vest, a hat, 


05:18.768 --> 05:22.338
and sat in a camp chair; 
and gave my talk 


05:22.338 --> 05:25.441
so that if any authorities came, 
I would say, “I’m only rehearsing.” 


05:25.442 --> 05:28.510
Anyway, 
when the first half had heard, 


05:28.510 --> 05:31.113
the others came in 
and I gave the talk again. 


05:31.113 --> 05:33.181
On the day of the assembly, 


05:33.182 --> 05:35.184
the zone commissioner came, 


05:35.183 --> 05:37.253
and he said 
we couldn’t continue until he


05:37.253 --> 05:38.688
checked something. 


05:38.688 --> 05:42.091
He sent his men around to check 
who had not paid the tax, 


05:42.092 --> 05:45.995
because lies had been said
about Jehovah’s Witnesses


05:45.995 --> 05:48.030
—that we don’t pay tax. 


05:48.030 --> 05:51.567
And he was so surprised 
when they came back and said, 


05:51.567 --> 05:54.437
“Boss, everybody’s paid.” 


05:54.437 --> 05:56.172
And so he stood up, 
and he said, 


05:56.172 --> 05:58.775
“OK, you can carry on 
with your assembly.” 


05:58.775 --> 06:01.000
We were so grateful 
to Jehovah for that.


06:04.513 --> 06:07.983
Zambia is a real preaching paradise. 


06:07.983 --> 06:10.118
People are humble. 
They’re God-fearing. 


06:10.118 --> 06:11.886
And with Jehovah’s help, 


06:11.887 --> 06:13.890
we have been able to help 


06:13.890 --> 06:17.627
more than 130 people 
to come to baptism. 


06:17.627 --> 06:20.497
So we are happy in our assignment.


06:20.497 --> 06:22.899
What began 46 years ago 


06:22.898 --> 06:25.835
with tears 
and fear of the unknown 


06:25.835 --> 06:28.303
has turned out to be 
a wonderful blessing, 


06:28.303 --> 06:30.305
full of privileges 


06:30.305 --> 06:32.308
and joy. 


06:32.308 --> 06:35.376
We’ve seen firsthand 
how Jehovah has cared for us. 


06:35.377 --> 06:38.580
In fact, 
he’s ‘opened up the floodgates 


06:38.580 --> 06:41.000
of heaven 
and poured out a blessing.’


06:42.385 --> 06:46.322
As we look back over the years, 
we’re absolutely convinced 


06:46.322 --> 06:50.025
that the blessings 
outweighed the hardships.


06:50.025 --> 06:52.195
If we had the chance, 


06:52.195 --> 07:08.462
we’d do it all over again.

00:06 How did we come to Africa?
00:09 It was because we went through Gilead.
00:12 We attended the 47th class of Gilead,
00:15 and that was in 1969.
00:17 Our first assignment
00:19 was in the Belgian Congo,  which is now
00:23 the Democratic Republic of Congo.
00:26 When we got our assignment,  we were not overjoyed.
00:31 All we’d heard  about the Congo was war,
00:35 atrocities, mercenaries.
00:38 So we weren’t excited.  In fact, Susanne cried all night.
00:43 But we had promised to serve
00:46 Jehovah with our whole soul,
00:48 and we had said, “Here we are!
00:51 Send us.”
00:52 And so we accepted the assignment.
00:57 When we first arrived  in the small mining town in Katanga,
01:00 we were arrested  as soon as we got off the plane.
01:04 Then there was nobody to meet us.
01:06 The telegram,  which had been sent three days earlier,
01:09 arrived on the same plane.
01:11 The missionaries had all returned
01:13 to their home countries
01:15 for the international conventions.
01:17 So when we eventually arrived  at the missionary home,
01:20 it was empty,  and there were
01:22 only big, dead cockroaches  and bullet holes in the walls.
01:26 So we were alone for three weeks
01:29 until the other missionaries arrived.
01:32 The next hurdle to overcome
01:34 was to get used to a complete new culture
01:38 and also to learn two languages.
01:41 Communication with our families
01:44 was also a problem
01:46 —there was no Internet,  no phones.
01:48 The only way was by letters,  and it took three weeks
01:52 or almost four weeks  for a letter to get to our families
01:55 and another four weeks  to get a reply.
01:59 For years, we traveled
02:01 in the bush doing  circuit and district work.
02:05 This meant living in the villages
02:08 in mud huts.
02:10 And so we would get  water from the river
02:13 and use candles
02:15 for our power  (our electricity there)
02:18 and charcoal  to do our cooking on.
02:22 We had toilets outside —a hole in the ground.
02:25 It was real village life.
02:31 To get there,  we had to travel on roads
02:33 that were often almost nonexistent
02:35 or very, very bad —rocky, deep sand,
02:39 muddy.
02:41 When it was muddy,  it was deep mud,
02:43 and we’d get stuck.
02:48 In fact, one trip we did,
2,000 kilometers
02:50 took us ten days.
02:52 A lot of it was sand.
02:55 And one day,  we only went 70 kilometers,
02:58 and we had to dig  the vehicle out 12 times.
03:01 But we got there  with Jehovah’s help.
03:04 And as far as we were concerned,  this was missionary life
03:06 —this was real missionary life.
03:08 This was what we’d come to do.
03:10 We felt closer to Jehovah
03:14 when we were in the bush  under those difficult circumstances
03:17 than we ever have.
03:19 It was great!
03:20 We loved it,  and it’s really a big part of our life.
03:27 Some ask us if we ever desired  to return to Europe.
03:31 Truthfully, yes.
03:33 But only very momentarily.
03:38 The work was under ban  for ten years.
03:40 To carry on a religion  that was banned was a prison sentence
03:43 of between five  and ten years in prison.
03:47 And we’d been caught
03:48 carrying on a religion that was banned.
03:52 We were in custody for 18 days.
03:55 Nobody knew we were under arrest
03:57 —the branch or the missionary home—
03:59 because we were so deep  in the bush.
04:00 We were 2,000 kilometers  away from the branch.
04:03 So it was just us and Jehovah.
04:05 Well, we saw Jehovah’s hand.
04:07 He heard our prayers,
04:09 and he answered us.
04:12 For example,  we were running out of money
04:15 and a complete stranger
04:18 offered us 200 dollars (U.S.),
04:21 and that was a lot of money  in those days.
04:24 The man that handled  our court case was very kind.
04:28 He made a new statement,  and at the end,
04:30 he wrote,  “I know of no law
04:33 that prohibits me from visiting  my Christian brothers.”
04:37 With that he said,  “You’re free to go.”
04:40 And what a wonderful feeling  it is to be free.
04:44 After we had experienced  Jehovah’s help
04:46 and support,  how could we be so ungrateful
04:49 as to want to leave  our assignment?
04:51 That is why I said that it was
04:53 only for a moment that we wanted
04:56 to return to Europe.
04:58 Another time at a small bush assembly
05:01 there was the threat
05:03 that it would be stopped  by the authorities.
05:06 So that the brothers  would get spiritual food,
05:08 I divided them into two groups
05:09 —one group sat outside the assembly arena;
05:12 the other half was inside.
05:15 I put on a pair of shorts,  a vest, a hat,
05:18 and sat in a camp chair;  and gave my talk
05:22 so that if any authorities came,  I would say, “I’m only rehearsing.”
05:25 Anyway,  when the first half had heard,
05:28 the others came in  and I gave the talk again.
05:31 On the day of the assembly,
05:33 the zone commissioner came,
05:35 and he said  we couldn’t continue until he
05:37 checked something.
05:38 He sent his men around to check  who had not paid the tax,
05:42 because lies had been said about Jehovah’s Witnesses
05:45 —that we don’t pay tax.
05:48 And he was so surprised  when they came back and said,
05:51 “Boss, everybody’s paid.”
05:54 And so he stood up,  and he said,
05:56 “OK, you can carry on  with your assembly.”
05:58 We were so grateful  to Jehovah for that.
06:04 Zambia is a real preaching paradise.
06:07 People are humble.  They’re God-fearing.
06:10 And with Jehovah’s help,
06:11 we have been able to help
06:13 more than 130 people  to come to baptism.
06:17 So we are happy in our assignment.
06:20 What began 46 years ago
06:22 with tears  and fear of the unknown
06:25 has turned out to be  a wonderful blessing,
06:28 full of privileges
06:30 and joy.
06:32 We’ve seen firsthand  how Jehovah has cared for us.
06:35 In fact,  he’s ‘opened up the floodgates
06:38 of heaven  and poured out a blessing.’
06:42 As we look back over the years,  we’re absolutely convinced
06:46 that the blessings  outweighed the hardships.
06:50 If we had the chance,
06:52 we’d do it all over again.

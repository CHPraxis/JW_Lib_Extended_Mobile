00:01 What if we face a situation  in which we have access to nothing?
00:06 We are not allowed  to have a Bible,
00:09 no literature with illustrations,
00:11 no videos,  and no audio recordings.
00:15 What do we do?
00:17 Our recollection  of what we have read in the past
00:21 can keep our spirituality intact.
00:24 One of our brothers from Russia  faced such a situation.
00:28 Notice what helped him.
00:37 The year was 1963.
00:40 I was 36 at the time.
00:45 The KGB searched my home  and found some Bible literature
00:48 and some publishers’ field service reports.
00:53 So I was sentenced  to five years of imprisonment
00:56 for being an organizer.
00:58 That was the third time  I had been imprisoned.
01:03 Some brothers and sisters  and I went to the court
01:06 to support Brother Vladimir.
01:09 When he saw us,  he clasped his hands
01:12 and declared,  “Everything is fine!”
01:18 A KGB officer told me
01:20 that the only reason  I hadn’t been imprisoned
01:23 was because I had six children.
01:25 But Vladimir was single.
01:27 I was just glad  that they had arrested me and not him,
01:30 because I didn’t have a family.
01:37 In the camp, I didn’t have a Bible  or any Bible literature at all.
01:41 All I had to keep me going  was the knowledge I already had.
01:47 We prayed for him,  and we sent greetings
01:49 and encouraging messages  to him through his relatives.
01:54 Due to the strict censorship  in the camp,
01:56 we were not allowed  to write anything spiritual in our letters
01:59 to encourage each other.
02:01 If we did,  the letters were confiscated.
02:06 But I really wanted to send Brother Mikhail  something encouraging.
02:12 I was growing flowers  with a group of inmates in the camp.
02:15 So instead of a sending him a letter,
02:17 I decided to send him  a bouquet of flowers.
02:23 Vladimir’s sister Olga came to our home,
02:27 and she brought me a beautiful bouquet  of flowers from Vladimir.
02:36 I couldn’t believe  that I had received fresh flowers
02:40 from behind a barbed-wire fence —from inside the camp.
02:45 I was so touched  by his act of kindness
02:48 that my heart moved me  to write down some verses,
02:51 a poem,  which I called “The Bouquet.”
02:57 My relatives came  and visited me in the prison
03:00 and delivered to me the poem.
03:03 I kept the poem  in a very secret place.
03:06 It could have been confiscated,
03:08 and I could have been punished  because it was about God.
03:13 After Vladimir was released from prison,
03:16 well, he told me that my poem  had really strengthened him
03:20 and that he had often taken it out
03:22 of its secret hiding place  to read it over and over again.
03:28 If it hadn’t been for the support  I received from Jehovah
03:31 and the prayers of friends,
03:33 it would have been much harder  for me to serve my time.
03:37 The poem that I had received  helped me not to feel
03:40 separated from my friends
03:42 and, most importantly,  from Jehovah.
03:48 So many years have now gone by.
03:51 But we have remained firm  through the difficult times,
03:54 and we continue serving Jehovah.
04:00 Lately, Vladimir and I have been trying  to keep in touch by phone,
04:04 but we haven’t seen each other  for seven years.
04:07 I would really love  to see Vladimir again.
04:13 He doesn’t know  that I’ve decided to go and visit him.
04:17 I hope that he likes the surprise.
04:52 “I see these flowers,  grown by hands
04:55 “Hardened from work  that prison demands.
04:58 “My friend has sent a bouquet.
05:01 “Prison three times  prevented our meeting,
05:03 “But you found a way  to convey a greeting.
05:07 “My joy now moves me to say:
05:10 “‘Greetings, my brother,  with all of my heart.
05:13 “‘You gave me strength,  although we’re apart.
05:16 “‘While you have  countless trials withstood,
05:19 “‘You’ve strengthened me  as best you could.
05:22 “‘Greetings, my friend  on that narrow road,
05:26 “‘You were always with me  through hardships untold.
05:29 “‘We worked so hard  for spiritual treasure.
05:32 “‘Blessed we were  for sticking together.
05:36 “‘Cruelly, my friend,  you were taken from me
05:39 “‘When they tried  to break our integrity.
05:42 “‘But God stood by us  and helped us to cope.
05:45 “‘Conquer the evil, we did,  for our dear Kingdom hope.
05:51 “‘How grateful we are  and always will be
05:54 “‘For spiritual vision   by which we can see
05:57 “‘The crown of life  promised to those
06:01 “‘Who stay on the loyal course  they chose.
06:05 “‘How much you’ve endured,  long-suffering friend.
06:08 “‘But Jehovah’s mercy  will never end.
06:11 “‘On a paradise earth  our hands will unite,
06:14 “‘Planting more flowers  to gladden His sight.
06:18 “‘Christ Jesus will heal us  during his reign,
06:21 “‘So no trace of sin  will ever remain.
06:25 “‘And far from the trials  that we overcame,
06:27 Forever we’ll praise  Jehovah’s great name!’”
06:37 True friends are such a blessing  from Jehovah,
06:40 and you don’t really know  who they are until disaster strikes.
06:49 During my whole life,  walking in the way of the truth,
06:53 I have often thought  about the words of Psalm 119:63,
06:58 where it says:
07:00 “I am a friend of all who fear you
07:02 and of those who keep your orders.”
07:05 Our serving side by side  in the Kingdom work
07:08 has strengthened our friendship.
07:14 It is only that sort of friendship  that will last forever!
07:24 What a beautiful friendship!
07:26 Our brotherhood truly is  a blessing from Jehovah.
07:31 Brother Mikhail Savitsky spent many years  as a circuit overseer,
07:36 helping the Kingdom work progress  in Siberia, northern Caucasus,
07:41 and the countries  of Georgia and Armenia.
07:44 In 1992, he had the privilege  of being one of those
07:48 who signed the documents that confirmed  legal recognition of our work in Russia.
07:55 However, we regret to inform you
07:57 that some time  after this segment was produced,
08:00 Brother Vladimir Varkholik  fell asleep in death.
08:04 He was 88 years old
08:06 and had served Jehovah faithfully  for over 59 years.
08:10 At the time of his death,
08:12 he had served as a pioneer  for some 26 years
08:15 and as an elder  in the congregation for 43 years.
08:20 From his interview,  you can clearly see the faith
08:24 that kept his spirituality strong  through 12 years of imprisonment.
08:29 And he is a good example for us.
08:32 Did you notice one aspect  of his circumstances while incarcerated?
08:37 He said:
08:39 “In the camp,  I didn’t have a Bible
08:43 “or any Bible literature at all.
08:45 “All I had to keep me going
08:47 was the knowledge I already had.”
08:50 That could happen to us.
08:52 When persecution starts,  we need to be prepared.
08:56 That’s one reason  why it is so important
08:59 not to neglect  our study of the Bible
09:01 while we have the opportunity.

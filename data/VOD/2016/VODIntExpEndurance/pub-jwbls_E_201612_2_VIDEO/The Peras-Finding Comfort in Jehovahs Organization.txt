00:02 When someone loses a spouse,
00:05 they are a widower.
00:09 When someone loses their parents,  they’re an orphan.
00:15 But there’s no word  for when you lose your children.
00:25 In 1948,  I was born in Brainerd, Minnesota.
00:30 We never had a Bible in our house.
00:33 I asked my dad one time about God,  and he said,
00:36 “Well, God knows everything.”  End of lesson.
00:40 My dad had hardening of the arteries.
00:43 In 1962, he died of a heart attack.
00:48 I’d just turned 13.
00:50 And my parents were  so close that my mother,
00:53 who had colon cancer,
00:54 she gave up the will to live.
00:57 So in February of the next year,  she died.
01:00 About 1972,  that’s when I met Pam.
01:05 I was born in Portland, Oregon.
01:07 I was one of those high-strung children.
01:09 I still am.
01:11 I worried about a lot of things.
01:14 I already had two children by the time I met Larry,
01:17 and I didn’t want them  to inherit a world
01:21 that was just filled  with killing each other.
01:25 I joined a lot of the movements.
01:28 I marched in the peace marches
01:31 with thousands  and thousands of people.
01:33 So I thought,  ‘Well, I’ll go door to door
01:36 for this particular candidate  because he’s antiwar.’
01:40 All these things I was doing
01:42 —to put forth all this effort  to change things—
01:46 it wasn’t working.
01:49 Pam and I had gotten married,  and Nikki was born.
01:53 We were just ecstatic —very happy.
01:55 He had this croup,
01:58 and we took him to the hospital.
02:00 And there was a doctor there,  and he diagnosed it
02:04 as ataxia-telangiectasia.
02:05 And it’s a progressive disorder.
02:09 There’s no cure for it.
02:14 Pam was pregnant the second time,
02:17 and we had Nathaniel Thomas.
02:19 And he too had this condition
02:22 of ataxia.
02:25 I cried.
02:27 I cried and cried.
02:28 I cried my eyes out during that time.
02:35 So the Witnesses found me,
02:38 and they just kept calling  and talking to me
02:40 and being so kind to me.
02:45 When we studied that  Jesus talked
02:47 about the little sparrow even is important to him,
02:51 and how much more important a human is.
02:54 So that meant a lot to me.
02:59 After Pam was baptized,
03:02 I could see changes  that this was good for the family.
03:07 Once we were in the congregation,
03:09 everybody loved them,  and all the friends were wonderful.
03:12 She told me that I could study
03:15 with any brother  in the hall that I wanted;
03:17 just go ask him.
03:18 So I did.
03:20 That helped me to be  a better father
03:23 and to be a better husband.
03:29 Nineteen eighty-six,  October of that year,
03:33 our oldest boy, Nikki,  he fell asleep in death.
03:38 He was 13 when he died.
03:43 Our youngest boy, Nate,  was 16 when he died.
03:48 Debbie, she had melanoma,
03:51 and it had gone into her brain,  and she had brain tumors.
03:55 Well, she didn’t last  but a couple months,
03:58 and she fell asleep in death.
04:02 There we were;
04:03 we had a complete empty nest.
04:09 And about that time,  Pam got diagnosed with breast cancer.
04:13 The first chemotherapy, there were two,
04:15 just about killed me.
04:17 It came really close  because it was hard
04:20 to even breathe sometimes.
04:22 Two bouts of breast cancer —she kept on pioneering.
04:27 When Larry got hurt falling through the ceiling,
04:31 the whole left side of his face  hit the corner of the metal wood stove
04:36 and broke it all the way through.
04:38 He had to be fed by a tube  through a little opening in his teeth.
04:44 Second Corinthians 1:3, 4  talks about “the God of all comfort.”
04:50 It’s easy to be comfortable  when everything is going well.
04:56 When these kinds of things happen,
04:58 to find true comfort
05:02 is within Jehovah’s organization.
05:16 You can go through something,
05:19 and you can still keep a theocratic routine.
05:25 A theocratic routine is what helps us to endure.
05:31 We knew that we would like to end  this system of things as pioneers.
05:37 Larry and I are out in service together  almost every single day.
05:41 We found that pioneering together
05:44 and having Bible studies together  is very powerful.
05:48 We helped  on a regional building project together.
05:54 It’s a wonderful spiritual time.
05:57 You don’t rely on yourself.
05:59 You have to rely on Jehovah.
06:02 When Jehovah loves you,  he takes care of you
06:06 —keeps you on your feet.
06:09 Every day I remember my children.
06:12 You don’t forget the people you love.
06:14 And if you love Jehovah,  you won’t forget him.
06:18 “God is love,”  and that love is what helps us
06:22 to be able to endure.

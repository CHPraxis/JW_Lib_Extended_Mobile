00:00.917 --> 00:03.052
We’ve now invited 


00:03.052 --> 00:06.422
Brother and Sister Ortiz 
from New Britain, Connecticut, 


00:06.422 --> 00:08.825
to visit our studio. 


00:08.825 --> 00:12.362
Brother Ortiz serves as an elder 
and as a regular pioneer. 


00:12.362 --> 00:15.699
He’s had many additional privileges 
of service over the years. 


00:15.698 --> 00:20.503
And Linnette has been regular pioneering 
for over six years. 


00:20.503 --> 00:25.375
However, the reason we wanted 
to talk with them is that thus far 


00:25.375 --> 00:29.978
they have successfully countered 
Satan’s attacks on their family. 


00:29.978 --> 00:32.581
We’d like to hear 
how they accomplished this. 


00:32.582 --> 00:34.584
First of all, Freddie, 


00:34.583 --> 00:36.986
tell us a little bit 
about your family.


00:36.987 --> 00:40.057
Neither Linnette nor I 
were raised in the truth. 


00:40.057 --> 00:42.992
However, we met, 
and we fell in love. 


00:42.992 --> 00:45.795
At that time, 
marriage was not for me. 


00:45.795 --> 00:48.865
So we started 
a romantic relationship for two years 


00:48.865 --> 00:52.535
before we started attending 
the first meeting at the Kingdom Hall. 


00:52.535 --> 00:55.072
Soon thereafter, 
we started studying the Bible; 


00:55.072 --> 00:58.609
and we took two studies per week; 
we knew this was the truth. 


00:58.608 --> 01:00.610
But also we learned 


01:00.610 --> 01:03.880
how Jehovah sees immorality, 
so we needed to do some changes. 


01:03.880 --> 01:07.683
Linnette’s parents 
wanted her to continue 


01:07.683 --> 01:12.021
with her education, 
so we needed to change our behavior. 


01:12.022 --> 01:14.757
So two years after, 


01:14.757 --> 01:17.427
we did the changes. 


01:17.427 --> 01:19.895
Number one 
because we did love Jehovah. 


01:19.895 --> 01:22.298
Number two because we loved 
what we were learning. 


01:22.298 --> 01:26.035
It was worth it 
to follow Bible principles. 


01:26.035 --> 01:28.370
So two years later, 
we got married 


01:28.370 --> 01:31.507
and we got baptized
—and we got married.


01:31.507 --> 01:32.642
Very good. 


01:32.642 --> 01:36.579
So, Linnette, you were raised 
without a knowledge of Jehovah God. 


01:36.578 --> 01:39.715
What changes did you both 
have to make to ensure 


01:39.715 --> 01:42.785
your own family 
would have a fine foundation 


01:42.785 --> 01:44.787
and be successful?


01:44.787 --> 01:49.259
Well, prior to our baptism, 
Freddie had a serious drinking problem. 


01:49.258 --> 01:52.961
And based on the way we were raised, 
there was a lot of jealousy going on


01:52.962 --> 01:57.000
and, I would say, a lack of confidence 
and trust in each other. 


01:58.702 --> 02:01.570
My Bible teacher, 
thankfully, suggested to us 


02:01.570 --> 02:05.107
to study the book 
Making Your Family Life Happy. 


02:05.107 --> 02:08.645
And we ended up studying 
that book twice. 


02:08.645 --> 02:12.782
That publication and the Bible principles 
in it became the foundation 


02:12.782 --> 02:17.187
of our wonderful marriage 
and the happy family we enjoy today.


02:17.187 --> 02:18.187
Very nice. 


02:18.187 --> 02:22.059
So, Freddie, maybe you 
can tell us about your children 


02:22.058 --> 02:24.060
and what they are doing 
with their lives now.


02:24.060 --> 02:25.528
We have two sons. 


02:25.528 --> 02:27.530
Gabriel, he’s the oldest one. 


02:27.530 --> 02:30.533
He started regular pioneering 
when he was 14 years old. 


02:30.533 --> 02:34.536
At 18, he was appointed 
as a ministerial servant. 


02:34.537 --> 02:38.407
At 22 years old, he has been working 
in the Plumbing Department 


02:38.407 --> 02:40.610
at the Warwick construction 
for more than two years. 


02:40.610 --> 02:43.813
Adrian is now 18 years old. 


02:43.813 --> 02:47.550
And he also started 
regular pioneering when he was 14. 


02:47.550 --> 02:50.187
Currently, he handles 
the accounts for the congregation 


02:50.187 --> 02:52.855
and other privileges as well.


02:52.855 --> 02:57.460
Well, they both have had 
an early start in their theocratic careers. 


02:57.460 --> 02:59.128
That’s commendable. 


02:59.128 --> 03:01.130
I’m sure you’re both 
proud of them. 


03:01.130 --> 03:03.533
And we’re confident 
that Jehovah, 


03:03.533 --> 03:06.335
the One “to whom 
every family . . . owes its name,” 


03:06.335 --> 03:10.273
is pleased that they are giving 
an answer to his taunter. 


03:10.273 --> 03:13.141
In addition 
to the Family Life book, 


03:13.142 --> 03:16.579
what else contributed 
to the success your family 


03:16.578 --> 03:18.581
has experienced, Linnette?


03:18.582 --> 03:22.385
The Governing Body has provided us 
with so many publications 


03:22.385 --> 03:26.990
with direction for families, 
of course, all based on Jehovah’s Word. 


03:26.990 --> 03:31.860
So we decided early on that whenever 
a question or an issue came up, 


03:31.860 --> 03:35.130
we would not make 
any decision based on impulse. 


03:35.130 --> 03:38.467
Instead, we would research it 
in the publications. 


03:38.467 --> 03:42.205
We pray to Jehovah 
for him to give us wisdom. 


03:42.205 --> 03:45.408
And we even pray 
for him to guide us 


03:45.408 --> 03:50.446
to find the right time to talk 
to each other or to counsel the boys. 


03:50.447 --> 03:53.315
I have always heard 
that there are stages 


03:53.315 --> 03:56.318
in the child’s life 
and personality development. 


03:56.318 --> 04:00.055
So I researched in advance 
as to what to expect. 


04:00.055 --> 04:02.792
In that way, 
we were not surprised 


04:02.792 --> 04:07.597
when we saw changes 
in attitudes or ideas. 


04:07.597 --> 04:11.034
And that helped us 
realize what needed 


04:11.033 --> 04:15.271
to be addressed or corrected 
as opposed to what was normal 


04:15.272 --> 04:18.274
for that stage 
in the boys’ lives.


04:18.273 --> 04:19.541
Very practical. 


04:19.542 --> 04:21.710
Freddie, 
what can you add?


04:21.710 --> 04:26.082
Over the years, I have learned 
how essential it is to become a good listener


04:26.082 --> 04:27.817
—also understanding. 


04:27.817 --> 04:29.885
I tell my family 
how much I love them every day 


04:29.885 --> 04:32.522
because we never know 
when circumstances might change. 


04:32.522 --> 04:36.059
Family worship 
is very important for us. 


04:36.058 --> 04:39.861
I know it is easy to put off, 
but the benefits are hard to beat. 


04:39.862 --> 04:43.065
Well, 
before this arrangement started, 


04:43.065 --> 04:48.137
we as a family, we valued 
the Bible study with the family. 


04:48.137 --> 04:53.209
I learned that a fetus 
that is six months, 


04:53.208 --> 04:55.811
he can recognize 
the family’s voice. 


04:55.812 --> 04:59.949
So I started a Bible study with my sons 
when they were still in the womb . . .


04:59.948 --> 05:01.216
Isn’t that nice.


05:01.217 --> 05:04.554
. . . and continued 
to do so after that. 


05:04.553 --> 05:08.490
I know that secular work 
and other activities 


05:08.490 --> 05:12.562
can block 
a regular program, 


05:12.562 --> 05:16.099
but we need to fight that tendency 
if we want to succeed in family worship.


05:16.098 --> 05:18.100
Very good. 


05:18.100 --> 05:20.437
Well, it seems your efforts 
paid off when we consider 


05:20.437 --> 05:23.840
how well your family 
has done spiritually 


05:23.840 --> 05:27.743
and the close relationship 
you have with each other. 


05:27.743 --> 05:31.446
Now Linnette, 
it sounds as if the family is perfect


05:31.447 --> 05:33.884
—no challenges. 


05:33.883 --> 05:35.885
Is that the case?


05:35.885 --> 05:37.887
No, not at all. 


05:37.887 --> 05:41.490
First Corinthians 10:13 says 
that Christians will face 


05:41.490 --> 05:43.625
challenges 
that are “common to [all] men.” 


05:43.625 --> 05:48.563
And we have faced the normal challenges 
that come with raising a family. 


05:48.563 --> 05:51.866
The same verse indicates 


05:51.867 --> 05:56.005
that if we do things 
Jehovah’s way, 


05:56.005 --> 06:00.877
we may increase the opportunity 
for him to “make the way out” for us. 


06:00.877 --> 06:02.879
One unexpected challenge 


06:02.878 --> 06:06.181
that has changed 
our family dynamics 


06:06.182 --> 06:08.785
over the years now, 
was when Freddie 


06:08.785 --> 06:11.987
was diagnosed 
with cancer in 2012. 


06:11.987 --> 06:16.659
The treatment was aggressive 
and took its toll on his health. 


06:16.658 --> 06:19.661
Our whole lifestyle changed. 


06:19.662 --> 06:22.065
We had to move out 
from our house . . .


06:22.065 --> 06:23.198
Oh, boy.


06:23.198 --> 06:25.233
. . . to an apartment, 


06:25.233 --> 06:27.403
we gave away our dog, Spike, 


06:27.403 --> 06:33.000
and we have to watch our expenses 
really closely to keep going. 


06:34.843 --> 06:38.680
This could have put a lot 
of strain in our family, 


06:38.680 --> 06:41.750
in our marriage, 
and in our spirituality. 


06:41.750 --> 06:46.488
But, again, by praying to Jehovah constantly
and applying Bible principles, 


06:46.488 --> 06:49.825
I can say my marriage 


06:49.825 --> 06:51.827
and my family 
have never been better.


06:51.827 --> 06:52.962
Wow.


06:52.962 --> 06:57.134
Spiritually, we kept our routine, 
and we all stayed 


06:57.133 --> 06:59.935
in full-time service 
throughout the ordeal. 


06:59.935 --> 07:03.205
The boys 
have cooperated very well. 


07:03.205 --> 07:06.208
They have offered 
to work to give us money. 


07:06.208 --> 07:10.011
But we prefer for them 
to keep focused on the Kingdom 


07:10.012 --> 07:13.349
because we are confident 
that Jehovah 


07:13.348 --> 07:16.418
will add on 
to the things we need. 


07:16.418 --> 07:19.488
Freddie has been 
a great example for all of us 


07:19.488 --> 07:21.556
because he pushes himself 


07:21.557 --> 07:24.627
to keep his spiritual routine. 


07:24.627 --> 07:27.964
You never see him 
complaining or in a bad mood. 


07:27.963 --> 07:31.433
And that has been very inspiring 
for the rest of the family.


07:31.433 --> 07:33.000
Boy, that is quite a story. 


07:34.837 --> 07:38.809
You folks will certainly relate 
to the convention drama video 


07:38.808 --> 07:41.476
that was advertised 
on our April program. 


07:41.477 --> 07:45.949
Freddie, we’re very sorry to hear 
about your physical condition. 


07:45.948 --> 07:49.818
Are there any 
favorite scriptures that you use 


07:49.818 --> 07:52.888
to help keep you going spiritually 
and to stay strong?


07:52.888 --> 07:55.423
There are many of them. 


07:55.423 --> 08:00.128
Just to mention a few, 
Philippians 4:6,7 


08:00.128 --> 08:04.000
has been my life since 2012, 


08:04.000 --> 08:06.068
where I have to pray 
to Jehovah constantly 


08:06.068 --> 08:08.270
so that he can give me 
the strength that I need 


08:08.270 --> 08:11.540
to overcome my health. 


08:11.540 --> 08:14.943
And also, 
Philippians says 


08:14.943 --> 08:18.280
that he will give us 
peace of mind. 


08:18.280 --> 08:21.583
In addition, 
he will safeguard our heart. 


08:21.583 --> 08:25.386
And that’s something 
I’ve been seeing from Jehovah. 


08:25.387 --> 08:29.925
Also, Isaiah 41:10 states: 


08:29.925 --> 08:34.130
“Do not be anxious, 
for I am your God.” 


08:34.130 --> 08:37.733
Those words give me comfort 
that he will keep on helping us 


08:37.733 --> 08:41.970
in these different circumstances 
in our life. 


08:41.970 --> 08:45.842
I do understand that my wife has a lot 
of responsibilities in the household,


08:45.842 --> 08:48.510
so I had to reread 
Proverbs 31 


08:48.510 --> 08:51.380
verses 10 to 31, 


08:51.380 --> 08:54.517
where it describes 
all of the responsibility a good wife 


08:54.517 --> 08:57.387
might have to shoulder 
for the family. 


08:57.387 --> 09:00.522
So Brother Morris, 
she is my Proverbs 31 wife!


09:00.522 --> 09:03.525
A good wife for sure. 


09:03.525 --> 09:07.397
You’ve obviously shown how much 
you love and respect each other. 


09:07.397 --> 09:09.399
That’s commendable. 


09:09.398 --> 09:12.801
And your focus on being the best parents 
you could be is a good example 


09:12.802 --> 09:16.105
for parents viewing 
the program at this time. 


09:16.105 --> 09:19.242
This will come 
as a surprise to you, 


09:19.242 --> 09:23.079
but we would like to invite your two sons 
out to see what they remember 


09:23.078 --> 09:26.181
from growing up 
in the family.


09:26.182 --> 09:30.000
We have Gabriel 
and Adrian with us. 


09:35.892 --> 09:38.360
Mom’s getting a little teary-eyed. 


09:38.360 --> 09:41.497
That’s understandable. 
It was a surprise, see. 


09:41.497 --> 09:45.869
So Gabriel, 
since you’re the oldest, 


09:45.868 --> 09:48.336
we will start with you. 


09:48.337 --> 09:50.874
What do you remember 
about your family life, 


09:50.873 --> 09:54.610
first in Puerto Rico 
and later here in the United States?


09:54.610 --> 09:59.115
I remember faithfully going 
to all the meetings and going out in service


09:59.115 --> 10:02.318
every Saturday
—that was just the routine. 


10:02.318 --> 10:05.320
In Puerto Rico, 
my dad had to work a lot though, 


10:05.320 --> 10:08.357
and like he said before, 
that’s easy to get in the way 


10:08.357 --> 10:11.960
of a good family worship routine. 


10:11.960 --> 10:16.165
But I can honestly say that once we made 
that transition of moving over here, 


10:16.165 --> 10:19.368
that helped us to have 
a good family worship routine, 


10:19.368 --> 10:22.805
and it has helped us 
to get closer and closer each day.


10:22.805 --> 10:24.107
Now, isn’t that nice?


10:24.107 --> 10:27.142
Now, Adrian, anything you can add 
about the homelife?


10:27.142 --> 10:29.445
Yeah, my mom 
and dad have always 


10:29.445 --> 10:33.315
shown a great love for Jehovah 
but also for each other. 


10:33.315 --> 10:37.052
So as kids, 
you could just sense that. 


10:37.052 --> 10:39.255
So love and respect 
is what we’ve always known. 


10:39.255 --> 10:43.858
Even now that my brother and I are older, 
we have a great bond with each other. 


10:43.858 --> 10:47.195
We love each other and we can tell 
each other everything about our lives. 


10:47.195 --> 10:50.667
And it’s due to that love 
and respect that they have shown. 


10:50.667 --> 10:52.735
And even if there are disagreements, 


10:52.735 --> 10:54.737
which there are always going 
to be disagreements 


10:54.737 --> 10:56.739
because it’s an imperfect family, 


10:56.738 --> 11:00.608
but that love is always there 
to bridge those differences. 


11:00.608 --> 11:03.745
I also would like to add, 
something that helped me a lot 


11:03.745 --> 11:06.815
was a routine 
that my dad and I had 


11:06.815 --> 11:11.020
right before going to school; 
we would always read the daily text. 


11:11.020 --> 11:15.257
And he would always say, “Behave, 
and remember that Jehovah loves you.” 


11:15.257 --> 11:19.829
I don’t think he knows 
how much that really helped me 


11:19.828 --> 11:22.030
go through 
everyday challenges at school.


11:22.030 --> 11:24.033
That’s priceless. 


11:24.033 --> 11:26.935
Now, very nice observations. 


11:26.935 --> 11:31.473
Gabriel, I’m interested 
in understanding what prompted you 


11:31.473 --> 11:35.343
to regular pioneer 
when you were only 14 years old?


11:35.343 --> 11:38.013
It was at a point 
where my dad lost his job. 


11:38.013 --> 11:40.515
Rather than stressing about it
—worrying about it


11:40.515 --> 11:44.187
—he looked at things 
with a spiritual perspective. 


11:44.187 --> 11:46.189
So he started to pioneer. 


11:46.188 --> 11:49.258
And since our schedules 
matched perfectly, 


11:49.258 --> 11:51.260
I was his little pioneer buddy. 


11:51.260 --> 11:53.995
I would go out in service 
with him whenever he needed it. 


11:53.995 --> 11:57.867
And I feel like if spiritual families, 
you know, focus on spiritual matters, 


11:57.867 --> 12:01.004
it helps them 
to become closer. 


12:01.003 --> 12:03.871
And I can’t imagine 
how our relationship 


12:03.872 --> 12:06.875
and respect for one another 
can be any better than what it is now.


12:06.875 --> 12:08.743
Very nice. 


12:08.743 --> 12:11.513
Now, Adrian, 
you began pioneering 


12:11.513 --> 12:13.515
when you were 14 as well. 


12:13.515 --> 12:16.452
How do you think 
that affected you as a person?


12:16.452 --> 12:19.455
Well, first of all, 
the reason why I started pioneering 


12:19.455 --> 12:22.658
was because I was going out in service 
with the rest of my family, 


12:22.658 --> 12:26.428
and since they were already pioneering, 
I was getting the time in. 


12:26.428 --> 12:29.731
But I do think 
that taking on the responsibility 


12:29.732 --> 12:32.067
of getting 
at least 70 hours a month 


12:32.067 --> 12:36.605
in the service 
does make you think differently 


12:36.605 --> 12:38.673
at 14 than it would have otherwise. 


12:38.673 --> 12:41.876
I think it has helped me 
mature spiritually, 


12:41.877 --> 12:45.647
and it has contributed to me being used 
to my full potential in the congregation. 


12:45.647 --> 12:50.652
And honestly, I wouldn’t trade it 
for anything, well, maybe going to Bethel.


12:50.652 --> 12:54.055
Gabriel, back to you. 


12:54.055 --> 12:56.458
Tell us what was it like 
when you learned 


12:56.458 --> 12:59.195
that your dad 
had a serious health problem 


12:59.195 --> 13:03.332
and would not be able to provide 
for the family like he used to?


13:03.332 --> 13:07.135
That was probably one 
of the biggest challenges I have ever faced.


13:07.135 --> 13:11.073
When my dad got diagnosed with cancer, 
it was about the same time 


13:11.073 --> 13:14.143
that I got my call to Bethel. 


13:14.143 --> 13:16.678
And I was torn; I was divided. 


13:16.678 --> 13:19.281
I felt like if I was to go 
to Bethel now, 


13:19.282 --> 13:23.485
it would be selfish of me 
to leave my family at a time like that. 


13:23.485 --> 13:26.355
But my family 
always had a spiritual view 


13:26.355 --> 13:31.060
on things and cited scriptures 
like Matthew 6:33 constantly. 


13:31.060 --> 13:35.130
It helped me to see as a whole—as a family
—we put Kingdom interests first; 


13:35.130 --> 13:37.132
that Jehovah 
was going to provide 


13:37.132 --> 13:39.735
because he’s a loving father 
and friend. 


13:39.735 --> 13:44.072
And then my dad lost his job, 
and again all these feelings came up. 


13:44.072 --> 13:47.275
But my family was adamant. 


13:47.275 --> 13:51.180
They let me know that the congregation 
had been taking care of them 


13:51.180 --> 13:54.417
for months now, 
and then doing some simplifying 


13:54.417 --> 13:56.552
on their own 
helped them as well. 


13:56.552 --> 13:58.620
And I didn’t have to worry 
about anything. 


13:58.620 --> 14:02.692
I do know that there’s a scripture that says
that we’ve got to take care of our own. 


14:02.692 --> 14:06.629
So I do anything I can 
to help my family back home. 


14:06.628 --> 14:11.500
The only thing I hope 
is that I can have a good faith 


14:11.500 --> 14:15.872
like they’ve shown 
through these difficult times.


14:15.872 --> 14:19.342
Well, thank all of you 
for joining us. 


14:19.342 --> 14:22.210
I think all of us 
are feeling that emotion 


14:22.210 --> 14:24.747
and feel very close 
to you for sharing that. 


14:24.747 --> 14:28.817
Now, as a father, I can appreciate 
all that Freddie is trying to do 


14:28.817 --> 14:31.354
as head of the family. 


14:31.353 --> 14:34.256
And, Linnette, your support 
beyond normal 


14:34.257 --> 14:36.859
is very much 
to be commended. 


14:36.858 --> 14:40.128
We can tell your family 
is thriving spiritually, 


14:40.128 --> 14:43.598
and we pray Jehovah 
will continue to bless your efforts, 


14:43.598 --> 14:45.600
come what may. 


14:45.600 --> 14:47.870
And we thank you, 
Gabriel and Adrian, 


14:47.870 --> 14:51.740
for your surprise 
to the studio. 


14:51.740 --> 14:55.410
Thank you very much 
for taking the time to be interviewed.


14:55.410 --> 14:56.112
Thank you for the privilege.


14:56.112 --> 14:56.745
Thank you for the privilege.


14:56.745 --> 15:08.140
Thank you.

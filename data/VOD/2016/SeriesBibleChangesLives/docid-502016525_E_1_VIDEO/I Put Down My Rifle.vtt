00:04.317 --> 00:07.654
I was in the military 
for 13 years.


00:07.653 --> 00:12.365
Women didn’t used to belong 
to combat regiments.


00:12.365 --> 00:17.000
I was the first to obtain 
the rank of sergeant in my regiment.


00:18.788 --> 00:21.875
I lived the army 24/7. 


00:21.875 --> 00:23.877
The clothes I wore, 


00:23.877 --> 00:26.714
the people I associated with


00:26.713 --> 00:30.000
—everything was military.


00:32.182 --> 00:36.224
Being in a man’s field 
is very intimidating. 


00:36.223 --> 00:41.186
I felt I had to work twice as hard, 
be twice as fast, and be twice as good. 


00:41.187 --> 00:45.399
So I became more and more aggressive 


00:45.398 --> 00:49.110
in order to accomplish the missions 
that were given to me. 


00:49.110 --> 00:52.698
I let the pressure to perform 


00:52.698 --> 00:55.000
affect me in negative ways.


00:56.452 --> 00:59.000
I did not feel anything. 


01:00.957 --> 01:02.999
I used more profanity. 


01:02.998 --> 01:05.751
I drank more heavily. 


01:05.752 --> 01:08.000
I smoked more.


01:10.757 --> 01:13.000
It wasn’t the quality 
of the life that I wanted.


01:16.055 --> 01:19.000
I felt that my life 
wasn’t going anywhere.


01:24.730 --> 01:27.148
And there was a knock 
on the front door.


01:27.148 --> 01:30.901
It was very surprising 
to learn from the Scriptures 


01:30.902 --> 01:33.489
that I could draw close to God.


01:33.488 --> 01:37.408
But the Witnesses, 
they explained things in a way 


01:37.408 --> 01:39.578
that it made sense, 


01:39.578 --> 01:43.415
and I could verify all of it myself.


01:43.415 --> 01:47.377
I didn’t understand what they meant 


01:47.377 --> 01:49.714
by ‘God could love you.’ 


01:49.713 --> 01:52.883
The Witnesses showed me 
how to look in the Bible 


01:52.883 --> 01:56.345
and find out what the Bible 
said about it all. 


01:56.345 --> 02:01.017
It gave me a desire 
to keep going, 


02:01.017 --> 02:04.000
and things started 
to get a lot better.


02:05.478 --> 02:07.648
When I put down my rifle 


02:07.648 --> 02:11.985
and I picked up a Bible, 
those around me, 


02:11.985 --> 02:15.113
they didn’t understand it at all.


02:15.113 --> 02:19.993
It’s worth everything just to show someone 
that they can be loved. 


02:19.993 --> 02:23.705
Just to watch that change is fabulous.


02:23.705 --> 02:28.710
It’s only with a lot of prayer and meditation 


02:28.710 --> 02:32.630
that I was able to change my personality. 


02:32.630 --> 02:34.633
Jehovah guides me. 


02:34.633 --> 02:38.803
If you put your anxiety on him, 


02:38.803 --> 02:42.000
he will give you that peace.


02:43.558 --> 02:46.645
My husband is my joy. 


02:46.645 --> 02:48.897
He’s showing me the patience 


02:48.897 --> 02:51.317
and the loving-kindness 


02:51.317 --> 02:53.319
that Jehovah wants families 


02:53.318 --> 02:56.405
to experience.


02:56.405 --> 03:01.410
The members of my congregation 
are my family. 


03:01.410 --> 03:04.245
They are my brothers and sisters. 


03:04.245 --> 03:07.917
I now have a huge worldwide family.


03:07.917 --> 03:11.874
We have a lovely, lovely congregation. 


03:11.873 --> 03:15.043
And to be able to laugh and joke 


03:15.043 --> 03:19.845
and to talk about Jehovah, it’s wonderful.


03:19.845 --> 03:22.347
When I was in the military, 


03:22.347 --> 03:26.352
I became a very dark and uncaring person.


03:26.352 --> 03:30.272
Jehovah has taught me how to beat my sword 


03:30.272 --> 03:32.274
into a plowshare. 


03:32.273 --> 03:35.360
He taught me that I didn’t need 


03:35.360 --> 03:48.645
to “learn war anymore.”

00:00.483 --> 00:03.420
Our text today is very encouraging 
as it reminds us, 


00:03.420 --> 00:05.755
through this example of Amos, 


00:05.755 --> 00:08.392
that Jehovah notices the potential 


00:08.392 --> 00:10.394
of each one of his servants. 


00:10.393 --> 00:13.295
In fact, one of the comments 
from today’s text states: 


00:13.295 --> 00:16.232
“Even though we may
 lack self-confidence, 


00:16.232 --> 00:19.969
“Jehovah can help us 
go beyond our perceived limits 


00:19.968 --> 00:23.338
and reach goals that we 
would not have imagined.” 


00:23.338 --> 00:26.341
See, Jehovah knows our potential. 


00:26.342 --> 00:28.512
But you note from that statement, 


00:28.512 --> 00:32.249
this is also a reminder 
that we have to put forth effort 


00:32.248 --> 00:34.250
to reach our potential. 


00:34.250 --> 00:38.320
You see, if we’re not careful, 
we can sabotage our own efforts 


00:38.320 --> 00:41.457
to reach the potential 
that Jehovah sees in us. 


00:41.457 --> 00:45.262
How’s that possible? 
Well, let’s look at three examples.


00:45.262 --> 00:47.897
Number one: 
We can limit potential 


00:47.897 --> 00:52.135
by not throwing ourselves 
into what we are asked to do. 


00:52.135 --> 00:54.470
Now, we may remember 
the account of Jehoash 


00:54.470 --> 00:58.107
the king of Israel 
there in 2 Kings chapter 13, 


00:58.107 --> 01:01.510
when he visited 
the prophet Elisha who was dying. 


01:01.510 --> 01:06.248
And you notice there 
at 2 Kings 13:17 


01:06.248 --> 01:09.918
that Elisha 
notes Jehoash’s potential. 


01:09.918 --> 01:12.188
You notice he says there 
that: “You will 


01:12.188 --> 01:16.125
strike down Syria . . . 
until you finish it off.” 


01:16.125 --> 01:18.127
See, he noted the potential 


01:18.127 --> 01:20.330
that he had to finish off Syria. 


01:20.330 --> 01:22.332
But then what happens? 


01:22.332 --> 01:26.469
Well, you remember that’s where 
Elisha tells the king 


01:26.468 --> 01:29.538
to beat the arrows 
on the ground three times or—  


01:29.538 --> 01:31.740
beat it on the ground, 
and he only does it three times. 


01:31.740 --> 01:34.477
Notice what happens in verse 19: 


01:34.477 --> 01:36.479
“At that the man of the true God 


01:36.478 --> 01:38.681
“grew indignant at him and said: 


01:38.682 --> 01:42.185
“‘You should have struck the ground 
five or six times! 


01:42.185 --> 01:44.720
“‘Then you 
would have struck down Syria 


01:44.720 --> 01:46.722
“‘until you finished it off, 


01:46.722 --> 01:48.792
“‘but now 
you will strike down Syria 


01:48.792 --> 01:50.794
only three times.’” 


01:50.793 --> 01:52.528
What happened? 


01:52.528 --> 01:55.798
Well, you see, by not throwing himself 
into what he was asked to do


01:55.798 --> 01:57.800
—showing zeal for his assignment—


01:57.800 --> 02:00.068
he would only 
have limited success. 


02:00.068 --> 02:03.940
Jehoash limited his own potential.


02:03.940 --> 02:06.208
Number two: 
We can limit our potential 


02:06.208 --> 02:10.813
by focusing on our inadequacies 
or our insecurities. 


02:10.813 --> 02:14.283
The account that drives that home 
for me is that of Moses. 


02:14.283 --> 02:16.820
If you look in Exodus chapter 3, 


02:16.820 --> 02:20.690
and in this account we know 
it’s not due to lack of zeal, 


02:20.690 --> 02:23.225
but, rather, 
Moses’ own insecurities 


02:23.225 --> 02:27.063
that nearly caused him to limit 
how he was used by Jehovah. 


02:27.063 --> 02:29.065
So we know in Exodus chapter 3, 


02:29.065 --> 02:32.202
he received a very weighty assignment
—going to Pharaoh. 


02:32.202 --> 02:35.070
And notice what happens 
in verse 11, 


02:35.070 --> 02:37.407
Exodus 3:11. 


02:37.407 --> 02:40.210
It says: “However, 
Moses said to the true God: 


02:40.210 --> 02:42.545
“‘Who am I that I 
should go to Pharaoh 


02:42.545 --> 02:45.080
and bring the Israelites 
out of Egypt?’” 


02:45.080 --> 02:46.415
Now, that’s a normal reaction.


02:46.415 --> 02:47.750
We probably would have felt 
the same way. 


02:47.750 --> 02:50.353
‘Jehovah, are you sure 
you have the right person here?’ 


02:50.353 --> 02:52.355
And Jehovah says, ‘No. 
I do. 


02:52.355 --> 02:54.357
I will be with you.’ 


02:54.357 --> 02:56.825
You look on in verse 13, it says: 


02:56.825 --> 02:58.895
“But Moses said to the true God: 
‘Suppose I 


02:58.895 --> 03:00.963
“‘go to [Israel] and say to them, 


03:00.963 --> 03:03.298
“‘“The God of your forefathers 
has sent me to you,” 


03:03.298 --> 03:05.301
“‘and they say to me, 
“What is his name?” 


03:05.302 --> 03:07.204
What should I say to them?’” 


03:07.203 --> 03:09.205
Jehovah says, ‘No problem,’ 
and He explains His name


03:09.205 --> 03:11.340
—even tells him 
what His name means


03:11.340 --> 03:14.510
and how that power 
will be behind him. 


03:14.510 --> 03:17.180
Chapter 4, verse 1: 


03:17.180 --> 03:20.450
“However, Moses answered: 
‘But suppose they do not believe me 


03:20.450 --> 03:22.852
“‘and do not listen to my voice, 
for they will say,


03:22.852 --> 03:24.854
“Jehovah did not appear to you.”’” 


03:24.853 --> 03:26.890
‘No problem, Moses. 
What’s in your hand?’ 


03:26.890 --> 03:27.990
It’s where he has the staff. 


03:27.990 --> 03:30.125
He shows him miracles 
that he can perform to show 


03:30.125 --> 03:32.128
that Jehovah is behind him. 


03:32.128 --> 03:34.130
Look at verse 10: 


03:34.130 --> 03:36.900
“Moses now said to Jehovah: 
‘Pardon me, Jehovah, 


03:36.900 --> 03:39.635
“‘but I have never been a fluent speaker, 
neither in the past 


03:39.635 --> 03:41.637
“‘nor since you have spoken 
to your servant, 


03:41.637 --> 03:44.840
for I am slow of speech 
and slow of tongue.’” 


03:44.840 --> 03:47.577
‘OK, Moses, 
who created the mouth? 


03:47.577 --> 03:50.314
I’ll speak for you. 
Don’t worry about it.’ 


03:50.313 --> 03:52.315
Look at verse 13: 


03:52.315 --> 03:54.617
“But he said: ‘Pardon me, 
Jehovah, please send 


03:54.617 --> 03:56.685
anyone whom you 
want to send.’” 


03:56.685 --> 03:59.155
And notice what it says 
in verse 14: 


03:59.155 --> 04:03.425
“Then Jehovah’s anger 
blazed against Moses.” 


04:03.425 --> 04:06.028
‘Fine, you know, I’m going 
to just send somebody else.’ 


04:06.028 --> 04:08.631
But, you see, thankfully, 
Moses got the point 


04:08.632 --> 04:11.700
and he jumped into the assignment 
and was used further by Jehovah. 


04:11.700 --> 04:13.368
But what happened here? 


04:13.368 --> 04:17.140
You notice, Moses got caught up 
worrying about his inadequacies, 


04:17.140 --> 04:19.675
worrying about all the things 
that could go wrong. 


04:19.675 --> 04:21.743
Jehovah was saying, 
‘Just get moving, 


04:21.743 --> 04:23.946
and I will take care 
of the rest.’ 


04:23.947 --> 04:26.249
Jehovah saw that
Moses had the potential 


04:26.248 --> 04:28.050
to carry out this assignment; 


04:28.050 --> 04:31.687
however, 
Moses was limiting himself.


04:31.687 --> 04:34.357
Number three: 
We can limit our own potential 


04:34.357 --> 04:38.494
by becoming paralyzed by fear
—fear of failure. 


04:38.493 --> 04:41.430
If you turn to the account 
in Numbers chapter 13, 


04:41.430 --> 04:44.700
we notice that this 
is what happened to the ten spies. 


04:44.700 --> 04:46.702
And it’s very interesting, 


04:46.702 --> 04:49.705
a phrase they used when they 
came back from spying out the land. 


04:49.705 --> 04:53.000
Numbers chapter 13, 
and look at verse 33. 


04:55.243 --> 04:58.380
It says: 
“And there we saw the Nephilim, 


04:58.380 --> 05:01.217
“the sons of Anak, 
who [were] from the Nephilim, 


05:01.217 --> 05:05.020
and in comparison 
we seemed like grasshoppers,” 


05:05.020 --> 05:09.525
and notice, “both to us 
and to them.” 


05:09.525 --> 05:12.695
You see, they ran into these 
sons of Anak who were giants,


05:12.695 --> 05:14.897
men of extraordinary size 
who inhabited


05:14.897 --> 05:16.232
the mountainous region of Canaan,


05:16.232 --> 05:19.069
and it was understandable 
that these enemies of Jehovah 


05:19.068 --> 05:21.703
viewed the Israelites 
as puny grasshoppers. 


05:21.703 --> 05:24.906
‘You can just squash them
—no competition.’ 


05:24.907 --> 05:27.577
But, you know, the ten spies 


05:27.577 --> 05:30.514
saw themselves the same way. 


05:30.513 --> 05:33.115
And, see, their view 
of themselves in this situation 


05:33.115 --> 05:35.452
paralyzed them with fear 
and caused them 


05:35.452 --> 05:37.787
to demoralize the entire nation.


05:37.787 --> 05:40.322
But now, in contrast, 
we think of the account of David, 


05:40.322 --> 05:44.127
who as a young man 
also encountered a giant, Goliath. 


05:44.127 --> 05:48.064
And remember, Goliath also saw David 
as a defenseless little boy 


05:48.063 --> 05:51.133
and as a grasshopper, 
if you will. 


05:51.133 --> 05:53.668
But did David see himself 
the same way? 


05:53.668 --> 05:56.505
No, he said: ‘You are coming to me 
with sword and spear. 


05:56.505 --> 05:59.475
I am coming to you 
with the name of Jehovah.’ 


05:59.475 --> 06:03.212
You see, David did not allow himself 
to be paralyzed by fear. 


06:03.212 --> 06:07.284
He trusted in Jehovah, 
and David lived up to the potential 


06:07.283 --> 06:09.618
that Jehovah saw in him.


06:09.618 --> 06:11.620
So, what’s the lesson for us? 


06:11.620 --> 06:13.622
Well, the lesson is that this illustrates


06:13.622 --> 06:16.159
—these accounts illustrate—
that sometimes we can be 


06:16.158 --> 06:18.293
our own worst enemy at times. 


06:18.293 --> 06:20.963
See, lack of zeal
—not throwing ourself into the work, 


06:20.963 --> 06:22.965
as in the case of Jehoash; 


06:22.965 --> 06:26.802
or our own insecurities, 
as in the case of Moses; 


06:26.802 --> 06:30.272
or fear of failure, 
as in the case of the ten spies


06:30.272 --> 06:35.010
—can cause us to limit
the potential that Jehovah sees in us.


06:35.010 --> 06:37.180
So, what do we do? 


06:37.180 --> 06:40.917
Well, Jehovah’s words to Gideon 
remind us of what we could do, 


06:40.917 --> 06:44.387
and we invite you 
to turn to Judges chapter 6. 


06:44.387 --> 06:47.257
And you remember 
that for seven years 


06:47.257 --> 06:50.994
the Midianites 
oppressed the nation of Israel, 


06:50.993 --> 06:54.263
and Jehovah’s angel appears
to Gideon and says that He is going 


06:54.263 --> 06:56.831
to deliver Israel
out of this wicked nation. 


06:56.832 --> 06:58.869
How could he possibly succeed? 


06:58.868 --> 07:00.870
We read the account, 
and Gideon saw himself 


07:00.870 --> 07:03.538
as the least significant 
one of his father’s house. 


07:03.538 --> 07:06.608
And he said his father’s house 
was the least significant family 


07:06.608 --> 07:08.610
of the tribe of Manasseh. 


07:08.610 --> 07:12.548
But yet Jehovah saw 
the potential that Gideon had. 


07:12.548 --> 07:15.283
And what did Jehovah 
tell him to do? 


07:15.283 --> 07:19.000
Look at Judges 6:14. 


07:20.690 --> 07:23.492
It says: 
“Jehovah faced him and said: 


07:23.492 --> 07:26.762
“‘Go with the strength you have, 


07:26.762 --> 07:30.065
“‘and you will save Israel 
out of Midian’s hand. 


07:30.065 --> 07:32.735
Is it not I who [sent] you?’” 


07:32.735 --> 07:34.737
Interesting. 


07:34.737 --> 07:37.874
‘Go with the strength 
you have. 


07:37.873 --> 07:40.108
‘I know you cannot do it 
on your own strength. 


07:40.108 --> 07:43.980
‘Just get moving; 
throw everything you can into it; 


07:43.980 --> 07:47.450
and I, Jehovah, 
will make up the difference.’ 


07:47.450 --> 07:49.452
You see, 
that’s what Jehovah is saying, 


07:49.452 --> 07:51.987
and that’s exactly what happened.


07:51.987 --> 07:55.057
So may we be determined 
to do the same. 


07:55.057 --> 07:57.527
We know that none of us 
accomplish Jehovah’s work 


07:57.527 --> 07:59.929
on our own strength, 
on our own wisdom,


07:59.928 --> 08:01.196
on our own abilities. 


08:01.197 --> 08:03.199
But when we receive an assignment, 


08:03.198 --> 08:05.601
we need to just start moving. 


08:05.602 --> 08:09.139
Do not let our inadequacies 
paralyze us. 


08:09.138 --> 08:12.341
Do not let fear of failure 
paralyze us. 


08:12.342 --> 08:15.444
Throw ourselves into the work. 
Have a zeal for the work. 


08:15.443 --> 08:18.713
Go with the strength 
that you have. 


08:18.713 --> 08:22.518
Trust in Jehovah 
to make up the difference, 


08:22.518 --> 08:38.318
and you will live up to the potential 
that Jehovah sees in you.

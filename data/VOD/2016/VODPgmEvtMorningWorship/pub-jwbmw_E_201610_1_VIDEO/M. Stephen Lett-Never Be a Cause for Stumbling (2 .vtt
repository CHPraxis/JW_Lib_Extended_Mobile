00:00.550 --> 00:02.885
Now, this word picture 


00:02.885 --> 00:05.022
of someone being stumbled 


00:05.022 --> 00:07.024
is quite vivid, isn’t it? 


00:07.023 --> 00:09.091
We’ve all seen someone stumbled. 


00:09.092 --> 00:12.562
In fact, we’ve all stumbled 
ourselves at times, 


00:12.562 --> 00:16.499
and there are varying degrees 
of consequences. 


00:16.498 --> 00:19.235
For example, 
a person can stumble, 


00:19.235 --> 00:21.237
quickly recover, 


00:21.237 --> 00:24.974
and continue 
almost uneventfully down the path. 


00:24.973 --> 00:27.576
Or a person can stumble, 


00:27.577 --> 00:29.979
fall, break a bone, 


00:29.978 --> 00:32.181
eventually they recover


00:32.182 --> 00:34.850
—but only after extensive therapy. 


00:34.850 --> 00:37.453
Then again, a person can stumble, 


00:37.453 --> 00:40.990
fall, hit his head, 
never recover


00:40.990 --> 00:43.660
—becoming a casualty. 


00:43.660 --> 00:46.128
Well, the situation is similar 


00:46.128 --> 00:48.931
when one is stumbled spiritually. 


00:48.932 --> 00:51.334
He can recover quickly, 


00:51.333 --> 00:53.736
maybe recover over time, 


00:53.737 --> 00:55.872
or he may never recover


00:55.872 --> 00:58.775
—becoming a spiritual casualty. 


00:58.775 --> 01:02.712
So we cannot know 
the ultimate outcome 


01:02.712 --> 01:04.814
for someone who is stumbled. 


01:04.813 --> 01:07.450
So no wonder we’re cautioned 
to be very careful 


01:07.450 --> 01:11.320
to never be any cause 
for stumbling.


01:11.320 --> 01:13.990
Open up 
to Matthew chapter 18, 


01:13.990 --> 01:17.060
and here’s 
an especially powerful scripture 


01:17.060 --> 01:19.062
in this regard. 


01:19.062 --> 01:21.297
Matthew 18:6, Jesus says: 


01:21.297 --> 01:24.834
“But whoever stumbles 
one of these little ones 


01:24.833 --> 01:27.036
“who have faith in me, 


01:27.037 --> 01:30.440
“it would be better for him 
to have hung around his neck 


01:30.440 --> 01:33.777
“a millstone 
that is turned by a donkey 


01:33.777 --> 01:37.747
and to be sunk in the open sea.” 


01:37.747 --> 01:41.017
Well, with graphic language, 


01:41.017 --> 01:44.787
Jesus describes 
how that if we cause someone 


01:44.787 --> 01:47.124
to become a spiritual casualty, 


01:47.123 --> 01:49.391
we could actually bring 
eternal doom 


01:49.392 --> 01:51.394
upon ourselves. 


01:51.393 --> 01:53.395
But now, here’s a question, 


01:53.395 --> 01:56.933
What could we do 
to cause someone to stumble? 


01:56.933 --> 02:00.068
Well, interestingly, 
there are several similarities 


02:00.068 --> 02:02.871
between causing someone 
to stumble physically 


02:02.872 --> 02:05.742
and causing someone 
to stumble spiritually.


02:05.742 --> 02:07.877
Let us discuss three. 


02:07.877 --> 02:11.414
Now one, pushing someone 


02:11.413 --> 02:13.415
could cause them to stumble, 


02:13.415 --> 02:17.620
especially if they’re on uneven terrain, 
if you think about it. 


02:17.620 --> 02:21.825
And this is true 
physically and spiritually. 


02:21.825 --> 02:23.993
But think about Jehovah 
for a moment. 


02:23.993 --> 02:26.295
He could push any of us, 
couldn’t he? 


02:26.295 --> 02:28.565
He could force us to serve him. 


02:28.565 --> 02:32.502
He certainly has the power, 
but he never uses it that way. 


02:32.502 --> 02:35.439
Instead, he invites, he encourages; 


02:35.438 --> 02:37.506
and he explains the blessings, 


02:37.507 --> 02:40.510
the curses, 
depending upon how we decide. 


02:40.510 --> 02:41.978
But it’s up to us, isn’t it? 


02:41.978 --> 02:45.046
For example, at Isaiah 48:18, 


02:45.047 --> 02:48.117
Jehovah says: ‘If only 


02:48.117 --> 02:51.187
‘you would pay attention 
to my commandments! 


02:51.187 --> 02:55.192
‘Then your peace 
would become like a river 


02:55.192 --> 02:59.329
and your righteousness 
like the waves of the sea.’ 


02:59.328 --> 03:02.665
Beseeching, but not forcing. 


03:02.665 --> 03:04.900
Now think about it, 
if Jehovah doesn’t force, 


03:04.900 --> 03:07.170
he doesn’t want us 
to force either, does he? 


03:07.170 --> 03:09.638
For example, parents 


03:09.638 --> 03:12.475
need to be very careful 
they don’t just simply push 


03:12.475 --> 03:14.543
their children to serve Jehovah. 


03:14.543 --> 03:16.545
But rather, lovingly, 


03:16.545 --> 03:18.615
beseechingly like Jehovah, 


03:18.615 --> 03:20.683
try to reach the heart, 
and of course, 


03:20.683 --> 03:22.685
clearly show them the blessings 


03:22.685 --> 03:24.887
that will come their way 
if they do.


03:24.887 --> 03:26.555
Another example, 


03:26.555 --> 03:30.360
elders should never try 
to push Jehovah’s sheep. 


03:30.360 --> 03:33.897
I heard an experience 
about an elder, during his part, 


03:33.897 --> 03:36.699
asked the brothers 
for a show of hands 


03:36.698 --> 03:39.368
how many were going out in service 
the next morning. 


03:39.368 --> 03:41.971
Well, only a few raised their hand. 


03:41.972 --> 03:44.974
He proceeded 
to scold the congregation 


03:44.973 --> 03:47.310
that more should be going out. 


03:47.310 --> 03:49.845
Well, he then unwisely asked


03:49.845 --> 03:51.847
for another show of hands. 


03:51.847 --> 03:54.617
You guessed it
—fewer raised their hand 


03:54.617 --> 03:56.619
the second time. 


03:56.618 --> 03:58.655
Take another example, 


03:58.655 --> 04:01.190
those who conduct Bible studies 


04:01.190 --> 04:04.593
should not just try to push 
their students to do the right thing. 


04:04.593 --> 04:08.163
“You’ve got to quit smoking! 
You’ve got to get rid of those idols!” 


04:08.163 --> 04:10.700
No, not with external pressure, 


04:10.700 --> 04:13.302
but by motivating their hearts, 


04:13.302 --> 04:15.972
you motivate your students.


04:15.972 --> 04:18.207
Or take another example, 
none of us 


04:18.207 --> 04:21.677
should try to push schoolmates, 
workmates, or relatives 


04:21.677 --> 04:23.680
to accept the truth. 


04:23.680 --> 04:26.482
A pushing approach, 


04:26.482 --> 04:30.354
shoving approach
—even though motivated with sincerity—


04:30.353 --> 04:32.555
has actually resulted 
in people being stumbled 


04:32.555 --> 04:34.757
away from the truth 
for many years. 


04:34.757 --> 04:37.894
It makes me think of the story, 
or the saying, 


04:37.893 --> 04:40.563
that when a person 
first learns the truth, 


04:40.563 --> 04:43.365
you should lock them up 
for about six months 


04:43.365 --> 04:46.335
to contain, or minimize, 
the damage they do. 


04:46.335 --> 04:48.537
Well, that saying is totally erroneous. 


04:48.537 --> 04:52.000
You shouldn’t lock that brother up; 
you should follow that brother. 


04:53.542 --> 04:55.545
See, that brother has zeal, 
doesn’t he? 


04:55.545 --> 04:57.980
But it’s true, 
we probably do need to help him 


04:57.980 --> 04:59.982
to properly channel that zeal, 


04:59.982 --> 05:03.485
so that he doesn’t try 
to force his relatives 


05:03.485 --> 05:05.588
or others to accept the truth 


05:05.588 --> 05:08.323
that he is so excited about.


05:08.323 --> 05:11.060
But now, what is the second thing 


05:11.060 --> 05:14.930
we can do to cause someone 
to stumble? 


05:14.930 --> 05:18.868
Placing an obstacle in their path. 


05:18.868 --> 05:22.671
Now again, this is true 
physically or spiritually. 


05:22.672 --> 05:24.707
And if you think about it, 


05:24.707 --> 05:28.644
whether we put 
that stumbling block there intentionally 


05:28.643 --> 05:32.115
or unintentionally, 
the result is the same, isn’t it? 


05:32.115 --> 05:34.983
As mentioned 
in today’s Watchtower comments, 


05:34.983 --> 05:37.720
wholesome speech and upright conduct 


05:37.720 --> 05:39.722
can help us to avoid 


05:39.722 --> 05:42.225
ever being a cause for stumbling. 


05:42.225 --> 05:44.827
In contrast, unwholesome speech, 


05:44.827 --> 05:46.829
unclean conduct, 


05:46.828 --> 05:48.898
can easily stumble ones inside 


05:48.898 --> 05:50.966
or outside the congregation. 


05:50.967 --> 05:53.269
But now, what about in an area 


05:53.268 --> 05:56.338
where we have a Scriptural right 
to do something? 


05:56.338 --> 05:59.208
Now, surely exercising that right, 


05:59.208 --> 06:01.210
if it stumbles someone, 


06:01.210 --> 06:03.813
we can’t be held accountable 
for that, can we? 


06:03.813 --> 06:06.848
Well, open up 
to 1 Corinthians chapter 8, 


06:06.848 --> 06:10.018
and here
—very interestingly—


06:10.018 --> 06:12.488
this scripture 
answers that question. 


06:12.488 --> 06:16.091
1 Corinthians 8:9, 


06:16.092 --> 06:18.729
it says: 
“But keep watching 


06:18.728 --> 06:22.331
“that your right to choose 


06:22.332 --> 06:24.467
“does not somehow 


06:24.467 --> 06:27.570
become a stumbling block 
to those who are weak.” 


06:27.570 --> 06:29.572
Isn’t that interesting? 


06:29.572 --> 06:31.574
Even our right to choose, 


06:31.573 --> 06:33.708
if it would stumble someone, 


06:33.708 --> 06:36.911
we wouldn’t exercise that right 
according to this scripture. 


06:36.912 --> 06:40.517
The apostle Paul, 
in verse 13 of that same chapter, 


06:40.517 --> 06:43.519
he said he 
wouldn’t even eat meat ever again 


06:43.518 --> 06:45.588
if it stumbled his brother. 


06:45.588 --> 06:47.590
Well, like Paul, 
are we willing 


06:47.590 --> 06:50.192
to forgo our rights regarding, 


06:50.192 --> 06:52.395
for example, 
wearing a beard, 


06:52.395 --> 06:54.663
wearing heavy makeup, 


06:54.663 --> 06:58.600
using alcohol
—as just a few examples—


06:58.600 --> 07:00.670
if exercising that right 


07:00.670 --> 07:03.738
might even possibly stumble someone?


07:03.738 --> 07:05.741
But now, 
what’s the third way 


07:05.742 --> 07:08.277
we could cause someone to stumble? 


07:08.277 --> 07:10.880
Failing to warn him 


07:10.880 --> 07:13.415
about a potential trip hazard. 


07:13.415 --> 07:16.152
We could call this 
the sin of omission. 


07:16.152 --> 07:19.889
And again, 
it applies physically and spiritually. 


07:19.888 --> 07:22.891
As a physical example, 
let’s say we see the floor 


07:22.892 --> 07:24.927
has just been mopped, 


07:24.927 --> 07:27.730
and an unsuspecting person 


07:27.730 --> 07:30.332
is approaching that wet area. 


07:30.332 --> 07:32.335
Now will we warn them? 


07:32.335 --> 07:35.472
If we don’t warn them
—they fall, hurt themselves—


07:35.472 --> 07:38.607
would we not share 
some responsibility? 


07:38.607 --> 07:40.610
Well, similarly, 


07:40.610 --> 07:42.912
with spiritual application, 


07:42.912 --> 07:46.115
Galatians 6:1 tells us 


07:46.115 --> 07:49.252
that if someone “takes a false step” 
before he’s aware of it, 


07:49.252 --> 07:51.587
what are we supposed 
to try to do? 


07:51.587 --> 07:54.390
“Try to readjust” such a person, 


07:54.390 --> 07:56.725
but then it adds: 
“In a spirit of mildness.” 


07:56.725 --> 07:58.560
Don’t push him! 


07:58.560 --> 08:02.198
But try to gently, lovingly warn 


08:02.198 --> 08:04.400
and readjust that person.


08:04.400 --> 08:06.868
So there we have three areas 


08:06.868 --> 08:10.071
in which we must be careful 
we never contribute 


08:10.072 --> 08:12.442
toward someone being stumbled. 


08:12.442 --> 08:15.845
We don’t push others 
to serve Jehovah. 


08:15.845 --> 08:18.547
We strive to never, 


08:18.547 --> 08:20.717
even unintentionally, 


08:20.717 --> 08:23.652
put a stumbling block in their path
—for example—


08:23.652 --> 08:27.524
by insisting on exercising 
our personal rights. 


08:27.523 --> 08:31.460
And number three, 
we never fail to lovingly warn 


08:31.460 --> 08:34.330
one whom we see approaching 


08:34.330 --> 08:37.200
a potential trip hazard. 


08:37.200 --> 08:40.870
Rather than being 
any cause for stumbling, 


08:40.870 --> 08:43.472
we want to be 
a force for good, don’t we? 


08:43.472 --> 08:45.942
Helping others to stand firm 


08:45.942 --> 08:48.177
and even helping ones get up 


08:48.177 --> 09:00.774
if they have fallen.

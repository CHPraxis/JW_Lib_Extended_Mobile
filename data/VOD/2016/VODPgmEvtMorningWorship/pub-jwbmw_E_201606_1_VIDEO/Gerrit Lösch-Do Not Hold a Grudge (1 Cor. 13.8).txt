00:00 Paul advised the Ephesians
00:03 in Ephesians 4:26, 27:
00:07 “Let the sun not set  with you in a provoked state,
00:11 neither allow place  for the Devil.”
00:14 Yes, some even have changed  their congregation
00:19 that they attended  because of nursing a grudge
00:23 and being offended.
00:25 What can cause  a grudge to develop?
00:28 One may not have received  certain privileges that one counted on
00:33 or one feels hurt  because of seemingly or actually
00:37 having been reproved  unjustly or too severely.
00:41 Some harbor a grudge  because they’ve been criticized,
00:45 especially  if this happens repeatedly.
00:48 We can help others not to harbor a grudge  by not saying things that hurt
00:53 and by not trying  to pull the straw
00:55 out of the other’s eye,  so to say.
00:58 So, what if somebody  offends us?
01:01 We are all occasionally guilty  of a tactless or even unkind remark,
01:06 and so we want  to also forgive others.
01:09 Don’t we want others  to forgive us our unkind remarks?
01:14 There’s nobody  that does not sin with his tongue.
01:18 Don’t talk with others about your grudge  except with a trusted friend.
01:22 Talking with others  may cause division
01:25 in the congregation  or family.
01:28 Let’s see  what the Bible has to say
01:30 in Proverbs 17:9.
01:34 It says:  “Whoever forgives a transgression
01:39 “seeks love, but the one  who keeps harping on a matter
01:44 separates close friends.”
01:47 Holy spirit  can help us to forgive.
01:50 If you cannot forgive  and forget,
01:52 then talk it over  with the person that hurt you.
01:57 Holding a grudge  can lead to serious sin.
02:02 We have Bible examples like Cain  who held a grudge against Abel,
02:06 leading to his murdering him.
02:08 Joseph’s brothers held a grudge  against him because of his dreams
02:12 and because he was  the favorite of his father.
02:15 Some of them  even intended to kill Joseph.
02:18 In contrast, Joseph did not hold  a grudge against his brothers.
02:23 Esau nursed  a murderous grudge against Jacob
02:26 because Jacob  got the firstborn’s blessing.
02:29 Esau even considered killing him  after the death of his father.
02:34 Herodias was nursing  a grudge against John
02:38 for exposing her adultery,  and this led to his murder.
02:42 But fortunately, we have  many fine examples in the Bible.
02:46 Job prayed in behalf  of his three companions
02:49 who had caused him  so much grief.
02:51 Instead of holding a grudge,  he prayed for them.
02:55 Jonathan did not hold a grudge
02:57 when he learned that David  would inherit the kingdom,
03:00 although David was  about 30 years younger than him.
03:04 Peter did not hold a grudge  against Jesus
03:07 who called him Satan,  or Resister.
03:11 Also, after being rebuked  by Paul, even publically,
03:15 Peter continued  to express love for Paul.
03:19 Martha was not nursing  a grudge against Jesus
03:22 for his loving counsel  related to preparing a meal.
03:26 John Mark  did not hold a grudge when Paul
03:29 did not want him to go  with him on a missionary tour.
03:33 He continued his active service,  traveling with Barnabas.
03:38 What about the silent treatment,
03:42 so-called silent treatment?
03:44 A definite obstacle  to communication
03:48 is the silent treatment, true.
03:50 And sometimes the victim  uses this as a kind of punishment.
03:54 However,  The Watchtower 2006,
03:58 September 15, page 23,
04:02 paragraph 16, said:
04:06 “This is not always
04:10 “a matter  of punishing one’s partner,
04:12 as it may result from frustration  or discouragement.”
04:17 It could border  even on depression.
04:22 One may just be  at a loss of words
04:25 without holding a grudge.
04:29 Some may be very outspoken  and offend others repeatedly.
04:33 Proverbs 12:18 says: “Thoughtless speech  is like the stabs of a sword.”
04:38 Thoughtless speech  is not legitimate communication.
04:42 Communication  should be carried on in a loving way.
04:46 Even if somebody did not want  to hurt another intentionally,
04:50 thoughtless speech,  exaggerations, and so on, still hurt.
04:55 If somebody stabs you  with a literal sword unintentionally,
04:59 does it not still hurt?
05:02 Therefore,  dispense with talking intensely.
05:07 Intense expressions  really cause offense.
05:11 This makes sense, doesn’t it?
05:14 Intense talk is like a storm;
05:17 gentle talk  like a pleasant breeze.
05:20 Intense talk is like a rock concert;
05:23 gentle talk like pleasant music.
05:25 Intense talk  is like an avalanche or a blizzard;
05:29 gentle talk  is like a beautiful, quiet snowfall.
05:34 Intense talk is like pouring  a bucket of water on a newly planted flower;
05:39 gentle talk is like gentle rain.
05:42 So let’s all be gentle men  and gentle women.
05:47 How something is said  is very important.
05:50 Paul wrote, and we can read that  in Colossians 4:6,
05:55 a text that is generally well known,
4:6 says:
05:59 “Let your words always be gracious,  seasoned with salt,
06:04 so that you will know how  you should answer [to each one].”
06:09 Endeavor to be gracious
06:12 in your tone of voice  and word choice.
06:17 As a recipient of unloving words,  resist the urge
06:22 to be sarcastic  and keep your volume down.
06:26 But as The Watchtower said  some time ago:
06:29 “Even whispered words  can be argumentative
06:34 if they are irritating  or demeaning.”
06:37 Avoid hurtful accusations,
06:40 such as “You don’t care about me”
06:43 or “You never listen.”
06:48 Some are argumentative by nature  or because of the way they were brought up.
06:52 Blurting out one’s views  or feelings may be hurtful.
06:57 Yes, blurting leads  to being hurtful.
07:02 Merriam Webster defines blurting:
07:06 “To say something suddenly
07:08 and without thinking  about how people will react.”
07:12 Therefore,  switch on the mind
07:15 before you start operating  the mouth.
07:19 If hurt,  why not excuse yourself
07:22 and walk away  for a short while to cool down.
07:24 Go into another room  or go for a walk
07:27 until you have regained  your composure.
07:30 This is not the silent treatment.
07:34 This is a quote from the Awake!  of 15th of December,
07:39 page 4.
07:41 Don’t let a grudge  pull you into a sludge.
07:46 A grudge is also a robber;  it robs us of peace of mind.
07:50 It’s like rust that slowly corrodes  the body of a car.
07:54 The car’s outside  may appear beautiful,
07:58 but under the paint  there’s a problem.
08:01 Love keeps out resentment  and grudges,
08:05 as a good roof  keeps out rain.
08:08 And “love never fails.”
08:11 In fact, our love for Jehovah  is tested by our love for our brothers.
08:16 Here’s a scary quote  from the Insight book, Volume 2,
08:19 page 1149:
08:22 An individual  is condemned by God
08:26 if he bears a grudge  for real or fancied wrongs
08:30 done to himself  or to someone else.
08:33 It’s that serious.  It means to be grieving the holy spirit.
08:38 Remember,  we must forgive others.
08:43 That’s what the Bible says
08:45 in Leviticus 19:18.
08:50 It says this:
08:53 “You must not take vengeance  nor hold a grudge
08:58 against the sons  of your people.”
09:00 But it doesn’t end there.
09:02 The second part of the verse  is just as important.
09:07 It continues and says:
09:09 “You must love
09:11 “your fellow [man] as yourself.
09:14 I am Jehovah.”
09:17 So we appreciate  that “love never fails”
09:22 and will overcome  any feelings of having
09:26 or harboring a grudge  against somebody.

00:00.583 --> 00:03.820
Paul advised the Ephesians 


00:03.820 --> 00:07.223
in Ephesians 4:26, 27: 


00:07.223 --> 00:11.426
“Let the sun not set 
with you in a provoked state, 


00:11.427 --> 00:14.564
neither allow place 
for the Devil.” 


00:14.563 --> 00:19.368
Yes, some even have changed 
their congregation 


00:19.368 --> 00:23.038
that they attended 
because of nursing a grudge 


00:23.038 --> 00:25.041
and being offended.


00:25.042 --> 00:28.779
What can cause 
a grudge to develop? 


00:28.778 --> 00:33.081
One may not have received 
certain privileges that one counted on 


00:33.082 --> 00:37.354
or one feels hurt 
because of seemingly or actually 


00:37.353 --> 00:41.556
having been reproved 
unjustly or too severely. 


00:41.557 --> 00:45.095
Some harbor a grudge 
because they’ve been criticized, 


00:45.095 --> 00:48.097
especially 
if this happens repeatedly. 


00:48.097 --> 00:53.035
We can help others not to harbor a grudge 
by not saying things that hurt 


00:53.035 --> 00:55.438
and by not trying 
to pull the straw 


00:55.438 --> 00:58.641
out of the other’s eye, 
so to say.


00:58.642 --> 01:01.779
So, what if somebody 
offends us? 


01:01.778 --> 01:06.783
We are all occasionally guilty 
of a tactless or even unkind remark, 


01:06.783 --> 01:09.585
and so we want 
to also forgive others. 


01:09.585 --> 01:14.123
Don’t we want others 
to forgive us our unkind remarks? 


01:14.123 --> 01:18.326
There’s nobody 
that does not sin with his tongue. 


01:18.327 --> 01:22.532
Don’t talk with others about your grudge 
except with a trusted friend. 


01:22.532 --> 01:25.602
Talking with others 
may cause division 


01:25.602 --> 01:28.404
in the congregation 
or family.


01:28.403 --> 01:30.740
Let’s see 
what the Bible has to say 


01:30.740 --> 01:34.943
in Proverbs 17:9. 


01:34.943 --> 01:39.748
It says: 
“Whoever forgives a transgression 


01:39.748 --> 01:44.286
“seeks love, but the one 
who keeps harping on a matter 


01:44.287 --> 01:47.390
separates close friends.” 


01:47.390 --> 01:50.793
Holy spirit 
can help us to forgive. 


01:50.793 --> 01:52.928
If you cannot forgive 
and forget, 


01:52.928 --> 01:57.533
then talk it over 
with the person that hurt you. 


01:57.533 --> 02:02.271
Holding a grudge 
can lead to serious sin. 


02:02.272 --> 02:06.675
We have Bible examples like Cain 
who held a grudge against Abel, 


02:06.675 --> 02:08.812
leading to his murdering him. 


02:08.812 --> 02:12.482
Joseph’s brothers held a grudge 
against him because of his dreams 


02:12.482 --> 02:15.352
and because he was 
the favorite of his father. 


02:15.352 --> 02:18.622
Some of them 
even intended to kill Joseph. 


02:18.622 --> 02:23.494
In contrast, Joseph did not hold 
a grudge against his brothers. 


02:23.493 --> 02:26.695
Esau nursed 
a murderous grudge against Jacob 


02:26.695 --> 02:29.832
because Jacob 
got the firstborn’s blessing. 


02:29.832 --> 02:34.770
Esau even considered killing him 
after the death of his father. 


02:34.770 --> 02:38.107
Herodias was nursing 
a grudge against John 


02:38.107 --> 02:42.512
for exposing her adultery, 
and this led to his murder.


02:42.512 --> 02:46.249
But fortunately, we have 
many fine examples in the Bible. 


02:46.248 --> 02:49.251
Job prayed in behalf 
of his three companions 


02:49.252 --> 02:51.654
who had caused him 
so much grief. 


02:51.653 --> 02:55.258
Instead of holding a grudge, 
he prayed for them. 


02:55.258 --> 02:57.926
Jonathan did not hold a grudge 


02:57.927 --> 03:00.597
when he learned that David 
would inherit the kingdom, 


03:00.597 --> 03:04.867
although David was 
about 30 years younger than him. 


03:04.867 --> 03:07.937
Peter did not hold a grudge 
against Jesus 


03:07.937 --> 03:11.140
who called him Satan, 
or Resister. 


03:11.140 --> 03:15.278
Also, after being rebuked 
by Paul, even publically, 


03:15.278 --> 03:19.248
Peter continued 
to express love for Paul. 


03:19.248 --> 03:22.718
Martha was not nursing 
a grudge against Jesus 


03:22.718 --> 03:26.388
for his loving counsel 
related to preparing a meal. 


03:26.388 --> 03:29.325
John Mark 
did not hold a grudge when Paul 


03:29.325 --> 03:33.930
did not want him to go 
with him on a missionary tour. 


03:33.930 --> 03:38.802
He continued his active service, 
traveling with Barnabas.


03:38.802 --> 03:42.405
What about the silent treatment, 


03:42.405 --> 03:44.673
so-called silent treatment? 


03:44.673 --> 03:48.010
A definite obstacle 
to communication 


03:48.010 --> 03:50.078
is the silent treatment, true. 


03:50.078 --> 03:54.283
And sometimes the victim 
uses this as a kind of punishment. 


03:54.283 --> 03:58.486
However, 
The Watchtower 2006, 


03:58.487 --> 04:02.759
September 15, page 23, 


04:02.758 --> 04:06.061
paragraph 16, said: 


04:06.062 --> 04:10.199
“This is not always 


04:10.198 --> 04:12.801
“a matter 
of punishing one’s partner, 


04:12.802 --> 04:17.740
as it may result from frustration 
or discouragement.” 


04:17.740 --> 04:22.412
It could border 
even on depression. 


04:22.412 --> 04:25.615
One may just be 
at a loss of words 


04:25.615 --> 04:29.285
without holding a grudge.


04:29.285 --> 04:33.690
Some may be very outspoken 
and offend others repeatedly. 


04:33.690 --> 04:38.493
Proverbs 12:18 says: “Thoughtless speech 
is like the stabs of a sword.” 


04:38.493 --> 04:42.565
Thoughtless speech 
is not legitimate communication. 


04:42.565 --> 04:46.368
Communication 
should be carried on in a loving way. 


04:46.368 --> 04:50.973
Even if somebody did not want 
to hurt another intentionally, 


04:50.973 --> 04:55.911
thoughtless speech, 
exaggerations, and so on, still hurt. 


04:55.912 --> 04:59.915
If somebody stabs you 
with a literal sword unintentionally, 


04:59.915 --> 05:02.585
does it not still hurt? 


05:02.585 --> 05:07.590
Therefore, 
dispense with talking intensely. 


05:07.590 --> 05:11.460
Intense expressions 
really cause offense. 


05:11.460 --> 05:14.263
This makes sense, doesn’t it? 


05:14.263 --> 05:17.466
Intense talk is like a storm; 


05:17.467 --> 05:20.604
gentle talk 
like a pleasant breeze. 


05:20.603 --> 05:23.005
Intense talk is like a rock concert; 


05:23.005 --> 05:25.942
gentle talk like pleasant music. 


05:25.942 --> 05:29.612
Intense talk 
is like an avalanche or a blizzard; 


05:29.612 --> 05:34.217
gentle talk 
is like a beautiful, quiet snowfall. 


05:34.217 --> 05:39.222
Intense talk is like pouring 
a bucket of water on a newly planted flower; 


05:39.222 --> 05:42.292
gentle talk is like gentle rain. 


05:42.292 --> 05:47.164
So let’s all be gentle men 
and gentle women.


05:47.163 --> 05:50.833
How something is said 
is very important. 


05:50.833 --> 05:55.371
Paul wrote, and we can read that 
in Colossians 4:6, 


05:55.372 --> 05:59.609
a text that is generally well known, 
4:6 says: 


05:59.608 --> 06:04.613
“Let your words always be gracious, 
seasoned with salt, 


06:04.613 --> 06:09.618
so that you will know how 
you should answer [to each one].” 


06:09.618 --> 06:12.821
Endeavor to be gracious 


06:12.822 --> 06:17.494
in your tone of voice 
and word choice. 


06:17.493 --> 06:22.030
As a recipient of unloving words, 
resist the urge 


06:22.030 --> 06:26.102
to be sarcastic 
and keep your volume down. 


06:26.102 --> 06:29.872
But as The Watchtower said 
some time ago: 


06:29.872 --> 06:34.010
“Even whispered words 
can be argumentative 


06:34.010 --> 06:37.747
if they are irritating 
or demeaning.”


06:37.747 --> 06:40.617
Avoid hurtful accusations, 


06:40.617 --> 06:43.285
such as “You don’t care about me” 


06:43.285 --> 06:46.000
or “You never listen.” 


06:48.023 --> 06:52.895
Some are argumentative by nature 
or because of the way they were brought up. 


06:52.895 --> 06:57.900
Blurting out one’s views 
or feelings may be hurtful. 


06:57.900 --> 07:02.572
Yes, blurting leads 
to being hurtful. 


07:02.572 --> 07:06.709
Merriam Webster defines blurting: 


07:06.708 --> 07:08.710
“To say something suddenly 


07:08.710 --> 07:12.115
and without thinking 
about how people will react.” 


07:12.115 --> 07:15.718
Therefore, 
switch on the mind 


07:15.718 --> 07:19.188
before you start operating 
the mouth. 


07:19.188 --> 07:22.525
If hurt, 
why not excuse yourself 


07:22.525 --> 07:24.993
and walk away 
for a short while to cool down. 


07:24.993 --> 07:27.196
Go into another room 
or go for a walk 


07:27.197 --> 07:30.265
until you have regained 
your composure. 


07:30.265 --> 07:34.137
This is not the silent treatment. 


07:34.137 --> 07:39.142
This is a quote from the Awake! 
of 15th of December, 


07:39.142 --> 07:41.677
page 4. 


07:41.677 --> 07:46.282
Don’t let a grudge 
pull you into a sludge. 


07:46.282 --> 07:50.954
A grudge is also a robber; 
it robs us of peace of mind. 


07:50.953 --> 07:54.956
It’s like rust that slowly corrodes 
the body of a car. 


07:54.957 --> 07:58.294
The car’s outside 
may appear beautiful, 


07:58.293 --> 08:01.563
but under the paint 
there’s a problem. 


08:01.563 --> 08:05.100
Love keeps out resentment 
and grudges, 


08:05.100 --> 08:08.370
as a good roof 
keeps out rain. 


08:08.370 --> 08:11.173
And “love never fails.” 


08:11.173 --> 08:16.045
In fact, our love for Jehovah 
is tested by our love for our brothers.


08:16.045 --> 08:19.782
Here’s a scary quote 
from the Insight book, Volume 2, 


08:19.782 --> 08:22.885
page 1149: 


08:22.885 --> 08:26.022
An individual 
is condemned by God 


08:26.022 --> 08:30.694
if he bears a grudge 
for real or fancied wrongs 


08:30.693 --> 08:33.528
done to himself 
or to someone else. 


08:33.528 --> 08:38.266
It’s that serious. 
It means to be grieving the holy spirit. 


08:38.267 --> 08:43.105
Remember, 
we must forgive others. 


08:43.105 --> 08:45.140
That’s what the Bible says


08:45.140 --> 08:50.145
in Leviticus 19:18. 


08:50.145 --> 08:53.748
It says this: 


08:53.748 --> 08:58.486
“You must not take vengeance 
nor hold a grudge 


08:58.487 --> 09:00.624
against the sons 
of your people.” 


09:00.623 --> 09:02.691
But it doesn’t end there. 


09:02.692 --> 09:07.029
The second part of the verse 
is just as important. 


09:07.028 --> 09:09.398
It continues and says: 


09:09.398 --> 09:11.733
“You must love 


09:11.733 --> 09:14.803
“your fellow [man] as yourself. 


09:14.803 --> 09:17.540
I am Jehovah.”


09:17.540 --> 09:22.143
So we appreciate 
that “love never fails” 


09:22.143 --> 09:26.715
and will overcome 
any feelings of having 


09:26.715 --> 09:41.147
or harboring a grudge 
against somebody.

00:00:00 Now, there’s much for us
00:00:01 to think about in these words
00:00:03 of Proverbs 12:18.
00:00:05 And all of us, we like to think
00:00:07 of ourselves as wise.
00:00:09 But we all know that from time to time
00:00:11 we still stab our brothers and sisters
00:00:14 with our speech—thoughtless speech.
00:00:17 Now, we all know that we need to watch our speech
00:00:20 —say things that are positive or upbuilding.
00:00:22 But isn’t it true that sometimes we may find that we have ourselves
00:00:26 in a negative thinking pattern
00:00:28 that we cannot get out of and that exhibits itself in our speech?
00:00:32 Well, what can help us?
00:00:34 Well, you notice our theme scripture at Proverbs 12:18 says,
00:00:37 ‘The tongue of a wise person is a healing.’
00:00:41 So, what can help us to be wise?
00:00:43 What can help us to have healing and positive speech?
00:00:47 Well, let’s consider three things this morning.
00:00:49 The first is: Wise persons maintain perspective.
00:00:54 Now, sometimes we may find that our speech is negative or cutting
00:00:59 because we’re frustrated.
00:01:01 But yet stepping back and looking at things from a broader perspective,
00:01:05 many times can help us to be wise —to control our tongue.
00:01:10 Now, in this context, many times I think about Job.
00:01:14 When we look at Job’s words,
00:01:16 we find that he really said some hurtful things.
00:01:19 At Job 40:2, Jehovah calls Job a “faultfinder.”
00:01:24 Job was finding fault with Jehovah.
00:01:27 Why?
00:01:28 Well, from Job’s perspective, an injustice was being done.
00:01:31 In fact, turn, if you will, to Job chapter 9,
00:01:34 and just notice some of the things that Job says about Jehovah.
00:01:37 At Job 9:15-18, just skimming through there,
00:01:41 you’ll notice in verse 15, he says:
00:01:43 “Even if I were in the right, I would not answer him.”
00:01:46 Verse 18: ‘If I call out to him, will he answer me?
00:01:50 I do not believe he’ll even listen to my voice.’
00:01:52 Verse 17: “He crushes me with a storm.”
00:01:55 Verse 18: “He does not let me catch my breath.”
00:01:59 Look at verses 34 and 35; Job says of Jehovah:
00:02:02 “If he would [just] stop beating me . . . , then I would speak to him unafraid.”
00:02:07 Why, these words are stabs of a sword, stinging criticism of Jehovah.
00:02:12 But now, what helped Job to correct his thinking
00:02:15 and, therefore, again to have positive speech?
00:02:18 It was perspective.
00:02:20 Remember, Jehovah pulled him back to see things from a different perspective.
00:02:24 And how we think of the words there and His questions in Job chapter 38,
00:02:28 where Jehovah said: ‘Well, Job, let me ask you a few questions now.
00:02:31 ‘Can you remind me again,
00:02:33 ‘where was it you were at when I created the earth?
00:02:36 ‘I don’t remember seeing you anywhere.
00:02:38 ‘Or, who commands the morning?
00:02:40 ‘Or, Job, let me ask you, where does light come from?
00:02:43 ‘Ideas? Ideas?
00:02:44 I didn’t think so.’
00:02:46 See, what was Jehovah doing?
00:02:48 See, Jehovah was pulling Job back to see things from a broader perspective.
00:02:52 It allowed him to see his issues in context.
00:02:55 And what was the result?
00:02:57 Well, at Job 42:3, he said: “I spoke without understanding.”
00:03:01 In verse 6, he said: ‘Can you just take back everything I said;
00:03:04 just erase what I said.’
00:03:06 What’s the point?
00:03:08 Well, the point is that meditating on a broader perspective
00:03:11 can help us to have positive speech.
00:03:14 See, we have to remember that it’s not all about us.
00:03:16 The world does not revolve around us.
00:03:18 There are bigger issues at play,
00:03:20 and that perspective can help us to be wise.
00:03:23 It can help us to control our speech.
00:03:27 Now, a second point is that a wise person is humble.
00:03:31 Notice what a wise person will do.
00:03:33 Look at Proverbs 1:5.
00:03:37 Proverbs 1:5 says: “A wise person listens
00:03:41 and takes in more instruction.”
00:03:43 Now, it takes humility to listen.
00:03:46 Now, we contrast that with Proverbs 18:2.
00:03:50 Proverbs 18:2 says: “A stupid person takes no pleasure in understanding;
00:03:55 he would rather disclose what is in his heart.”
00:03:58 You see, a stupid person, he doesn’t have time to listen.
00:04:01 He already knows what the story is and therefore speaks accordingly.
00:04:05 Well, am I a wise or a stupid person?
00:04:09 Well, see, humility will help us to realize
00:04:11 that we do not always have the whole story;
00:04:14 we don’t always have all the facts.
00:04:16 And when we listen and we get a full perspective,
00:04:18 many times that changes our thinking.
00:04:20 How many times has that happened to you?
00:04:21 I know it’s happened to me.
00:04:23 That once we step back and we hear the whole story,
00:04:25 we realize we didn’t know what we were talking about.
00:04:28 We weren’t speaking out of wisdom, but rather out of ignorance.
00:04:32 And see, that realization and that humility will then help us do what it says
00:04:35 here at Proverbs 17:27.
00:04:38 Notice what a wise person does.
00:04:40 “A man of knowledge restrains his words,
00:04:42 and a discerning man will remain calm.”
00:04:45 So, what’s the point?
00:04:47 Well, the point is: Humility can help us to be wise.
00:04:51 Humble people listen to others,
00:04:54 therefore realizing that they don’t have all the facts.
00:04:57 And that helps us to restrain our words,  to remain calm, and to be wise.
00:05:02 Now, our third point is that a wise person is realistic.
00:05:06 And we have to be careful that we do not overthink things at times.
00:05:10 You see, in this organization we have
00:05:12 just absolutely brilliant brothers and sisters.
00:05:15 Many of you can look at a situation and see how to straighten it out
00:05:19 and make it faster, smoother, better, more efficient.
00:05:22 And that is a gift,
00:05:24 but we have to be careful that we do not overthink things.
00:05:27 See, sometimes we may look at something and say,
00:05:29 ‘Well, you know, that is the most ridiculous process I’ve ever seen in my life.’
00:05:32 And you know what? Maybe it is.
00:05:34 But we cannot optimize everything.
00:05:37 We’ll only end up frustrating ourselves, which will cause us to be cynical,
00:05:41 which ends up coming out in our speech.
00:05:44 Now, I find the book of Ecclesiastes of much benefit,
00:05:47 as it carries realistic thinking.
00:05:49 Look at Ecclesiastes 2:15.
00:05:55 Ecclesiastes 2:15 says: “Then I said in my heart:
00:05:58 “ ‘What happens to the stupid one will also happen to me.’
00:06:01 “What, then, did I gain by becoming excessively wise? . . .
00:06:05 ‘This too is futility.’ ’’
00:06:08 You see, we may have a better solution.
00:06:10 Good. Share it.
00:06:12 Share it with our oversight—be wise.
00:06:14 But Solomon is reminding us, ‘Do not be “excessively wise.” ’
00:06:18 Do not become so fixated on it that we start to become bitter,
00:06:21 which comes out in our speech.
00:06:24 As we’ve heard before, we cannot expect perfection
00:06:28 from an imperfect process where imperfect people are involved.
00:06:31 If we expect that, we’ll only end up frustrating ourselves and others.
00:06:35 We also remember that anyone can complain about an imperfect process.
00:06:39 That’s easy to do; all of us can do that.
00:06:41 But the real gem of a person
00:06:43 —the one that can be used  the most by Jehovah—
00:06:46 is the one who can take an imperfect process and make it work.
00:06:50 Now, along that line, we may think of Jesus.
00:06:52 He could have spent his last three and a half years of life here on earth
00:06:56 complaining to Jehovah, couldn’t he?
00:06:58 See, he could have complained about the imperfect men
00:07:01 that he had to work with.
00:07:02 He could have complained about the failed
00:07:04 religious structure that was in place.
00:07:06 He could have complained that he didn’t even have a decent place to live.
00:07:09 ‘Why, foxes and birds live better than I do.’
00:07:12 He could have complained about the flaws
00:07:14 in the temple arrangement and the synagogue.
00:07:16 There are many things that Jesus could have complained about,
00:07:19 and he could have become bitter.
00:07:21 This would have reflected itself in his speech.
00:07:23 But he didn’t do that.
00:07:25 See, Jesus is a beautiful example of taking an imperfect process
00:07:29 and still making it a success —making it work.
00:07:33 And so, therefore, this helped him to be positive,
00:07:36 this helped him to speak in a way that others said:
00:07:39 “Never has another man spoken like this.”
00:07:42 So, what’s the point?
00:07:44 Well, the point is that perspective,
00:07:46 humility, and being realistic
00:07:48 —this can help us to be wise
00:07:50 and this can help us to have healing and positive speech
00:07:54 with our dear brothers and sisters that we work with and we live with.

00:00.950 --> 00:03.520
When you look 
at the words in the way 


00:03.520 --> 00:06.588
that the apostle Paul worded things, 


00:06.588 --> 00:09.991
he said: “I live by faith 
in the Son of God, 


00:09.992 --> 00:13.697
who loved me 
and handed himself over for me.” 


00:13.697 --> 00:16.365
And we can really see 
the very personal nature 


00:16.365 --> 00:18.702
of the ransom to the apostle Paul. 


00:18.702 --> 00:20.704
And it’s important for us to do


00:20.703 --> 00:23.305
—as our commenters 
pointed out nicely—


00:23.305 --> 00:26.710
it is important for us 
to personalize the ransom. 


00:26.710 --> 00:30.447
The apostle Paul, in Hebrews 6:5, 


00:30.447 --> 00:32.782
showed the very personal nature; 


00:32.782 --> 00:34.784
he understood the personal nature 


00:34.783 --> 00:37.853
of the Bible and the ransom. 


00:37.853 --> 00:40.556
In Hebrews 6:5, 


00:40.557 --> 00:42.692
he uses this expression: 


00:42.692 --> 00:46.295
“And who have tasted 
the fine word of God 


00:46.295 --> 00:48.965
and powers 
of the coming system of things.” 


00:48.965 --> 00:51.100
Well, it’s interesting 
he used the word “taste.” 


00:51.100 --> 00:52.835
Taste is something very personal. 


00:52.835 --> 00:55.238
Somebody can’t taste 
something for you. 


00:55.238 --> 00:57.306
You have to put it 
in your mouth in order 


00:57.307 --> 00:59.409
to really know 
what it’s going to taste like.


00:59.408 --> 01:01.410
So, too, with the ransom. 


01:01.410 --> 01:04.447
And what practical ways 
can we “taste,” 


01:04.447 --> 01:06.649
or personalize, 
the ransom for us? 


01:06.648 --> 01:09.051
Let’s just consider 
a couple this morning.


01:09.052 --> 01:11.654
One is personal fears. 


01:11.653 --> 01:13.723
‘Does God really love me? 


01:13.723 --> 01:15.791
Am I worthy of love?’ 


01:15.792 --> 01:19.262
Sometimes the “what-ifs” 
and their cousins, the “could-bes,” 


01:19.262 --> 01:22.665
they come to live and never leave. 


01:22.665 --> 01:26.202
You know, if bad things 
or trials or difficulties happen to us, 


01:26.202 --> 01:30.005
we begin to reason, 
‘Well, Jehovah God maybe doesn’t love me.’


01:30.005 --> 01:32.008
There’s really strong reason for us 


01:32.008 --> 01:34.143
to somehow believe 
in cause and effect. 


01:34.143 --> 01:37.180
We see the cause of things and effect,
and so after a while, 


01:37.180 --> 01:40.317
everything that happens to us, 
we begin to look at some cause 


01:40.317 --> 01:42.985
and even begin to think 
that maybe Jehovah 


01:42.985 --> 01:45.388
doesn’t love us. 


01:45.388 --> 01:47.856
Even if we’re a good person 


01:47.857 --> 01:51.127
and bad things happen to us, 
we begin to wonder, 


01:51.127 --> 01:53.564
‘Others my age are healthy.’ 


01:53.563 --> 01:56.631
Some leaving 
or changing assignments, 


01:56.632 --> 01:58.769
you hear everything 
falls into place 


01:58.768 --> 02:00.770
for them within a few weeks. 


02:00.770 --> 02:04.373
‘I’m still looking for a job. 
I’m still looking for work.’ 


02:04.373 --> 02:07.110
In other words, 
do not try to reason 


02:07.110 --> 02:09.512
that just because things 
don’t work out perfectly 


02:09.512 --> 02:11.580
that Jehovah doesn’t love us. 


02:11.580 --> 02:12.782
It’s not true. 


02:12.782 --> 02:15.452
We can still be doing very, 
very good things, 


02:15.452 --> 02:18.454
and yet some difficulties 
can face us.


02:18.453 --> 02:20.456
For example, 
you’re driving down the road, 


02:20.457 --> 02:22.659
obeying all the traffic laws. 


02:22.658 --> 02:25.728
You pull up to a red light, 
you stop, 


02:25.728 --> 02:28.330
it turns green, you go through it, 
and you get broadsided 


02:28.330 --> 02:32.502
by some knucklehead who went 
through the red light on the other side.


02:32.502 --> 02:34.970
Well, that’s not your fault. 


02:34.970 --> 02:37.007
Are you going to say: 
“Well, you know what? 


02:37.007 --> 02:40.009
I’m not going to obey traffic laws anymore.
See, it doesn’t pay!” 


02:40.008 --> 02:41.276
Well, no! 


02:41.277 --> 02:45.815
It was his fault for running 
through the traffic light. 


02:45.815 --> 02:49.518
And sometimes bad, or difficult, 
things can happen to us. 


02:49.518 --> 02:51.520
It’s not our fault 


02:51.520 --> 02:53.990
or it’s not any sign 
that Jehovah doesn’t love us. 


02:53.990 --> 02:56.592
So how can reflecting 
on the ransom help us 


02:56.592 --> 02:59.462
when we have these kinds 
of personal fears?


02:59.462 --> 03:02.399
Well, we could start with, 
Why do we have the ransom? 


03:02.398 --> 03:04.833
Well, because some very bad things 


03:04.833 --> 03:06.835
were happening 
to some good people


03:06.835 --> 03:09.838
—us—
Adam and Eve’s descendants. 


03:09.838 --> 03:12.741
I mean, 
Adam sinned and Eve sinned, 


03:12.742 --> 03:14.744
yet we suffer. 


03:14.743 --> 03:17.413
The ransom is Jehovah’s solution 


03:17.413 --> 03:19.448
for those who appreciate it. 


03:19.448 --> 03:21.450
It’s his way of telling us, 


03:21.450 --> 03:23.452
‘I know bad things are happening, 


03:23.452 --> 03:25.722
and I’m working to fix it.’ 


03:25.722 --> 03:28.224
Yes, when we reflect 
on the reason 


03:28.223 --> 03:30.860
why Jehovah God 
gave us the ransom, 


03:30.860 --> 03:33.328
it helps us to know 
that Jehovah knows we suffer 


03:33.328 --> 03:36.731
from cancer and old age 
and the sins and mistakes of others 


03:36.732 --> 03:39.435
and even our own imperfections. 


03:39.435 --> 03:42.305
See, tasting of the ransom in this way 


03:42.305 --> 03:44.973
means we’ll not get the feeling 


03:44.973 --> 03:47.976
that Jehovah doesn’t love us 
when trials befall us. 


03:47.977 --> 03:50.414
To the contrary, the ransom 


03:50.413 --> 03:54.416
is the greatest expression 
of Jehovah’s and Jesus’ love for us 


03:54.417 --> 03:58.420
and their desire to fix 
the current mess we live in now.


03:58.420 --> 04:00.557
How about, 
let’s consider a second way 


04:00.557 --> 04:02.759
that we could reflect 
on the ransom, 


04:02.758 --> 04:06.295
and that is the death 
of someone close to us. 


04:06.295 --> 04:09.432
Anyone who’s had someone 
very close to them die 


04:09.432 --> 04:12.502
knows the very helpless feeling 
that you have, 


04:12.502 --> 04:16.239
knowing that there’s 
really nothing you can do. 


04:16.238 --> 04:19.475
In that instant when they die, 
your hope


04:19.475 --> 04:23.478
—your faith in the resurrection 
based on the ransom—


04:23.478 --> 04:27.000
becomes more real to you 
than any time in your entire life. 


04:28.217 --> 04:31.254
In Acts 17:31, 


04:31.253 --> 04:34.656
in a beautiful speech 
that the apostle Paul gave, 


04:34.657 --> 04:36.659
he highlights 


04:36.658 --> 04:39.395
that Jesus’ death 


04:39.395 --> 04:42.465
and resurrection and the ransom 
was really a guarantee 


04:42.465 --> 04:44.500
that we have. 


04:44.500 --> 04:48.170
Here in Acts 17:31, 


04:48.170 --> 04:51.340
he says: “Because he has set a day 
on which he purposes 


04:51.340 --> 04:54.043
“to judge the inhabited earth 
in righteousness 


04:54.043 --> 04:56.711
“by a man 
whom he has appointed, 


04:56.712 --> 04:59.382
“and he has provided 
a guarantee 


04:59.382 --> 05:02.919
“to all men 
by resurrecting him 


05:02.918 --> 05:04.953
from the dead.” 


05:04.953 --> 05:07.156
So personalizing the ransom 


05:07.157 --> 05:09.259
and all that it makes possible 


05:09.258 --> 05:12.861
helps us to know that the resurrection is, 
not just possible, 


05:12.862 --> 05:15.865
but that Jehovah 
and Jesus want to resurrect 


05:15.865 --> 05:17.933
our mother, our father, 


05:17.933 --> 05:21.470
our beloved husband or a wife. 


05:21.470 --> 05:24.240
They care about each person 


05:24.240 --> 05:27.177
that has ever lived or died 


05:27.177 --> 05:29.845
and know them 
so intimately and so completely 


05:29.845 --> 05:32.915
that they can resurrect them completely 
with all their memories 


05:32.915 --> 05:36.252
and personality completely 
as we knew them. 


05:36.252 --> 05:38.722
I mean, how much more personal 


05:38.722 --> 05:42.059
could God’s love for us 
become than that?


05:42.058 --> 05:45.695
You know, to bring our loved ones 
back from the dead 


05:45.695 --> 05:48.163
is the ultimate statement 


05:48.163 --> 05:50.966
of Jehovah’s personal interest 


05:50.967 --> 05:54.670
in each and every human being. 


05:54.670 --> 05:58.340
We are not just collateral damage 


05:58.340 --> 06:01.010
in Satan’s war on Jehovah. 


06:01.010 --> 06:03.378
The ransom is the way 


06:03.378 --> 06:05.848
that Jehovah plans 
to undo all the harm 


06:05.848 --> 06:07.850
that Satan has caused 


06:07.850 --> 06:10.920
since the death of Adam and Eve. 


06:10.920 --> 06:14.423
In fact, the resurrection 
is really Jehovah’s way 


06:14.423 --> 06:16.991
of proving all of Satan’s lies 


06:16.992 --> 06:19.129
completely false. 


06:19.128 --> 06:21.796
When you think about it today, 
Satan can perpetrate 


06:21.797 --> 06:24.600
all kinds of lies about what happens 
to people after they die. 


06:24.600 --> 06:26.068
‘They’re going to go here, 
they’re going to go there, 


06:26.068 --> 06:28.670
‘they’re going to go to some afterlife, 
they’re going to go to some paradise, 


06:28.670 --> 06:31.473
they’re going to come back 
as some animal.’ 


06:31.473 --> 06:33.508
But in the new world, 


06:33.508 --> 06:35.711
when the vast majority of people 


06:35.712 --> 06:38.915
have been resurrected, 


06:38.915 --> 06:42.118
that lie isn’t going 
to be sold anymore. 


06:42.118 --> 06:44.386
Each one can tell everyone 


06:44.387 --> 06:46.522
what happened to them 
when they died


06:46.522 --> 06:48.792
—nothing, 


06:48.792 --> 06:51.127
no afterlife. 


06:51.127 --> 06:55.030
Everyone will know 
that it’s nonexistence. 


06:55.030 --> 06:57.233
That lie won’t work. 


06:57.233 --> 06:59.501
See, Jehovah knew 


06:59.502 --> 07:02.372
that we would hurt terribly 


07:02.372 --> 07:04.440
at the death of loved ones, 


07:04.440 --> 07:07.210
so he gave us the ransom 


07:07.210 --> 07:09.412
as his way of telling us, 


07:09.412 --> 07:13.082
‘I know it hurts, 
but please know 


07:13.082 --> 07:16.852
that I have 
the perfect solution in mind.’


07:16.852 --> 07:19.655
Now, we’ve just considered two ways 


07:19.655 --> 07:21.723
to reflect and meditate on the ransom, 


07:21.723 --> 07:24.726
like the apostle Paul did, 
to really personalize it. 


07:24.727 --> 07:26.995
We just talked about personal fears 


07:26.995 --> 07:30.198
and the resurrection, 


07:30.198 --> 07:32.501
the death of someone close to us. 


07:32.502 --> 07:34.904
Imagine how many more ways 


07:34.903 --> 07:37.340
we can benefit today 


07:37.340 --> 07:39.342
from meditating on the ransom 


07:39.342 --> 07:53.640
and how it affects us personally.

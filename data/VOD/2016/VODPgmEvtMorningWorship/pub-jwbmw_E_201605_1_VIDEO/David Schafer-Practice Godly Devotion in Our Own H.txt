00:00 Many of us are concerned  about how to care well for aging parents,
00:05 not only because of what it says  in the quoted portion of today’s text
00:08 but also because of the phrase  at the end of 1 Timothy 5:4.
00:13 If you tap the citation  at the end of today’s text,
00:16 you get the rest of the verse, namely,
00:18 “for this is acceptable  in God’s sight.”
00:23 And that tells us  just how important a matter this is.
00:26 Notice the Interlinear rendering.
00:28 The term translated  “godly devotion” is literally
00:31 “to be revering well,”  which could denote
00:35 being generally virtuous  toward anyone.
00:38 And perhaps that’s why  a number of translations
00:40 in our list here in JW Library
00:43 simply say “to show piety.”
00:45 Still others,  such as The Jerusalem Bible,
00:48 render the term  “to do their duty.”
00:51 But honoring our parents
00:53 is more than just  our duty toward humans.
00:56 It’s more than just virtue  for its own sake.
00:59 The verse itself says,  “this is acceptable in God’s sight.”
01:03 So we love our parents, yes.  They deserve our care, yes.
01:07 That’s virtuous, of course.
01:09 But principally,  we care for our aging parents
01:12 because we revere Jehovah.
01:14 We care about what Jehovah  says is right conduct
01:17 toward family members.
01:19 It’s a matter  of godly devotion.
01:21 So, what are some  of the factors to keep in mind?
01:23 Our commenters  have helped us so much.
01:26 The comments point out
01:28 that “exactly how  children provide care varies”
01:32 because situations vary.
01:36 But here are four  practical things we can do.
01:38 First, communicate.
01:39 Second,  determine the real needs.
01:43 Third,  have reasonable expectations.
01:48 And fourth, always remember  to throw your burden on Jehovah.
01:52 First, turn, please,  to Proverbs chapter 15
01:56 and verse 22.
01:59 Communicate,  communicate, communicate.
02:02 And what does this result in?
02:04 It says:
02:06 “Plans fail when there is  no consultation,
02:11 “but there is  accomplishment
02:13 through many advisers.”
02:17 So keep in touch —call, write, email, text, Skype
02:21 —once a week, more often,  especially as they age.
02:25 Satisfy their spiritual needs.
02:27 Keep them apprised  of what is going on at Bethel
02:30 and the rich treasures  you enjoy here in your service.
02:33 Care for their emotional needs  by reminding them
02:35 just how valuable they are.
02:38 But regarding  their material needs,
02:40 it’s important to ask  the right questions.
02:43 It’s easy to conclude  they’re doing OK.
02:46 But this is where  the many advisors come in.
02:48 Keep in touch with other family members,  the local congregation.
02:51 Get the whole story.
02:53 True, the sheer multiplicity  of counselors
02:55 doesn’t in itself  guarantee accurate data.
02:58 A majority can be wrong.
03:00 That’s why Exodus 23:2 cautions us  against just going along with the crowd.
03:05 However, when we’re trying  to make important decisions,
03:08 we need to get a clear picture  of what’s actually going on in their lives.
03:12 And that leads to our second point:  Determine the real needs.
03:15 Notice what it says here  in Proverbs 14:15.
03:20 Some parents have made  wise provision for their old age
03:23 —pensions, insurance,  retirement funds.
03:25 But what if these run out,  then what?
03:29 Time to quit?  Get a house?
03:32 It’s good  that we honor our parents,
03:34 and never would we want  to treat them with contempt.
03:36 That’s exactly  what Jesus condemned.
03:39 And yet, in some cases,
03:42 we have to think  about what it says
03:46 in Proverbs 14:15.
03:48 Notice what  it says at the end:
03:50 “The shrewd one  ponders each step.”
03:54 Family Happiness, page 176
03:57 raises 11 pertinent questions.
04:00 It says: ‘Suppose . . . your elderly mother  is having difficulty living alone
04:04 ‘and you think she might benefit  from moving in with you . . .
04:07 ‘You might consider . . . :  What are her actual needs?
04:10 ‘Are there private  or state-sponsored support services
04:13 ‘that offer an acceptable  alternative solution?
04:15 ‘Does she want to move?
04:19 ‘If she does, in what ways  will her life be affected?
04:22 ‘Will she have to leave  friends behind?
04:25 ‘How might this  affect her emotionally?
04:28 ‘Have you talked  these things over with her?
04:31 ‘How might such a move  affect you, your mate . . . ?
04:34 ‘If your mother needs care,  who will provide it?
04:38 ‘Can the responsibility  be shared?
04:39 Have you discussed the matter  with all those directly involved?’
04:44 In one of the most touching  accounts on this subject,
04:47 John 19:26, 27,
04:51 we read that Jesus
04:54 when he “saw his mother
04:57 “and the disciple whom he loved  standing nearby, he said to his mother:
05:01 “‘Woman, see!  Your son!’
05:03 “Next he said  to the disciple: ‘See!
05:05 “Your mother!’
05:07 “And from that hour on,
05:09 the disciple took her  into his own home.”
05:12 Yes, despite all that was weighing
05:15 on Jesus’ shoulders  at that precise moment,
05:17 not to mention  the incredible pain he was enduring,
05:21 he took the time  to take care of his mother.
05:23 But what did he do?
05:24 Did he summon
12 legions of angels
05:27 and postpone his execution?
05:29 No, he delegated responsibility
05:32 to a relative  and not his brothers,
05:36 because they apparently  were not yet believers.
05:39 What an amazing example  of balancing the real needs
05:44 of all concerned!
05:46 Well, that brings us  to our third point:
05:49 Have reasonable expectations  of our parents,
05:53 of our relatives,  of the congregation.
05:56 First Corinthians 16:14 says:  “Let everything you do
06:01 be done with love” —beautiful text.
06:06 Now the responsibility  rests primarily
06:09 upon each Christian  to care for his own household.
06:12 Children, grandchildren,  other close relatives
06:14 display Christian love  by providing assistance
06:17 to the elderly and infirm ones  according to their needs.
06:20 But congregations  of Jehovah’s Witnesses
06:23 do not weaken
06:26 this personal responsibility  by taking over.
06:30 The Bethel family is really  to be commended for the variety of ways
06:34 in which you are shouldering  this very heavy responsibility.
06:37 How this must please Jehovah!
06:39 And that leads  to our final point:
06:42 Remember to throw  your burdens on Jehovah.
06:46 As pointed out in our comments,  Jehovah “can bless
06:51 “any Scriptural decision
06:54 and make it work.”
06:57 How encouraging  those words are!
06:59 And then it cites  Numbers 11:23:
07:03 ‘The hand of Jehovah  is not short.’
07:06 Only our lack  of trust in Jehovah
07:10 would limit  what he will do for us.
07:13 And although  Jehovah can work miracles,
07:16 we don’t expect that we will never  have to participate in the solution
07:20 of giving care  to our aging parents.
07:22 Why not?
07:23 Because by learning to ‘practice  godly devotion in our own households,’
07:26 we have the opportunity  to show the depth
07:30 of our unselfish motives  in serving Jehovah,
07:33 and that proves  the Devil a liar.
07:35 Nevertheless,  notice this encouraging promise
07:38 at Psalm 145:18:
07:43 “Jehovah is near  to all those calling on him,
07:47 “to all who call  on him in truth.
07:49 “He satisfies the desire  of those who fear him;
07:53 “he hears their cry for help,
07:55 and he rescues them.”
07:58 Jehovah helps.
08:00 Maybe you yourself  are the instrument
08:03 in Jehovah’s hands to make sure  that your parents are well cared for.
08:06 Your work  may actually be the expression
08:09 of Jehovah’s love in answer  to your parent’s prayers.

00:00 How can we be sure
00:03 that we will give a word at the right time?
00:06 Well, one of the things  that will help us is described
00:09 by the apostle Paul in the book
00:11 of the first letter to the Corinthians.
00:14 If you turn with me, please,  to 1 Corinthians chapter 12,
00:17 and verse 25,
00:20 notice what Paul says to them:
00:22 “So that there should be  no division in the body,
00:26 “but its members should have  mutual concern
00:29 for one another.”
00:31 So notice that comment there,
00:33 “mutual concern for one another.”
00:36 If you look  at the [Kingdom] Interlinear,
00:39 you’ll notice that literally  the Greek says there
00:42 “to be anxious over one another.”
00:47 And it’s interesting  also for us to note
00:50 that this Greek word  translated here,
00:53 “mutual concern,”
00:55 is the same basic word
00:58 that’s used  in the book of Matthew
01:00 when recording what Jesus said
01:02 about not being anxious  about anything.
01:05 So that seems  a little unusual, doesn’t it?
01:08 Jesus tells us not to be anxious,
01:10 and yet Paul here tells us
01:12 to be anxious for one another.
01:15 How does that work?
01:17 Well, obviously, this word
01:19 has different meanings  or different connotations
01:22 in different settings.
01:24 It’s wrong for us to be anxious
01:27 about material things,
01:29 particularly if it shows  a lack of faith on our part.
01:32 But on the other hand,  it’s appropriate
01:34 that we should be anxious  or show concern
01:37 —a wholesome concern— that motivates us to action
01:40 when we’re dealing  with our brothers and sisters.
01:43 If you turn over  to the book of Philippians,
01:47 you’ll notice that Paul uses
01:49 the same Greek word  when describing Timothy
01:52 at Philippians 2:20.
01:57 There he says:  “For I have no one else
02:00 “of a disposition like his
02:02 “who will genuinely care
02:05 for your concerns.”
02:07 So this expression  “genuinely care”
02:10 —the “care” part of it— is the same Greek word
02:13 about being anxious for others.
02:16 And, of course,  that’s the same Greek word
02:19 that Paul used  in Philippians 4:6
02:22 where he said:  “Do not be anxious over anything.”
02:26 Now at this point,  you’re probably thinking:
02:29 ‘How does this all work?
02:31 ‘The same Greek word,  and yet we’re told
02:33 ‘not to be anxious,  and yet at the same time
02:36 we’re told to be anxious  for one another.’
02:39 Well, maybe we could illustrate it
02:41 with the English word “jealousy.”
02:45 Normally,  the connotation we would get
02:47 from the word “jealousy”  is something negative,
02:50 but in certain situations  or circumstances
02:54 it can have a positive  or proper description.
02:58 Perhaps let’s take  a husband or a wife
03:01 who finds out that their mate
03:03 is starting to have  a wrong romantic attachment
03:07 to someone else.
03:08 Well, shouldn’t they have  a feeling of jealousy?
03:11 If they don’t,  there’s something wrong.
03:13 So in that situation,
03:15 jealousy is positive.
03:17 Well, in a similar way,
03:19 it’s wrong for us to be anxious
03:21 about material things,
03:23 trying to get ahead in the world,  and so on.
03:26 But it’s appropriate
03:28 that we have a wholesome,
03:30 positive anxiety or concern
03:33 for one another.
03:35 So, what is this positive,
03:37 wholesome concern?
03:39 Well, first of all,  let’s say what it isn’t.
03:42 First Peter 4:15,
03:45 you can check on that later,  but I’m sure you remember,
03:48 it says we should not be  “a busybody.”
03:51 So this anxious concern  doesn’t mean
03:54 that we’re trying to find out  everything about this person.
03:57 Then, also, 1 Timothy 5:13
04:02 speaks of “gossipers . . .
04:04 meddlers  in other people’s affairs.”
04:07 So if we were to be anxious  in that regard,
04:10 that would be negative.
04:12 It wouldn’t be appropriate,  would it?
04:15 So how can we show  this wholesome concern
04:19 or anxiety for one another?
04:22 Well, over the years,  The Watchtower has made
04:24 many comments on this.
04:26 But perhaps we could say  there are four different things
04:29 that we could do that would show  this mutual concern.
04:33 The first one is
04:35 to take personal interest  in others.
04:38 Yes, genuine interest,  not just asking them,
04:41 “How are you?”  and not waiting for an answer
04:44 but trying to see  what’s happening in their lives
04:48 and show concern for them.
04:51 The second way  is by noting things
04:55 that they do or say  that we can commend
04:57 and then encourage them.
04:59 So looking for opportunities  to encourage one another
05:03 is another way that we show  that we have this mutual concern.
05:08 The third way  that was mentioned
05:10 in our text comments  this morning
05:12 is that we need to try and see
05:14 the potential  in others for good.
05:18 We can think  of the example of Barnabas.
05:22 Remember, Mark disappointed
05:25 both Barnabas and Paul  during the first missionary journey,
05:29 and yet Barnabas  didn’t give up on him.
05:32 He saw there was some potential there for Mark to be better,
05:36 to be used in a more interesting way  in the future.
05:40 So Barnabas  encouraged that quality
05:44 in Mark, and, of course,  we realize what the result was.
05:47 Later Mark was very useful  not only to Barnabas
05:51 but also to Paul, and,  of course, he had the privilege
05:54 of writing an account  of Jesus’ life.
05:57 So, what a wonderful privilege he had.
05:59 So like Barnabas,  we need to look at younger ones,
06:02 newer ones,  and even everybody
06:05 to see if we can see  potential for improvement
06:09 and then encourage them  to be able to reach out
06:12 for further activity.
06:14 The fourth point  we’d like to mention
06:16 is the need for us to show  confidence in others.
06:21 The apostle Paul  was a good example of this.
06:25 If we take our Bibles  and turn to the book of Hebrews,
06:29 and you remember  when Paul was writing
06:31 to the Hebrew Christians,
06:34 there were many things he had  to mention that were negative.
06:37 For example,  some were drifting away;
06:40 they were distracted.
06:42 Others had allowed  their hearts to harden.
06:46 Yet others  really were still immature
06:49 when it came  to Christian living.
06:51 They were feeding, as it were,  on ‘the milk of the word.’
06:54 They couldn’t eat properly  in a spiritual sense.
06:58 So those things could have perhaps  played on Paul’s mind,
07:02 and perhaps he could have become quite negative.
07:05 But notice in Hebrews 10:39
07:10 what Paul says  to these brothers and sisters,
07:14 Hebrews 10:39:
07:17 “Now we are not the sort  who shrink back to destruction,
07:21 but the sort who have faith  for the preserving of our lives.”
07:25 Now, isn’t that  a positive comment?
07:27 A positive comment  made to those
07:30 who perhaps  were neglecting to do
07:33 certain things  that they should have done.
07:35 And we notice there too  that Paul says:
07:37 “Now we are not the sort.”
07:39 So he includes himself  along with these other brothers.
07:44 How could Paul  have such confidence
07:47 when writing  to those who needed
07:49 such a lot of counsel?
07:52 Well, The Watchtower  made two points.
07:54 It said:  First of all, Paul tried;
07:57 he endeavored to imitate  the viewpoint of Jehovah God.
08:01 Jehovah looks  at imperfect humans,
08:03 he sees their potential,
08:05 and he has confidence
08:07 that if they want  to do what’s right,
08:10 with his help  they’ll be able to do it.
08:13 And the second area
08:15 that Paul was able  to trust in was holy spirit.
08:19 He realized  that with holy spirit,
08:22 someone can gain the power  beyond what is normal
08:26 and overcome all sorts  of fleshly desires and problems.
08:30 So those two reasons then
08:33 —Paul’s endeavoring  to imitate Jehovah
08:35 and also his belief  in the power of holy spirit
08:38 —helped him to be confident,
08:41 to be positive with regard
08:43 to those brothers and sisters.
08:45 So, what can we see with regard
08:47 to us giving a good word  at the right time?
08:50 Well, we need to have  mutual concern for one another.
08:55 Not the type of concern  that we’re busybodies
08:58 or meddlers  in other people’s affairs.
09:00 But what were  those four points?
09:02 First of all,  take personal interest in others,
09:05 commend and encourage them,
09:07 see the potential in them for good,
09:10 and then express confidence.
09:12 If we do that,  then we can be sure
09:15 that in a positive way  each one of us
09:17 is showing mutual concern.

00:00.917 --> 00:03.587
“Well, there’ve been so many changes. 


00:03.587 --> 00:05.822
It’s hard to keep up.” 


00:05.822 --> 00:07.824
We hear that a lot. 


00:07.823 --> 00:09.825
And it’s true. 


00:09.825 --> 00:13.930
So the question is, 
How do these changes come about? 


00:13.930 --> 00:17.933
Does the Governing Body get together 
on a Wednesday morning and say, 


00:17.933 --> 00:20.203
“Well, what will we change 
this week? 


00:20.203 --> 00:23.706
Let’s throw the brotherhood 
off guard a little bit.” 


00:23.707 --> 00:28.277
That would not be 
faithful or discreet.


00:28.277 --> 00:30.280
The fact is that, 


00:30.280 --> 00:33.817
although changes may seem 
to be announced one after another, 


00:33.817 --> 00:37.220
the decision to put 
the changes into effect 


00:37.220 --> 00:40.723
is often years in the making. 


00:40.723 --> 00:44.226
Now, one of the first big changes 


00:44.227 --> 00:47.230
that the current Governing Body 
had to grapple with 


00:47.230 --> 00:49.232
had to do with this, 


00:49.232 --> 00:51.234
Is it feasible 


00:51.233 --> 00:54.236
to have a Branch Committee serving 


00:54.237 --> 00:56.239
in the United States? 


00:56.238 --> 01:00.443
Now, for years the thought was 
that we really couldn’t have 


01:00.443 --> 01:02.678
a Branch Committee 
functioning in the United States 


01:02.678 --> 01:05.481
because the States was host 


01:05.482 --> 01:09.652
to the Governing Body 
and the world headquarters. 


01:09.652 --> 01:13.155
So this was going to be 
a big decision, 


01:13.155 --> 01:16.325
and it wasn’t taken overnight. 


01:16.325 --> 01:18.327
A lot of consultation 


01:18.327 --> 01:22.332
with mature, 
experienced brothers was necessary. 


01:22.332 --> 01:24.600
But finally the decision was made, 


01:24.600 --> 01:28.938
and we believe that decision 
has had Jehovah’s rich blessing. 


01:28.938 --> 01:33.476
We’re proud 
of our hard-working Branch Committee, 


01:33.477 --> 01:35.845
and we’re happy 
to have their support. 


01:35.845 --> 01:38.582
We need their support.


01:38.582 --> 01:42.319
Now let’s consider 
a couple of other examples. 


01:42.318 --> 01:45.921
Beginning in the first week 
of January 2009, 


01:45.922 --> 01:47.924
the School, Service Meeting, 


01:47.923 --> 01:50.793
and the Congregation Book Study 
were merged. 


01:50.793 --> 01:52.795
Now that decision 


01:52.795 --> 01:56.598
was almost ten years 
in the making. 


01:56.598 --> 02:01.103
As far back as 1999, 
it was being discussed. 


02:01.103 --> 02:05.608
Well, then, why wasn’t the decision 
made ten years earlier? 


02:05.608 --> 02:08.678
Because the Governing Body 
wanted to be sure. 


02:08.678 --> 02:10.680
Will the brothers 
have what they need? 


02:10.680 --> 02:13.683
Will they have 
all of the spiritual food they need 


02:13.683 --> 02:16.018
if we merge the meetings?


02:16.018 --> 02:17.786
Now then one Wednesday


02:17.787 --> 02:19.955
—I think it was 
about three-thirty in the afternoon—


02:19.955 --> 02:22.392
we’d had a long meeting. 


02:22.392 --> 02:26.997
We received two letters 
from large branches. 


02:26.997 --> 02:31.000
And one of the branches said 
that they had many large congregations 


02:31.000 --> 02:33.537
with seven or eight book studies, 


02:33.537 --> 02:36.974
but with only one elder 
and one ministerial servant. 


02:36.973 --> 02:39.275
So the elder might conduct 
five book studies, 


02:39.275 --> 02:41.643
and the ministerial servant 
might conduct three, 


02:41.643 --> 02:44.846
and then they had all of the parts 
on the meetings to prepare. 


02:44.847 --> 02:48.519
So all they were doing with their time 
was conducting book studies 


02:48.518 --> 02:51.253
and preparing parts 
for the meetings. 


02:51.253 --> 02:53.255
It was hard! 


02:53.255 --> 02:56.558
And then the same week we received 
a letter from another branch, 


02:56.558 --> 03:00.863
and they explained why the attendance 
at the book study was so low. 


03:00.863 --> 03:03.833
They explained that the publishers 
loved the meetings


03:03.833 --> 03:06.701
—all of the meetings—
including the book study. 


03:06.702 --> 03:11.507
But they’re very poor, 
and they couldn’t afford the bus fare 


03:11.507 --> 03:15.779
to attend two midweek meetings; 
they had to choose. 


03:15.778 --> 03:18.781
And if they attended 
the School and Service Meeting, 


03:18.782 --> 03:21.952
they could get almost two hours 
of spiritual direction, 


03:21.952 --> 03:25.255
whereas with the book study, 
they would get one. 


03:25.255 --> 03:27.690
So most of the time 
it was the School 


03:27.690 --> 03:30.593
and Service Meeting 
that won out. 


03:30.593 --> 03:33.228
Well, those two letters 


03:33.228 --> 03:36.731
put a real face 
on the situation, 


03:36.732 --> 03:39.769
and it helped us 
to make the decision.


03:39.768 --> 03:41.938
Now, in 2008, 


03:41.938 --> 03:44.506
a public edition 
and a study edition 


03:44.507 --> 03:47.644
of The Watchtower 
began to be published. 


03:47.643 --> 03:51.813
That decision was 
a long time coming. 


03:51.813 --> 03:55.451
We discussed the possibility off and on, 
but we always said, 


03:55.452 --> 03:57.954
“Let’s not be hasty; 
let’s wait a little bit. 


03:57.953 --> 03:59.955
Let’s see what Jehovah wants.” 


03:59.955 --> 04:03.392
The main thing was, 
What would Jehovah want? 


04:03.392 --> 04:05.395
And how would we know? 


04:05.395 --> 04:09.365
We decided to make 
a sort of fleece test. 


04:09.365 --> 04:11.600
And so in 2006, 


04:11.600 --> 04:14.837
we began publishing 
one Awake! a month, 


04:14.837 --> 04:16.974
but we kept publishing 
two Watchtowers. 


04:16.973 --> 04:20.710
So that would be three magazines 
per month, instead of four.


04:20.710 --> 04:23.813
And the rationale was, 
“We’ll try it for a year,


04:23.813 --> 04:25.815
“and if at the end of a year 


04:25.815 --> 04:28.217
“our magazine placements 
have plummeted, 


04:28.217 --> 04:31.054
“we’ll know that Jehovah 
is not backing this arrangement. 


04:31.053 --> 04:34.956
We can go back to producing 
two Awakes! a year.” 


04:34.957 --> 04:36.994
Well, what was the result? 


04:36.993 --> 04:38.995
At the end of the year, 


04:38.995 --> 04:42.865
we were placing 
as many magazines at three per month 


04:42.865 --> 04:47.103
as we had been placing 
at four per month the year before. 


04:47.103 --> 04:49.405
So that indicated to us 


04:49.405 --> 04:51.740
that Jehovah 
was backing the arrangement. 


04:51.740 --> 04:53.743
And how many 
of us have appreciated 


04:53.743 --> 04:55.945
having a study edition 
of The Watchtower 


04:55.945 --> 04:58.080
that speaks directly 
to the brotherhood 


04:58.080 --> 05:00.517
and then a public edition 
of The Watchtower 


05:00.517 --> 05:02.852
that can be tailored 
a little bit more 


05:02.852 --> 05:05.422
to the needs of the public.


05:05.422 --> 05:08.290
Now, before making 
any decision 


05:08.290 --> 05:10.292
that affects 
the Kingdom work, 


05:10.292 --> 05:13.229
the Governing Body 
has to carefully consider 


05:13.228 --> 05:15.465
the spiritual implications. 


05:15.465 --> 05:18.735
As an example, 
in 2008, 


05:18.735 --> 05:22.538
the decision was made to reduce 
the length of public talks 


05:22.538 --> 05:25.841
from 45 minutes 
to 30 minutes. 


05:25.842 --> 05:29.312
Well you say, ‘How could 
that decision possibly affect 


05:29.312 --> 05:32.249
the spirituality 
of the brotherhood?’ 


05:32.248 --> 05:36.751
And if you’re serving 
in an urban congregation with many elders 


05:36.752 --> 05:40.089
and nearby there are other 
urban congregations with many elders, 


05:40.088 --> 05:43.793
perhaps you’d have difficulty 
in understanding the reasoning. 


05:43.793 --> 05:47.230
But the Governing Body 
has to look at the whole picture. 


05:47.230 --> 05:51.567
Thousands of our brothers 
have served where the need is great, 


05:51.567 --> 05:53.469
and they’ve learned 
a foreign language. 


05:53.468 --> 05:55.871
And in many, many 
of these congregations 


05:55.872 --> 05:58.007
the learners are the elders.


05:58.007 --> 06:00.309
Some of the learners 
have told us 


06:00.308 --> 06:03.578
that for every minute 
of a public talk, 


06:03.578 --> 06:07.050
it has required one hour 
of preparation. 


06:07.050 --> 06:10.420
So can you imagine: 
45-minute public talk


06:10.420 --> 06:12.888
—45 hours for some of them? 


06:12.888 --> 06:16.691
So the reduction in the length 
of the public talks has actually meant 


06:16.692 --> 06:20.329
that these congregations 
could have more public talks. 


06:20.328 --> 06:22.331
That’s not all. 


06:22.332 --> 06:24.600
There are thousands of elders 


06:24.600 --> 06:26.868
who are serving 
in isolated congregations 


06:26.868 --> 06:29.705
that may be 100 miles or more 
from the next congregation. 


06:29.705 --> 06:32.142
So in one congregation 
you have one elder, 


06:32.142 --> 06:36.045
and then 100 miles away you have 
another congregation with one elder. 


06:36.045 --> 06:39.415
How many public talks 
were those brothers getting 


06:39.415 --> 06:41.983
when there were 
45-minute public talks? 


06:41.983 --> 06:45.688
The 15-minute reduction 
made a difference.


06:45.688 --> 06:47.690
So if we take a narrow view 


06:47.690 --> 06:51.160
and think only about our own situation 
and our own congregation, 


06:51.160 --> 06:54.297
well, we can have difficulty 
in understanding 


06:54.297 --> 06:57.032
why certain decisions are made. 


06:57.032 --> 07:01.437
Now the same principles 
apply to clarifications in our beliefs. 


07:01.437 --> 07:05.575
The Governing Body loves 
to get together and discuss the Bible. 


07:05.575 --> 07:07.677
And when those Bibles 
come out on the table 


07:07.677 --> 07:09.979
and when the brothers 
bring their research in 


07:09.978 --> 07:13.081
and they’re starting to search 
the Scriptures and analyze the Scriptures, 


07:13.082 --> 07:15.250
you see the happy smiles 
on their faces. 


07:15.250 --> 07:19.488
The brothers love 
discussing spiritual things. 


07:19.488 --> 07:23.091
But the clarifications 


07:23.092 --> 07:26.729
are often a long time 
in coming into print. 


07:26.728 --> 07:28.230
Why? 


07:28.230 --> 07:30.600
Because the clarification 
on one scripture 


07:30.600 --> 07:32.868
can have 
a domino effect on others. 


07:32.868 --> 07:35.136
The clarification 
on one scripture 


07:35.137 --> 07:37.707
can have ramifications 
on other prophecies, 


07:37.707 --> 07:42.110
so we have to be absolutely sure 
that everything fits. 


07:42.110 --> 07:44.113
So to reiterate, 


07:44.113 --> 07:48.116
although certain changes 
may be announced one after another, 


07:48.117 --> 07:52.355
these decisions 
are thought out very carefully.


07:52.355 --> 07:54.557
And here’s 
an interesting side point: 


07:54.557 --> 07:57.025
The older members 
of the Governing Body


07:57.025 --> 07:59.362
—Brother Jaracz, Brother Barr—


07:59.362 --> 08:02.732
were just as interested 
in making the adjustments 


08:02.732 --> 08:05.134
as the younger members were. 


08:05.133 --> 08:18.965
They were very progressive.

00:01.017 --> 00:05.555
This text was taken 
from The Watchtower with the theme: 


00:05.555 --> 00:09.958
“Serving Jehovah 
Before the Days of Distress Come.” 


00:09.958 --> 00:13.295
And the scripture 
was Ecclesiastes 12:1: 


00:13.295 --> 00:15.698
“Remember . . . 
your Grand Creator.” 


00:15.698 --> 00:19.768
Now for some of us 
present here this morning, we must admit 


00:19.768 --> 00:23.840
the days of distress 
have arrived. 


00:23.840 --> 00:28.243
Let’s open our Bibles 
and look at something in the 90th Psalm.


00:28.243 --> 00:33.048
Psalm 90:10 says: 
“The span of our life is 70 years, 


00:33.048 --> 00:36.786
“or 80 if one 
is especially strong. 


00:36.787 --> 00:40.724
“But they are filled 
with trouble and sorrow; 


00:40.723 --> 00:43.125
“they quickly pass by, 


00:43.125 --> 00:46.730
and away we fly.” 


00:46.730 --> 00:51.133
It makes us think 
of the words of Barzillai. 


00:51.133 --> 00:54.603
He made a comment 
at 2 Samuel 19: 


00:54.603 --> 00:58.875
“How many days of my life are left that I 
should go up with the king to Jerusalem?


00:58.875 --> 01:01.477
“I am 80 years old today. 


01:01.477 --> 01:03.747
“Can I discern 
between good and bad? 


01:03.747 --> 01:06.884
“Can I, your servant, 
taste what I eat and drink? 


01:06.883 --> 01:10.753
Can I still listen to the voice 
of male and female singers?” 


01:10.753 --> 01:15.491
Now I can tell you from experience, 
when you reach the age of 80, 


01:15.492 --> 01:18.294
birds may be singing 
when you wake up in the morning, 


01:18.293 --> 01:20.563
but many of us 
can’t hear them.


01:20.563 --> 01:23.165
We’re just too old.


01:23.165 --> 01:27.237
However, it goes without saying, 
wisdom accompanies age. 


01:27.237 --> 01:30.307
So this puts 
a little light, good light, 


01:30.307 --> 01:33.577
on those of us 
who are 80 and beyond. 


01:33.577 --> 01:36.645
In fact the Bible says: 
“Gray hair is a crown of beauty 


01:36.645 --> 01:39.048
when it is found 
in the way of righteousness.” 


01:39.048 --> 01:41.750
Now there are many scriptures 


01:41.750 --> 01:44.420
in the Hebrew Scriptures especially 


01:44.420 --> 01:47.757
that shed light 
on older people 


01:47.757 --> 01:49.825
in a very favorable way. 


01:49.825 --> 01:52.528
One said: “Before gray hair 
you should rise up, 


01:52.528 --> 01:55.331
“and you must show honor 
to an older man 


01:55.332 --> 01:58.134
“[and, of course, 
we can include woman], 


01:58.133 --> 02:00.870
“and you must be 
in fear of your God. 


02:00.870 --> 02:02.938
I am Jehovah.” 


02:02.938 --> 02:06.008
Jehovah does not leave us 
when we get old; 


02:06.008 --> 02:08.945
neither does he forget 
what we did 


02:08.945 --> 02:12.148
when we were young 
and healthy.


02:12.148 --> 02:14.616
It made me think 
of a situation 


02:14.617 --> 02:17.620
that happened in my life 
when I was a young boy. 


02:17.620 --> 02:22.558
My father told me 
to take our two mules, Jim and Old Jack, 


02:22.558 --> 02:26.628
to the creek 
so they could drink some water. 


02:26.628 --> 02:31.633
Later, my father asked me 
if I watered the mules. 


02:31.633 --> 02:35.971
I told him: “Yes, I took Jim 
down there and gave him some water. 


02:35.972 --> 02:37.707
“I didn’t bother Old Jack. 


02:37.707 --> 02:41.644
Old Jack hadn’t done anything 
all day long, just stayed in the barn.” 


02:41.643 --> 02:46.081
My father said: “I want you 
to go back and get Old Jack 


02:46.082 --> 02:50.520
“and take him down and let him 
drink some water, just like you did Jim. 


02:50.520 --> 02:53.455
“Old Jack has spent 
his whole life 


02:53.455 --> 02:55.725
“so that we 
could have bread on the table. 


02:55.725 --> 02:58.662
We’re not going to throw him away 
now that he has grown old.” 


02:58.662 --> 03:02.699
Well that stuck with me, 
and it made me think, too, 


03:02.698 --> 03:06.535
of what the Bible says 
in Hebrews 6:10: 


03:06.535 --> 03:10.072
“For God is not unrighteous 
so as to forget your work 


03:10.072 --> 03:12.342
“and the love 
you showed for his name 


03:12.342 --> 03:16.579
by ministering and continuing to minister 
to the holy ones.” 


03:16.578 --> 03:21.116
So Jehovah wants us to continue, 
even when we’re older, 


03:21.117 --> 03:24.520
to perform our ministry, 
perhaps to slow down a little 


03:24.520 --> 03:27.057
but not to stop.


03:27.057 --> 03:30.594
So share the good news 
you know about Jehovah 


03:30.593 --> 03:32.661
with the next generation. 


03:32.662 --> 03:36.465
That’s what Psalm 78 
encourages us to do. 


03:36.465 --> 03:40.337
It says, “relate 
to the generation to come.” 


03:40.337 --> 03:42.405
Make these things known 


03:42.405 --> 03:45.742
to their children, 
the next generation. 


03:45.742 --> 03:49.379
So we have the responsibility, 
those of us who are older, 


03:49.378 --> 03:52.381
80 and beyond 
or 60 and beyond, 


03:52.382 --> 03:56.785
50 and beyond, 
you just figure out what’s old. 


03:56.785 --> 04:00.857
But now where 
and when can you do that? 


04:00.857 --> 04:03.259
How can you encourage 
the younger ones? 


04:03.258 --> 04:08.130
I don’t know how you can do that, 
where and when. 


04:08.130 --> 04:10.132
I don’t know 
your circumstances, 


04:10.132 --> 04:14.137
but I’m going to give you 
some situations: your room. 


04:14.137 --> 04:16.805
A member of the Governing Body 
invited my wife and I 


04:16.805 --> 04:19.975
when we were serving 
in the district here to come to his room 


04:19.975 --> 04:22.445
and sit in on his 
family Bible study. 


04:22.445 --> 04:25.382
Well, we thought, 
‘That is quite an honor, my land, 


04:25.382 --> 04:28.985
to be able to come to a member 
of the Governing Body’s room and his wife.’ 


04:28.985 --> 04:32.988
And so we went in, and we studied 
for the school and the service meeting. 


04:32.988 --> 04:37.860
On the way home, my wife said, 
“You know, he studies just like we do.” 


04:37.860 --> 04:41.597
Well, that’s the way 
we all should study.


04:41.597 --> 04:43.867
What about field service? 


04:43.867 --> 04:46.469
Between doors, 
stop and smell the roses 


04:46.468 --> 04:48.738
with the younger ones 
that you are working with. 


04:48.738 --> 04:50.740
Breakfast meals, 


04:50.740 --> 04:53.275
squeeze out a “Good morning”
and a warm smile. 


04:53.275 --> 04:56.745
It may be the best you can do 
that early in the morning. 


04:56.745 --> 05:01.750
During the noon meal, mention how Jehovah 
has helped you years ago. 


05:01.750 --> 05:05.488
What about to and from meetings 
in the automobile? 


05:05.488 --> 05:08.825
Share a comment heard 
that made your day. 


05:08.825 --> 05:12.362
During intermission 
at circuit and regional conventions? 


05:12.362 --> 05:15.432
Oh, well, you’re saying, 
‘I’m too tired for that.’ 


05:15.432 --> 05:18.835
Then just sit there 
and look happy. 


05:18.835 --> 05:21.437
When in the infirmary, 


05:21.437 --> 05:25.509
nurses like to break the spell of pain 
and sickness with a little humor. 


05:25.508 --> 05:28.243
Show them your picture 
that was taken 


05:28.243 --> 05:30.913
on your wedding day 
60 years ago. 


05:30.913 --> 05:35.000
They will not believe it’s you 
and will talk about it when you leave. 


05:37.520 --> 05:42.000
Older ones, don’t concentrate 
on what you no longer are able to do. 


05:43.458 --> 05:45.495
Give what you’re able to give, 


05:45.495 --> 05:49.965
give it joyfully, share what you still have 
with the next generation. 


05:49.965 --> 05:53.635
It will encourage them 
and definitely please Jehovah.


05:53.635 --> 05:55.772
Now, what about 
you younger ones? 


05:55.772 --> 05:58.307
Well, the Bible tells you 
to ‘remember your Creator 


05:58.307 --> 06:02.379
‘in the days of your young manhood 
[or your young womanhood] 


06:02.378 --> 06:06.848
before the calamitous days 
or the days of distress arrive.’ 


06:06.848 --> 06:10.386
And they’re going to come, and they’re going 
to hit you like a ton of bricks,


06:10.387 --> 06:14.524
and there’s nothing 
that you will be able to do 


06:14.523 --> 06:16.991
to prevent 
that from happening. 


06:16.992 --> 06:21.197
It’s just part of being 
in this wicked world 


06:21.197 --> 06:24.134
and being filled with sin. 


06:24.133 --> 06:28.470
So Jehovah knows, 
though, what we have to give, 


06:28.470 --> 06:32.208
and he doesn’t expect us 
to give any more than we have. 


06:32.208 --> 06:33.910
So do your best. 


06:33.910 --> 06:36.312
Continue working hard 
in Kingdom service. 


06:36.312 --> 06:41.050
Give your youth 
and vitality to Jehovah. 


06:41.050 --> 06:45.053
You’ll never regret it, 
and Jehovah definitely will not forget 


06:45.053 --> 06:47.323
the love you showed 
for his name. 


06:47.323 --> 06:50.926
He will see to it 
that you “have the full assurance 


06:50.927 --> 07:05.092
of the hope 
down to the end.”

00:01 Well, let’s look at Jude 9 in context.
00:04 Open to the book of Jude.
00:07 We’ll read verse 1, first of all.
00:14 It says:  “Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ,
00:18 “but a brother of James,  to the called ones
00:22 who are loved by God the Father  and preserved for Jesus Christ.”
00:26 What a beautiful,  humble introduction by Jude.
00:30 Didn’t you like that expression,
00:32 “loved by God the Father  and preserved for Jesus Christ”?
00:35 Beautiful.
00:37 But why do we say  that it was a humble introduction?
00:41 Well, you notice he said,  ‘slave of Jesus
00:45 and brother of James.’
00:47 Well, who was James?
00:49 Well, he was  the half brother of Jesus.
00:51 So that means that Jude  also was a half brother of Jesus,
00:55 but he never alluded to that  in his introduction.
00:57 He simply said, ‘a slave of Christ.’
01:01 Now, the Bible doesn’t say,
01:03 but very likely  both James and Jude
01:07 felt a measure of regret
01:09 that they had not become  a disciple of Jesus
01:12 while he was on earth.
01:14 So much so to the point that Jesus,  when he was dying,
01:16 he left their mother’s care
01:18 in their cousin John’s hands
01:21 rather than to either one of them.
01:24 But once they came  to their senses spiritually,
01:27 they were wholly devoted
01:29 for the teachings of Jesus  and his Father.
01:31 And Jude, the book of Jude,
01:33 is an example that a short letter  can be powerful.
01:36 Now if you look in verse 3,
01:39 Jude had intended
01:42 to write about the salvation  that all Christians hold in common.
01:46 But because of circumstances  in the congregation at the time,
01:50 he changed his mind  or Jehovah changed it for him.
01:53 And so now the book of Jude  becomes a local needs part.
01:57 And what was the need  in the congregations at the time?
02:01 Well, glance down  through some of the verses.
02:03 In verse 4,
02:05 ‘certain men have slipped  into the congregation.’
02:07 He says they are  ‘ungodly, with brazen conduct.’
02:10 [Verses] 12 and 13:  ‘rocks below the water,’
02:13 “waterless clouds,”  ‘fruitless trees having died twice,’
02:16 ‘waves casting up the foam of shame,’
02:19 “stars with no set course.”
02:21 Look at 16:  ‘These men are murmurers, complainers,
02:26 ‘following their own desires,  making grandiose boasts
02:29 while they are flattering others  for their own benefit.’
02:35 So he’s really describing the traits  of apostates today, isn’t he?
02:39 But what is verse 9 all about?  Can we read it again in its entirety?
02:44 It says: ‘When Michael the archangel  had a difference with the Devil
02:47 ‘and was disputing about Moses’ body,
02:49 ‘he did not dare to bring judgment  against him in abusive terms,
02:53 but said:  “May Jehovah rebuke you.”’
02:56 Well, Michael’s name
02:59 is the name of Jesus  when he was in heaven,
03:01 both before and after his sojourn  to the earth.
03:04 Well, when did this dispute  with the Devil over Moses’ body occur?
03:09 Well, it certainly wasn’t when Jude  was writing this in 65 [C.E.].
03:12 He’s just using this  as an example from the past
03:16 of one who did not assume authority  that did not belong to him.
03:20 Find Deuteronomy 34:6 with me.
03:27 Now evidently,  the Devil wanted Moses’ body
03:32 to ensnare the Israelites  into some kind of relic worship
03:36 and so he wanted Moses’ body.
03:38 Verse 6 of Deuteronomy 34,
03:41 it says of Moses being buried,  it says:
03:43 “He buried him  in the valley in the land of Moab,
03:46 “opposite Beth-peor,
03:48 and nobody knows  where his grave is down to this day.”
03:52 The February 15, 2015,  Watchtower explained
03:56 that Michael had no qualms
03:58 about arguing this case legally
04:01 with Satan,  because really that’s what it was,
04:03 it was a matter of Satan  didn’t have the right to Moses’ body.
04:07 So like a skillful trial lawyer,
04:10 Michael disputed,  it says with him in the Bible, disputed,
04:14 or we could say,  argued the case.
04:16 But then when it came time  for a decision about what to do with Satan,
04:20 he left that for the Supreme Judge.
04:22 So Jude was giving a lesson  to those in the congregations
04:25 that he said were ‘despising authority,
04:28 speaking abusively of glorious ones.’
04:30 It was a lesson for them.
04:31 Michael set a good example  of not overstepping authority.
04:36 And that becomes  an equally good lesson for us today
04:40 to know the limits  of our authority and responsibility.
04:43 And unlike those rebellious ones  in Jude’s day,
04:47 we don’t want to be rebellious.
04:51 Instead, we want to follow  the lead of the faithful slave
04:55 —be content to do that—
04:57 the slave that Michael,  our Lord Christ Jesus,
05:01 is using today.
05:03 Well,  in deferring to Jehovah’s decision,
05:05 was Jesus in any way  showing weakness?
05:08 No, it was  just respect for authority.
05:10 How do we know?
05:12 Well, after the birth  of the Messianic Kingdom,
05:14 there was no waiting for Jehovah  in that case
05:18 to bring Satan to terms,  rebuke him,
05:23 because Jehovah  had authorized Jesus, Michael,
05:27 had authorized him to war  with the Devil and his demons,
05:30 to throw them out of the heavens,  and Jesus did so with gusto.
05:34 Well, here’s a question:
05:36 Are apostates today as reprehensible
05:39 as those ones that Jude  mentioned in his short letter?
05:43 Are they devious?
05:45 Or maybe they’re sincerely trying
05:48 to help poor, misguided Witnesses.
05:51 No.  They’re devious.
05:54 Have you ever noticed that apostates
05:57 generally do not try  to reason from the Scriptures?
05:59 Why not?
06:01 Because they know  we know the Scriptures,
06:03 and we would see  through the twisting.
06:06 Instead, they picket the organization,  they twist truth,
06:10 they use lies, half-truths,  to try to grab a mind.
06:14 Well, are they deceitful?
06:18 Absolutely. Here’s an example.
06:20 I worked in Writing Correspondence  many years ago,
06:22 and they get letters from everyone  that has our address.
06:26 And sometimes  those letters
06:29 are from ones who have been fed  apostate information.
06:32 And one example I came through  in my stack of letters,
06:35 was from a sincere older lady.
06:38 It seemed by the look of the scrawl  of her handwriting,
06:40 it was probably an older woman,
06:43 and she sent in a photocopy
06:45 from a page  of a 1910 Watchtower.
06:48 And her question is:
06:51 “Why did your Mr. Russell say  that you only need to read his books,
06:55 Studies in the Scriptures,  instead of the Bible?”
06:59 Well, I read over the photocopy
07:01 and it looks like  that’s exactly what it said.
07:03 But then I got an original  of the 1910 magazine and compared,
07:07 and very quickly  you could discern the deceit,
07:10 the trickery, that was involved.
07:12 When photocopying that page,
07:14 they put a piece of white paper  over the bottom part of the page
07:18 so that you didn’t see  the bottom of the first column.
07:21 And they were very tricky;
07:23 they placed it exactly on a line,
07:27 where it sounded like  when reading down the first column,
07:29 that the sentence completed  on the second column.
07:33 But what was in the first part  of that column
07:36 that they had made invisible  with the paper?
07:39 It was a subheading,
07:41 “‘Scripture Studies’  Not a Substitute for the Bible.”
07:45 And here’s what it said in that text
07:47 that disappeared with the photocopying.
07:50 It says: “This is not,  therefore, putting Scripture Studies
07:54 “as a substitute for the Bible,
07:56 “because so far as substituting  for the Bible,
07:58 “the Studies, on the contrary,  continually refer to the Bible;
08:02 “and if anyone has any doubt  as to a reference
08:05 “or if one’s recollection  should lapse in any degree,
08:08 “one should refresh his memory,
08:10 “and, in fact, should see  that his every thought
08:13 “is in harmony with the Bible
08:15 “—not merely in accord  with Scripture Studies,
08:17 but in accord with the Bible.”
08:20 Now, why would someone do that?
08:23 They doctored the page  because of deceit and trickery.
08:27 There was no sincere effort  to help that dear old lady
08:30 who received the copy.
08:32 Well, the book of Jude is applicable  for our view of those today
08:36 who are like evil rocks  hidden below the water.
08:41 But let’s end our discussion
08:43 with a flourish  of positive reinforcement
08:46 from the pen of Jude.
08:48 In Jude,
08:50 verses 24 and 25,
08:55 it says: “Now to the one who is able  to guard you from stumbling
09:00 “and to make you stand unblemished  in the sight of his glory with great joy,
09:04 “to the only God our Savior  through Jesus Christ our Lord,
09:09 “be glory, majesty, might,
09:12 “and authority for all past eternity
09:15 “and now and into all eternity.
09:19 Amen.”

00:01.017 --> 00:04.887
Well, let’s look at Jude 9 in context. 


00:04.887 --> 00:07.524
Open to the book of Jude. 


00:07.523 --> 00:11.000
We’ll read verse 1, first of all. 


00:14.363 --> 00:18.868
It says: 
“Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, 


00:18.868 --> 00:22.038
“but a brother of James, 
to the called ones 


00:22.038 --> 00:26.341
who are loved by God the Father 
and preserved for Jesus Christ.” 


00:26.342 --> 00:30.080
What a beautiful, 
humble introduction by Jude. 


00:30.080 --> 00:32.082
Didn’t you like that expression, 


00:32.082 --> 00:35.652
“loved by God the Father 
and preserved for Jesus Christ”? 


00:35.652 --> 00:37.654
Beautiful. 


00:37.653 --> 00:41.858
But why do we say 
that it was a humble introduction? 


00:41.858 --> 00:45.328
Well, you notice he said, 
‘slave of Jesus 


00:45.328 --> 00:47.330
and brother of James.’ 


00:47.330 --> 00:49.398
Well, who was James? 


00:49.398 --> 00:51.666
Well, he was 
the half brother of Jesus. 


00:51.667 --> 00:55.439
So that means that Jude 
also was a half brother of Jesus, 


00:55.438 --> 00:57.906
but he never alluded to that 
in his introduction. 


00:57.907 --> 01:01.310
He simply said, ‘a slave of Christ.’


01:01.310 --> 01:03.413
Now, the Bible doesn’t say, 


01:03.413 --> 01:07.450
but very likely 
both James and Jude 


01:07.450 --> 01:09.485
felt a measure of regret 


01:09.485 --> 01:12.055
that they had not become 
a disciple of Jesus 


01:12.055 --> 01:14.057
while he was on earth. 


01:14.057 --> 01:16.725
So much so to the point that Jesus, 
when he was dying, 


01:16.725 --> 01:18.862
he left their mother’s care 


01:18.862 --> 01:21.430
in their cousin John’s hands 


01:21.430 --> 01:24.133
rather than to either one of them. 


01:24.133 --> 01:27.236
But once they came 
to their senses spiritually, 


01:27.237 --> 01:29.239
they were wholly devoted 


01:29.238 --> 01:31.473
for the teachings of Jesus 
and his Father. 


01:31.473 --> 01:33.476
And Jude, the book of Jude, 


01:33.477 --> 01:36.145
is an example that a short letter 
can be powerful.


01:36.145 --> 01:39.048
Now if you look in verse 3, 


01:39.048 --> 01:42.118
Jude had intended 


01:42.118 --> 01:46.388
to write about the salvation 
that all Christians hold in common. 


01:46.388 --> 01:50.058
But because of circumstances 
in the congregation at the time, 


01:50.058 --> 01:53.963
he changed his mind 
or Jehovah changed it for him. 


01:53.963 --> 01:57.966
And so now the book of Jude 
becomes a local needs part. 


01:57.967 --> 02:01.170
And what was the need 
in the congregations at the time? 


02:01.170 --> 02:03.172
Well, glance down 
through some of the verses. 


02:03.172 --> 02:05.175
In verse 4, 


02:05.175 --> 02:07.677
‘certain men have slipped 
into the congregation.’ 


02:07.677 --> 02:10.980
He says they are 
‘ungodly, with brazen conduct.’ 


02:10.980 --> 02:13.517
[Verses] 12 and 13: 
‘rocks below the water,’ 


02:13.517 --> 02:16.887
“waterless clouds,” 
‘fruitless trees having died twice,’ 


02:16.887 --> 02:19.589
‘waves casting up the foam of shame,’ 


02:19.588 --> 02:21.925
“stars with no set course.” 


02:21.925 --> 02:26.028
Look at 16: 
‘These men are murmurers, complainers, 


02:26.028 --> 02:29.665
‘following their own desires, 
making grandiose boasts 


02:29.665 --> 02:33.000
while they are flattering others 
for their own benefit.’ 


02:35.405 --> 02:39.475
So he’s really describing the traits 
of apostates today, isn’t he?


02:39.475 --> 02:44.113
But what is verse 9 all about? 
Can we read it again in its entirety? 


02:44.113 --> 02:47.383
It says: ‘When Michael the archangel 
had a difference with the Devil 


02:47.383 --> 02:49.651
‘and was disputing about Moses’ body, 


02:49.652 --> 02:53.055
‘he did not dare to bring judgment 
against him in abusive terms, 


02:53.055 --> 02:56.258
but said: 
“May Jehovah rebuke you.”’ 


02:56.258 --> 02:59.561
Well, Michael’s name 


02:59.562 --> 03:01.564
is the name of Jesus 
when he was in heaven, 


03:01.563 --> 03:04.800
both before and after his sojourn 
to the earth. 


03:04.800 --> 03:09.472
Well, when did this dispute 
with the Devil over Moses’ body occur? 


03:09.472 --> 03:12.675
Well, it certainly wasn’t when Jude 
was writing this in 65 [C.E.]. 


03:12.675 --> 03:16.012
He’s just using this 
as an example from the past 


03:16.012 --> 03:20.250
of one who did not assume authority 
that did not belong to him.


03:20.250 --> 03:24.000
Find Deuteronomy 34:6 with me. 


03:27.223 --> 03:32.095
Now evidently, 
the Devil wanted Moses’ body 


03:32.095 --> 03:36.365
to ensnare the Israelites 
into some kind of relic worship 


03:36.365 --> 03:38.433
and so he wanted Moses’ body. 


03:38.433 --> 03:41.103
Verse 6 of Deuteronomy 34, 


03:41.103 --> 03:43.873
it says of Moses being buried, 
it says: 


03:43.873 --> 03:46.641
“He buried him 
in the valley in the land of Moab, 


03:46.642 --> 03:48.712
“opposite Beth-peor, 


03:48.712 --> 03:52.815
and nobody knows 
where his grave is down to this day.”


03:52.815 --> 03:56.018
The February 15, 2015, 
Watchtower explained 


03:56.018 --> 03:58.253
that Michael had no qualms 


03:58.253 --> 04:01.090
about arguing this case legally 


04:01.090 --> 04:03.660
with Satan, 
because really that’s what it was, 


04:03.660 --> 04:07.563
it was a matter of Satan 
didn’t have the right to Moses’ body. 


04:07.563 --> 04:10.966
So like a skillful trial lawyer, 


04:10.967 --> 04:14.204
Michael disputed, 
it says with him in the Bible, disputed, 


04:14.203 --> 04:16.505
or we could say, 
argued the case. 


04:16.505 --> 04:20.242
But then when it came time 
for a decision about what to do with Satan, 


04:20.242 --> 04:22.812
he left that for the Supreme Judge. 


04:22.812 --> 04:25.415
So Jude was giving a lesson 
to those in the congregations 


04:25.415 --> 04:28.283
that he said were ‘despising authority, 


04:28.283 --> 04:30.386
speaking abusively of glorious ones.’ 


04:30.387 --> 04:31.854
It was a lesson for them. 


04:31.853 --> 04:36.525
Michael set a good example 
of not overstepping authority. 


04:36.525 --> 04:40.397
And that becomes 
an equally good lesson for us today 


04:40.397 --> 04:43.967
to know the limits 
of our authority and responsibility. 


04:43.967 --> 04:47.037
And unlike those rebellious ones 
in Jude’s day, 


04:47.037 --> 04:51.907
we don’t want to be rebellious. 


04:51.907 --> 04:55.445
Instead, we want to follow 
the lead of the faithful slave


04:55.445 --> 04:57.547
—be content to do that—


04:57.547 --> 05:01.184
the slave that Michael, 
our Lord Christ Jesus, 


05:01.183 --> 05:03.185
is using today.


05:03.185 --> 05:05.488
Well, 
in deferring to Jehovah’s decision, 


05:05.488 --> 05:08.623
was Jesus in any way 
showing weakness? 


05:08.623 --> 05:10.693
No, it was 
just respect for authority. 


05:10.693 --> 05:12.261
How do we know? 


05:12.262 --> 05:14.830
Well, after the birth 
of the Messianic Kingdom, 


05:14.830 --> 05:18.935
there was no waiting for Jehovah 
in that case 


05:18.935 --> 05:23.338
to bring Satan to terms, 
rebuke him, 


05:23.338 --> 05:27.043
because Jehovah 
had authorized Jesus, Michael, 


05:27.043 --> 05:30.311
had authorized him to war 
with the Devil and his demons, 


05:30.312 --> 05:34.517
to throw them out of the heavens, 
and Jesus did so with gusto.


05:34.517 --> 05:36.519
Well, here’s a question: 


05:36.518 --> 05:39.955
Are apostates today as reprehensible 


05:39.955 --> 05:43.292
as those ones that Jude 
mentioned in his short letter? 


05:43.292 --> 05:45.895
Are they devious? 


05:45.895 --> 05:48.263
Or maybe they’re sincerely trying 


05:48.263 --> 05:51.200
to help poor, misguided Witnesses. 


05:51.200 --> 05:54.203
No. 
They’re devious. 


05:54.203 --> 05:57.240
Have you ever noticed that apostates 


05:57.240 --> 05:59.908
generally do not try 
to reason from the Scriptures? 


05:59.908 --> 06:01.910
Why not? 


06:01.910 --> 06:03.913
Because they know 
we know the Scriptures, 


06:03.913 --> 06:06.048
and we would see 
through the twisting. 


06:06.048 --> 06:10.386
Instead, they picket the organization, 
they twist truth, 


06:10.387 --> 06:14.890
they use lies, half-truths, 
to try to grab a mind. 


06:14.890 --> 06:18.127
Well, are they deceitful? 


06:18.127 --> 06:20.129
Absolutely.
Here’s an example. 


06:20.128 --> 06:22.698
I worked in Writing Correspondence 
many years ago,


06:22.698 --> 06:26.868
and they get letters from everyone 
that has our address. 


06:26.868 --> 06:29.105
And sometimes 
those letters 


06:29.105 --> 06:32.642
are from ones who have been fed 
apostate information. 


06:32.642 --> 06:35.945
And one example I came through 
in my stack of letters, 


06:35.945 --> 06:38.247
was from a sincere older lady. 


06:38.247 --> 06:40.950
It seemed by the look of the scrawl 
of her handwriting, 


06:40.950 --> 06:43.252
it was probably an older woman, 


06:43.252 --> 06:45.254
and she sent in a photocopy 


06:45.253 --> 06:48.690
from a page 
of a 1910 Watchtower. 


06:48.690 --> 06:51.527
And her question is: 


06:51.527 --> 06:55.197
“Why did your Mr. Russell say 
that you only need to read his books, 


06:55.197 --> 06:59.002
Studies in the Scriptures, 
instead of the Bible?” 


06:59.002 --> 07:01.070
Well, I read over the photocopy 


07:01.070 --> 07:03.705
and it looks like 
that’s exactly what it said. 


07:03.705 --> 07:07.443
But then I got an original 
of the 1910 magazine and compared, 


07:07.443 --> 07:10.780
and very quickly 
you could discern the deceit, 


07:10.780 --> 07:12.848
the trickery, that was involved. 


07:12.848 --> 07:14.850
When photocopying that page, 


07:14.850 --> 07:18.287
they put a piece of white paper 
over the bottom part of the page 


07:18.287 --> 07:21.990
so that you didn’t see 
the bottom of the first column. 


07:21.990 --> 07:23.993
And they were very tricky; 


07:23.993 --> 07:27.163
they placed it exactly on a line, 


07:27.163 --> 07:29.898
where it sounded like 
when reading down the first column, 


07:29.898 --> 07:33.535
that the sentence completed 
on the second column. 


07:33.535 --> 07:36.372
But what was in the first part 
of that column 


07:36.372 --> 07:39.875
that they had made invisible 
with the paper? 


07:39.875 --> 07:41.877
It was a subheading, 


07:41.877 --> 07:45.582
“‘Scripture Studies’ 
Not a Substitute for the Bible.” 


07:45.582 --> 07:47.584
And here’s what it said in that text 


07:47.583 --> 07:50.385
that disappeared with the photocopying. 


07:50.385 --> 07:54.090
It says: “This is not, 
therefore, putting Scripture Studies 


07:54.090 --> 07:56.092
“as a substitute for the Bible, 


07:56.092 --> 07:58.394
“because so far as substituting 
for the Bible, 


07:58.393 --> 08:02.130
“the Studies, on the contrary, 
continually refer to the Bible; 


08:02.130 --> 08:05.367
“and if anyone has any doubt 
as to a reference 


08:05.367 --> 08:08.570
“or if one’s recollection 
should lapse in any degree, 


08:08.570 --> 08:10.773
“one should refresh his memory, 


08:10.773 --> 08:13.041
“and, in fact, should see 
that his every thought 


08:13.042 --> 08:15.512
“is in harmony with the Bible


08:15.512 --> 08:17.814
“—not merely in accord 
with Scripture Studies, 


08:17.813 --> 08:20.148
but in accord with the Bible.”


08:20.148 --> 08:23.251
Now, why would someone do that? 


08:23.252 --> 08:27.424
They doctored the page 
because of deceit and trickery. 


08:27.423 --> 08:30.626
There was no sincere effort 
to help that dear old lady 


08:30.627 --> 08:32.695
who received the copy. 


08:32.695 --> 08:36.932
Well, the book of Jude is applicable 
for our view of those today 


08:36.932 --> 08:41.737
who are like evil rocks 
hidden below the water. 


08:41.737 --> 08:43.739
But let’s end our discussion 


08:43.738 --> 08:46.575
with a flourish 
of positive reinforcement 


08:46.575 --> 08:48.912
from the pen of Jude. 


08:48.912 --> 08:50.914
In Jude, 


08:50.913 --> 08:55.785
verses 24 and 25, 


08:55.785 --> 09:00.155
it says: “Now to the one who is able 
to guard you from stumbling 


09:00.155 --> 09:04.593
“and to make you stand unblemished 
in the sight of his glory with great joy, 


09:04.593 --> 09:09.398
“to the only God our Savior 
through Jesus Christ our Lord, 


09:09.398 --> 09:12.535
“be glory, majesty, might, 


09:12.535 --> 09:15.838
“and authority for all past eternity 


09:15.838 --> 09:19.075
“and now and into all eternity. 


09:19.075 --> 09:32.838
Amen.”

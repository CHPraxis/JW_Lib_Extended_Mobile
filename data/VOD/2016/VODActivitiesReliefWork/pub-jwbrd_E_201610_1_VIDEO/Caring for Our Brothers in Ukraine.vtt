00:00.883 --> 00:04.486
We begin with a report from Ukraine. 


00:04.487 --> 00:08.559
In 2014, 
political tensions in eastern Ukraine 


00:08.558 --> 00:12.495
boiled over 
into a full-blown military conflict. 


00:12.495 --> 00:14.497
Within months, 


00:14.497 --> 00:17.400
over 7,600 Witnesses 


00:17.400 --> 00:20.137
needed to flee the area 
to seek refuge. 


00:20.137 --> 00:22.872
Others sheltered in their homes. 


00:22.872 --> 00:25.275
How did our brothers 
survive physically 


00:25.275 --> 00:27.643
and spiritually 
through the fighting? 


00:27.643 --> 00:30.913
Relief was organized 
from hundreds of miles away 


00:30.913 --> 00:33.450
at the branch office in L’viv. 


00:33.450 --> 00:35.752
In the following interviews, 


00:35.752 --> 00:39.122
our brothers and sisters 
describe the love and care 


00:39.122 --> 00:43.000
they received from the organization 
and from each other.


00:58.708 --> 01:00.976
It happened that the hostilities 


01:00.977 --> 01:03.112
started without warning, 


01:03.112 --> 01:06.000
and the brothers needed to flee quickly.


01:08.383 --> 01:10.386
There was not enough food; 


01:10.387 --> 01:12.522
there was nothing in the stores; 


01:12.522 --> 01:14.524
there was a lack of medicine; 


01:14.523 --> 01:16.525
there was no water, 


01:16.525 --> 01:19.095
no electricity.


01:19.095 --> 01:20.930
It was scary. 


01:20.930 --> 01:22.765
There was no stability at all. 


01:22.765 --> 01:25.835
We did not know what to do.


01:25.835 --> 01:28.000
Should we stay, or should we leave?


01:30.940 --> 01:34.410
There were triplets; 
they were seven years old. 


01:34.410 --> 01:36.545
As soon as they 
got into the shelter, 


01:36.545 --> 01:39.000
they started singing 
a Kingdom song. 


01:42.185 --> 01:44.453
The adults 
also joined them in singing, 


01:44.453 --> 01:47.323
and because of that, 
we couldn’t hear the explosions 


01:47.323 --> 01:50.000
that were happening outside.


01:51.260 --> 01:53.797
True, we ran out of foodstuffs, 


01:53.797 --> 01:55.865
and we had no money. 


01:55.865 --> 01:58.868
But I knew we would be able to get by. 


01:58.868 --> 02:01.805
God would not let us die of hunger.


02:01.805 --> 02:06.008
Because the shelling was happening
so often, it was impossible 


02:06.008 --> 02:08.010
to conduct our usual meetings. 


02:08.010 --> 02:12.215
We also couldn’t organize the ministry 
in the normal way. 


02:12.215 --> 02:14.950
It was just too dangerous.


02:14.950 --> 02:18.353
When we received the first reports 
about the unrest in the east, 


02:18.353 --> 02:20.356
our Branch Committee gathered 


02:20.357 --> 02:23.292
and we prayerfully analyzed 
the situation. 


02:23.292 --> 02:26.695
We asked Jehovah for wisdom
—how to act, 


02:26.695 --> 02:30.400
how to help our brothers 
to be spiritually and physically safe. 


02:30.400 --> 02:33.937
We were also sending regular
update reports to the Governing Body.


02:33.937 --> 02:37.074
More than 156 tons of food 


02:37.073 --> 02:40.210
and 21 tons of clothing donated 


02:40.210 --> 02:42.712
by local brothers have been distributed 


02:42.712 --> 02:45.949
to fellow believers 
and also to some non-Witnesses.


02:45.948 --> 02:48.985
We had been told 
that we would be receiving 


02:48.985 --> 02:50.987
about five tons of relief supplies. 


02:50.987 --> 02:54.490
So we were astounded 
when instead of 5 tons, 


02:54.490 --> 02:56.492
we received 15 tons!


02:56.492 --> 02:58.962
It was lovely to find little notes 


02:58.962 --> 03:01.530
that our brothers 
and sisters had written 


03:01.530 --> 03:04.000
and included in the packages.


03:05.268 --> 03:08.103
Brothers from neighboring cities responded 


03:08.103 --> 03:10.273
and offered their homes, 


03:10.273 --> 03:12.275
provided foodstuffs 


03:12.275 --> 03:16.412
and, more importantly, 
their brotherly hospitality.


03:16.412 --> 03:18.915
So we are ready to make sacrifices, 


03:18.915 --> 03:21.117
to adjust our schedules, 


03:21.117 --> 03:23.987
and to even take time 
out from our families 


03:23.987 --> 03:26.000
to render practical help 
to our brothers.


03:28.692 --> 03:31.760
For example,
beginning at 6 a.m., 


03:31.760 --> 03:34.430
I would visit 
the brothers and sisters 


03:34.430 --> 03:37.000
and bring them 
the things that they needed. 


03:39.035 --> 03:42.272
So during two and a half months of war 


03:42.272 --> 03:44.340
and two months of reconstruction, 


03:44.340 --> 03:46.342
I rode my bicycle 


03:46.342 --> 03:49.000
6,500 kilometers.


03:50.947 --> 03:53.750
The local elders from Slavyansk 


03:53.750 --> 03:55.952
organized small congregations 


03:55.952 --> 03:57.954
and regularly conducted meetings 


03:57.953 --> 04:00.000
to support them spiritually.


04:01.123 --> 04:04.126
Major repairs 
have been carried out on 20 houses 


04:04.127 --> 04:06.729
of brothers and sisters, 
and minor repair work 


04:06.728 --> 04:10.633
was done on 72 houses 
and apartments.


04:10.633 --> 04:12.801
We prepared two more programs. 


04:12.802 --> 04:16.405
This time, not only 
for the congregations in the war zone 


04:16.405 --> 04:18.473
but for the whole country of Ukraine, 


04:18.473 --> 04:20.643
even for Russia and Belarus. 


04:20.643 --> 04:25.981
We even had 325,000 
in attendance.


04:25.982 --> 04:27.984
An interesting experience 


04:27.983 --> 04:31.920
was the response of the people 
who were not Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


04:31.920 --> 04:35.525
They belong to another religion, 
yet they said: 


04:35.525 --> 04:38.728
“You are the only ones 
that really care. 


04:38.728 --> 04:42.131
Your genuine love 
is shown by your deeds.” 


04:42.132 --> 04:45.034
This is what makes us different 


04:45.033 --> 04:48.000
from all other religions.


04:49.372 --> 04:51.975
This unselfish love 
shown by our brothers 


04:51.975 --> 04:54.000
did not go unnoticed 
by my husband and my son. 


04:55.978 --> 04:58.046
My husband 
started studying the Bible, 


04:58.047 --> 05:00.784
and he regularly attends 
the meetings now. 


05:00.783 --> 05:04.000
Recently, he enrolled 
in the Theocratic Ministry School.


05:06.755 --> 05:09.558
I experienced this love personally, 


05:09.558 --> 05:13.930
and I started studying 
the Bible again with the brothers. 


05:13.930 --> 05:16.798
Now I am preparing for baptism.


05:16.798 --> 05:20.603
Unfortunately, 
one of our sisters was killed.


05:20.603 --> 05:23.973
I realized that a person can lose


05:23.973 --> 05:27.276
—lose everything, but that 


05:27.277 --> 05:31.180
is really nothing 
compared to losing your children. 


05:31.180 --> 05:34.117
The brothers and sisters listened to us. 


05:34.117 --> 05:36.119
We cried together. 


05:36.118 --> 05:38.888
I just can’t put it into words. 


05:38.888 --> 05:42.091
It is as if Jehovah 
is holding you in his arms


05:42.092 --> 05:44.094
—he doesn’t let you fall—


05:44.093 --> 05:46.095
as if he is saying to you: 


05:46.095 --> 05:48.430
‘Don’t let go, my dear one. 


05:48.430 --> 05:51.000
I’m helping you. 
I’m supporting you.’


05:52.768 --> 05:56.571
With Jehovah there are no borders 
between nations. 


05:56.572 --> 06:01.000
I could see 
that this was the true religion.


06:02.678 --> 06:06.548
We continue to pray 
for our brothers in Ukraine. 


06:06.548 --> 06:09.818
We’re confident 
of Jehovah’s love for them, 


06:09.818 --> 06:25.018
and we know he’ll sustain them 
through any tribulation.

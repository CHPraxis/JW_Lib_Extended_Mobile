Jehovah made Jesus first,

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:11.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the angels.

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was no sun,

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:14.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moon,

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:16.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stars,

00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:18.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no earth.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that be like?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be something like this.

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:25.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t see, Daddy.

00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:29.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created the stars,

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including our sun, . . .

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:32.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:34.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and the earth.

00:00:34.937 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it did not look like it does now.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:40.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning, there was nothing

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:43.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but one big ocean of water

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:44.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until

00:00:48.187 --> 00:00:50.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made land appear.

00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he made grass

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trees.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!
Dad, my bear!

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t worry, my son, I will help you.

00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:14.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go.

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:16.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Dad.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about all the animals?

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, he made sea life

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the birds.

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:32.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daddy, I’m flying!

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:35.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you know what Jehovah made next?

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made all the animals that live on land.

00:01:45.062 --> 00:01:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an elephant!

00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:49.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he made people.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created the earth

00:01:55.562 --> 00:01:57.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everything on it.

00:02:01.312 --> 00:02:03.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made it beautiful

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:05.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can enjoy it.

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:12.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to enjoy his creation forever.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:16.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ready to say a prayer?

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s thank Jehovah.

00:00:09 When eyes of blind ones see again And ears of deaf ones hear again,
00:00:22 When deserts blossom as the rose And from parched ground fresh water flows,
00:00:35 When lame ones leap just like the hart, When loved ones never have to part,
00:00:49 Such blessed times you’ll realize, If you keep your eyes on the prize.
00:01:08 When tongues of mute ones speak again, When old ones will be young again,
00:01:21 When earth will yield her rich increase And all good things will never cease,
00:01:35 When songs of children fill the air, When joy and peace are ev’rywhere,
00:01:48 Then, too, you’ll see the dead arise, If you keep your eyes on the prize.
00:02:06 When wolves and lambs will feed as one, When bears and calves bask in the sun,
00:02:20 A mere young boy will lead them all, And they will heed his childish call.
00:02:33 When tears belong to yesterday, When fears and pain have passed away,
00:02:47 You’ll see how God these things supplies, If you keep your eyes on the prize.

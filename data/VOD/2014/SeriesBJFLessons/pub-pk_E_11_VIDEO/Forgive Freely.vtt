Caleb!
You broke my toy!

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t mean to.
I’m sorry.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always say that!

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I am sorry.

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well that won’t fix my toy.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong, children?

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:23.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He broke my toy!

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:25.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him not to touch it.

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said I was sorry!

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always say you’re sorry!

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:32.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, OK, children.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Caleb broke your toy.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all he did!

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He ate my ice cream,

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:41.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he went into my room without asking,

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:42.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he scribbled on my songbook!

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:47.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I am sorry.

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia, can you think
of anything you have done wrong?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I forgot to make up my bed,

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:59.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my homework,
and I didn’t do the dishes.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s not easy to remember our mistakes,

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:12.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but are you sorry?

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:18.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what Jehovah does
when we are truly sorry?

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:22.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminds us at Ephesians 4:32.

00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:27.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: ‘God freely forgave you.’

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:30.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia, what does it mean to freely forgive?

00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:52.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am sorry, Sophia!

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s OK, Caleb, I forgive you.

00:01:55.104 --> 00:01:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, good, children.

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:59.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes Jehovah very happy.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does anybody know where the mess came from?

00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:03.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-oh.

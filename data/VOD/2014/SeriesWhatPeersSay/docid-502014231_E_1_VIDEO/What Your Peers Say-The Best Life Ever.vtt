When we’re growing up,

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we all have to make decisions.

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have to choose
which path we will take.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents raised me
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our ministry
—teaching others about the Bible—

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has always been an important part of my life.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a teenager,
I wanted to expand my ministry

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to take it to the next level.

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are friends in my local congregation

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had gone to foreign countries
and helped teach people the Bible.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading experiences from the<i> Yearbook</i>
motivated me

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that was a goal
that I wanted to set for myself.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a few years of careful planning
and saving,

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:01.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was finally able to travel to Malawi.

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people there
had such a high respect for the Bible.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could talk to someone
walking down the street

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or living in a small house,
or even a mansion.

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:16.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all were interested
in what the Bible had to say.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one time in Malawi,
one of the workers invited us in.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the head of the house

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invited all the workers and family members,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came into the living room,
sat down, and he said,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“OK, what would you like to tell us
from the Bible?”

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m just sitting there like,
“Wow! This is incredible.”

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so encouraging

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to share Bible truths.

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:54.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some days you’d be out for 12 hours,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
riding home on the bus,
dust coming in the windows,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing a seat with four people,

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even sometimes a chicken
would be on your lap.

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d get off the bus,
and you’d have to walk two miles home,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re just exhausted,

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you couldn’t help but have
a grin on your face because you felt

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like you accomplished something that day

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you were doing
the best work you could possibly do.

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy leaving home,
learning a new language,

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even a new culture.

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of those experiences,

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:33.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it taught me to rely more on Jehovah.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:39.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when we’re younger,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we kind of get really involved
in whatever environment we’re in.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you step outside of that box
and you experience something

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve never handled before,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps you to grow as a person

00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serve Jehovah in ways
you never thought were possible.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Cameron.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have the best life ever.

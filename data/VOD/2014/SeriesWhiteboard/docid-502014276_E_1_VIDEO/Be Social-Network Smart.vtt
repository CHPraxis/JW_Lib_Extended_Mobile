What can you do on a social network?

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can connect with people;

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(a <i>lot</i>  of people)

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share your photos;

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell jokes;

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:20.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
post your thoughts on,

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, just about anything;

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And see what all your friends are up to.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s pretty easy

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:29.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and <i>that’s</i>  the problem.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s a little <i>too</i>  easy.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, a social network may look harmless,

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but once you log in,

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watch out!

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a dangerous place.

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if your parents
allow you to have an account,

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have to be smart,

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
social-network smart.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Follow the front-page rule.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:55.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t post anything

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you wouldn’t want to see on the TV news

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the front page of the newspaper.

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that includes
personal information like

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your phone number,

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you live,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where you go to school.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never tell people when you’re not home

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when you’re going on vacation.

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may seem harmless,

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s exactly the kind of information

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thieves can use to break into your house

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even steal your identity!

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:31.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at your reputation.

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your photos and comments say a lot about you.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, if you’ve made a fool of yourself, ask,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is this how I really want people to view me

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just now but in the future,

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like at a job interview?’

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 At Proverbs 22:1,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says a good reputation

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is ‘worth more than silver and gold.’

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:56.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let that Delete key fool you.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Posting something on any social network

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is kind of like writing in permanent ink.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you’re careful 
about <i>what</i>  you share.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think
about <i>who </i> you’re sharing it with.

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:13.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are your friends?

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people have hundreds of online friends.

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:18.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have thousands.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you may think,
‘The more friends, the better, right?’

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, no!

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of thinking
can blow up in your face.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:31.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
when you connect with online friends,

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:35.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are also indirectly connecting
with <i>their</i>  friends

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their <i>friends’</i>  friends.

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means
you may find yourself seeing posts

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from people you don’t even know

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people whose morals and beliefs
may be different from yours.

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may use bad language

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:52.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or post about things you <i>know are wrong.</i>

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:55.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those just aren’t the kind of friends
you want to hang around with

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not even online.

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s another danger.

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 26:4,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible warns about people
“who hide what they are.”

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:08.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They pretend to be someone they are not

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may seem super friendly,

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:15.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they can be dangerous.

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to friends,
you need to be picky.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:24.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The safest friends <i>online </i>

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are ones you already know <i>offline.</i>

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s one more thing to think about:

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to do with your <i>time.</i>

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:36.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Checking out the latest posts
can be addictive.

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s set some limits,

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t let your <i>online </i> life

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get in the way of your <i>real</i>  life.

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,
connecting with others online

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be fun and safe

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as you look out for all the dangers.

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:59.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the next time you log in, be smart,

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:02.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
social-network smart.

Whether you’re in school or not,
you’re probably under a lot of pressure.

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:12.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not just from all the studying

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those piles of homework.

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But pressure from other kids.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pressure to have sex.

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:20.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or cheat.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe it’s to smoke or take drugs.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
you know what they want you to do is bad,

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at times you may feel
like you’re missing out

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you don’t join them.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:35.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone.

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:37.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the world began, young people

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been dealing with peer pressure.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it doesn’t mean you have to give in.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible has some good advice.

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 23:2 tells us

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:48.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to just follow after the crowd.

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, don’t do something

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because everyone else is doing it.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, be your own person.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you get the strength
to stand up to peer pressure?

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are four steps that can help.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First,

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep on the lookout for moral dangers,

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and identify any situations

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you might be pressured
to do something wrong.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you see trouble coming your way,
don’t walk right into it!

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find another route, and avoid the problem.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second step:

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop and take the time to think.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the consequences

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you give in to peer pressure.

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Proverbs 14:15, the Bible says:

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Smart people watch their step.’

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t just jump in and do what others say.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may be hard to do

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’re trying to fit in.

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s the time to use your imagination.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will I feel later if I give in?

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:01.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What might be the outcome?

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might my actions affect others

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who care about me the most?

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step three: You need to plan ahead.

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:15.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 24:5 says

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a person who has knowledge
“increases his power.”

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you know exactly 
<i>why</i>  you’re saying no to something,

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why something is bad,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can give you the strength to say no.

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fourth step: Take action.

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you don’t have
to give your peers a lecture.

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just say no, clearly and confidently.

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:44.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be surprised at their reaction.

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time take a stand
for what you know is right,

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you get stronger and stronger.

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:53.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that makes it easier to resist
the pressure the next time.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:56.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t need to be rude,

00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:00.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you could give a reason
why you wouldn’t want to join in.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they do keep pressuring you,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just remember this:
Giving in to peer pressure

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is kind of like being turned into a puppet

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—with your peers pulling the strings.

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t hide from peer pressure,

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you can stand up to it.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember to keep on the lookout.

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the consequences.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Plan ahead.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take action.

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Facing up to peer pressure

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be scary at times.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you do,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you show the decisions you make

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really are your own.

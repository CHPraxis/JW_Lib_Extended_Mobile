00:00:02 An introduction to the book of Numbers.
00:00:06 Numbers was written by Moses.
00:00:09 He began the writing in the wilderness of Sinai
00:00:12 and completed it on the plains of Moab.
00:00:16 The narrative covers a period
00:00:18 of 38 years and 9 months,
00:00:20 from 1512 to 1473 B.C.E.
00:00:24 when Moses finished the writing.
00:00:28 Numbers gets its name
00:00:30 from the two times that Moses numbered the people
00:00:32 —first at Mount Sinai
00:00:34 and later on the plains of Moab.
00:00:38 The book highlights Jehovah’s ability to lead his people,
00:00:43 it underscores the need to obey God’s appointed representatives,
00:00:47 and it illustrates the importance of strong faith.
00:00:52 Numbers has 36 chapters.
00:00:55 In chapters 1 to 4,
00:00:57 Israelite males 20 years old and up,
00:01:00 except for the Levites, are registered for the army.
00:01:05 The Levites are set apart to assist the priests.
00:01:09 Chapters 5 to 9 discuss marital faithfulness,
00:01:13 quarantining, and service as a Nazirite.
00:01:17 In chapter 10, the Israelites pull away
00:01:20 from the wilderness of Sinai by their tribal divisions.
00:01:25 In chapter 11, the people complain about the manna,
00:01:29 a miraculous food provided by Jehovah.
00:01:33 In the next chapter, Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses.
00:01:37 For this, Miriam is temporarily struck with leprosy
00:01:41 and quarantined for seven days.
00:01:45 In chapters 13 and 14,
00:01:47 twelve Israelite chieftains —one from each tribe—
00:01:51 are sent to spy out the land of Canaan.
00:01:54 Ten spies bring back a negative report,
00:01:57 and the people want to return to Egypt.
00:02:00 For this gross lack of faith,
00:02:03 the Israelites must wander in the wilderness
00:02:05 for 40 years until that generation has died.
00:02:10 Did you know?
00:02:12 Joshua and Caleb were the only spies
00:02:15 who had faith in Jehovah.
00:02:18 So they were the only spies who would enter the Promised Land.
00:02:21 And they did!
00:02:24 Caleb inherited the field and settlements of Hebron.
00:02:27 Joshua’s inheritance was in the mountainous region of Ephraim,
00:02:31 where he died at the age of 110.
00:02:37 Chapters 15 to 17 discuss the various offerings for sins
00:02:41 as well as the rebellion and execution of Korah,
00:02:45 Dathan, Abiram, and their supporters.
00:02:50 In chapter 21, the people again complain about the manna,
00:02:54 calling it “contemptible bread.”
00:02:57 In chapters 22 to 24,
00:03:00 Moabite King Balak hires Balaam,
00:03:03 a greedy non-Israelite, to curse Israel.
00:03:07 But Jehovah makes Balaam pronounce blessings.
00:03:11 In chapter 25,
00:03:13 many of God’s people commit sexual immorality with Moabite women.
00:03:19 This leads to idolatry
00:03:21 and the death of 24,000 Israelites by a scourge from God.
00:03:27 In the next chapter, Moses takes the second census.
00:03:32 In chapter 27, the daughters of Zelophehad tell Moses
00:03:36 that they have no brother to carry on the family inheritance.
00:03:41 Jehovah directs that in such situations
00:03:44 a daughter may have that privilege.
00:03:47 Then God commands Moses to ascend a mountain
00:03:51 in the region of Abarim to view the Promised Land.
00:03:54 Because Moses is soon to die,
00:03:57 Jehovah tells him to appoint Joshua
00:04:00 to lead Israel into Canaan.
00:04:03 Chapters 31 to 36 discuss the apportioning of Canaan
00:04:08 and other matters as the Israelites
00:04:10 prepare to cross the Jordan River.
00:04:14 As you read the book of Numbers,
00:04:16 note how Jehovah patiently guides his people,
00:04:20 see why we need to obey those appointed
00:04:23 to take the lead among us,
00:04:25 and reflect on our need for strong faith
00:04:29 as we approach a far greater Promised Land
00:04:32 —the new world under God’s Kingdom.

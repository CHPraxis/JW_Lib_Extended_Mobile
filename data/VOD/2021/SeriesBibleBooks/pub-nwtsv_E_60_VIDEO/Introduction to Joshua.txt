00:00:01 An introduction to the book of Joshua.
00:00:05 The book of Joshua is named after its writer,
00:00:09 Joshua the son of Nun,
00:00:11 who succeeded Moses as leader of Israel.
00:00:15 The book likely covers a period
00:00:18 of more than 20 years,
00:00:20 starting in 1473 B.C.E.
00:00:23 and ending in about 1450 B.C.E.
00:00:26 when the book was completed.
00:00:29 The book of Joshua can be divided into four sections:
00:00:33 Israel’s entry into Canaan,
00:00:35 the conquest of the land,
00:00:37 the apportioning of it to the individual tribes,
00:00:41 and Joshua’s final exhortations.
00:00:45 The book provides valuable lessons
00:00:47 on the need for courage, faith, and obedience
00:00:51 —especially when God’s people face strong enemies.
00:00:57 In chapters 1 and 2,
00:00:59 Jehovah tells Joshua to be courageous and strong,
00:01:03 the Israelites prepare to cross the Jordan River,
00:01:07 and Joshua sends out two spies who go to Jericho.
00:01:13 The spies go to the home of Rahab, a prostitute.
00:01:17 Moved by faith in Jehovah, she hides the spies,
00:01:21 thereby disobeying the order of the king.
00:01:24 In chapters 3 to 6, Israel miraculously crosses
00:01:29 the Jordan River on dry ground,
00:01:31 even though the river is at flood stage.
00:01:35 The Israelites observe the Passover
00:01:38 and begin to eat the produce of the land.
00:01:42 Joshua then meets a man with a drawn sword.
00:01:45 The man is “the prince of Jehovah’s army.”
00:01:49 Through him, Jehovah tells Joshua how to conquer Jericho.
00:01:54 Chapters 6 to 12 describe the conquest of the Promised Land.
00:02:00 In chapter 6, Jericho falls.
00:02:03 Only Rahab and her father’s household are spared.
00:02:08 In chapter 7, Achan is exposed
00:02:11 for disobediently taking spoil from Jericho.
00:02:15 He is put to death along with his family,
00:02:18 who no doubt helped to conceal his sin.
00:02:22 Did you know?
00:02:24 Rahab and Achan provide contrasting lessons
00:02:27 in faith and obedience.
00:02:30 Though a Canaanite, Rahab was saved
00:02:34 because she obeyed the spies
00:02:36 and showed courageous faith in Jehovah.
00:02:39 Although Achan was a member of God’s dedicated nation
00:02:43 and witnessed Jehovah bringing down the walls of Jericho,
00:02:47 he was put to death because of his disobedience,
00:02:51 lack of faith, and greed.
00:02:55 In chapter 8, Ai is conquered
00:02:58 and reduced to “a permanent mound of ruins.”
00:03:02 Joshua then reads God’s Law to the people.
00:03:05 Half of the nation stands in front of Mount Gerizim
00:03:08 and the other half in front of Mount Ebal.
00:03:13 In chapter 9, the Gibeonites trick Joshua
00:03:16 into making a covenant with them
00:03:19 and he spares their lives.
00:03:21 Chapters 10 to 12 contain a record
00:03:24 of some of Israel’s God-given victories.
00:03:28 God even hurls great hailstones at the Amorites
00:03:32 and makes the sun stand still so that Israel
00:03:35 can “take vengeance on its enemies.”
00:03:37 In chapters 13 to 22,
00:03:40 the Promised Land is apportioned among the tribes of Israel,
00:03:45 the tabernacle is set up at Shiloh,
00:03:49 and the Israelites select six cities of refuge
00:03:52 for the unintentional manslayer.
00:03:55 In chapter 22, the tribes of Reuben and Gad
00:03:59 and the half tribe of Manasseh
00:04:01 go to their inheritance east of the Jordan.
00:04:04 Chapters 23 and 24
00:04:07 contain Joshua’s farewell speeches.
00:04:10 He tells the people to “fear Jehovah
00:04:13 and serve him with integrity and faithfulness.”
00:04:18 Joshua as well as Aaron’s son Eleazar then die.
00:04:23 Also, the Israelites fulfill their sworn oath
00:04:27 to bury the bones of Jacob’s son Joseph
00:04:29 in the Promised Land.
00:04:32 As you read the book of Joshua,
00:04:35 note how Jehovah blesses faithful and obedient ones;
00:04:40 see how he fights for his people;
00:04:42 and observe how he fulfills all his promises,
00:04:46 thus strengthening our faith in our future inheritance
00:04:50 under his glorious Kingdom.

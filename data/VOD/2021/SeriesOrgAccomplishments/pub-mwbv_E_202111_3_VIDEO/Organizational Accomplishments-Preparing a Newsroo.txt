00:00:10 We have heard from many of you how much you’ve really appreciated JW News
00:00:15 as a source of accurate information.
00:00:18 In contrast with much of the misinformation
00:00:21 posted on the Internet and social media,
00:00:23 Jehovah’s people serve as “a pillar and support of the truth,”
00:00:27 as 1 Timothy 3:15 says.
00:00:30 But just what does it take to prepare a Newsroom report?
00:00:35 Well, under the direction of the Coordinators’ Committee
00:00:37 of the Governing Body,
00:00:39 the Office of Public Information, or OPI,
00:00:42 prepares articles for the JW Newsroom.
00:00:46 Now, they work closely with Public Information Desks, or PIDs,
00:00:50 in our branch offices.
00:00:53 In the following report, some of these brothers
00:00:55 share a behind-the-scenes look
00:00:58 at how articles in the last few years
00:01:00 have been written and published on JW News.
00:01:08 From the late 1960’s
00:01:11 to the late 1990’s,
00:01:12 Italian brothers were condemned
00:01:14 and imprisoned for refusing military service.
00:01:17 A recent survey revealed that more than 14,000 brothers
00:01:21 from that group are still alive.
00:01:23 They were sentenced to a total of almost 10,000 years in prison.
00:01:28 We thought that their experiences could make
00:01:30 a potential story for the Newsroom section of jw.org,
00:01:34 along with comments from secular sources,
00:01:37 so we promptly notified OPI.
00:01:41 When we received that proposal,
00:01:43 we agreed with their assessment.
00:01:45 That’s when we go into action.
00:01:48 We’ll talk about the angle back and forth with the PID
00:01:51 until we have something that we know will work not only for Italy
00:01:54 but for our worldwide audience on jw.org.
00:01:58 Then we interviewed some brothers who had been imprisoned the longest.
00:02:02 They had to face many challenges,
00:02:04 but they also recalled how their loyalty was a great witness,
00:02:08 especially for some prison guards
00:02:10 who eventually became
00:02:12 Jehovah’s Witnesses as well.
00:02:14 This additional information was confirmed and then added to the story.
00:02:18 Then we sent the draft to OPI.
00:02:21 Once the initial article is written by the branch,
00:02:25 there’s still quite a bit of work that has to be done.
00:02:28 We’ll edit the article, select the photos, write the captions,
00:02:33 send it through proofreading,
00:02:35 and then, lastly, the article is sent back to the Coordinators’ Committee
00:02:40 for their final review and approval.
00:02:42 Shortly after the article was posted
00:02:45 on jw.org
00:02:46 and the Italy PID
00:02:48 informed their local reporters,
00:02:50 over 50 media outlets in Italy covered this story
00:02:55 and wrote articles about this topic.
00:02:57 Well, our hope was that by publicizing this information,
00:03:00 it would not only be encouraging to our brothers and sisters
00:03:04 but it would have a positive impact
00:03:06 on fair-minded officials in other countries
00:03:10 where our brothers are still dealing with this issue of neutrality.
00:03:15 The year 2019 was the 25th anniversary
00:03:17 of the genocide in Rwanda,
00:03:19 so because of that,
00:03:20 there was greater interest
00:03:22 in the scholarly community, in particular,
00:03:25 about what happened during the genocide.
00:03:27 One of the things that OPI was responsible for doing
00:03:30 was to collect experiences of people
00:03:34 who were our brothers and sisters; who saw the violence;
00:03:36 and who survived and helped others to survive,
00:03:38 sometimes at the risk of their own lives.
00:03:40 Our office assisted OPI
00:03:42 in preparing the article in two ways:
00:03:45 first of all, ensuring that the release was accurate
00:03:49 and second, ensuring that the article
00:03:52 gave consideration to the perspective
00:03:55 of those who went through the genocide.
00:03:57 Many of the brothers have been able to read that story on JW News,
00:04:01 and it’s encouraged them
00:04:03 when they see the courage and the faith that our brothers displayed in Rwanda.
00:04:08 OPI has the privilege
00:04:10 of assisting the brothers in Russia.
00:04:13 We prepare news items on JW News.
00:04:16 Once a trial begins, then the team works together
00:04:20 to prepare a JW News item.
00:04:22 We have to do lots of research on the brother’s
00:04:25 or the sister’s personal case history.
00:04:27 Were they raided?
00:04:28 Were they put in pretrial detention?
00:04:30 We can introduce the brother or the sister to the brotherhood,
00:04:33 and then they can pray for them.
00:04:35 Once we’ve put together the material,
00:04:37 we send it to the Public Information Desk.
00:04:40 And on the day of the verdict,
00:04:42 we post a Breaking News  update
00:04:43 to immediately alert the brotherhood.
00:04:46 How can you make the best use of JW News?
00:04:50 Look for opportunities to share news items with your Bible students and others.
00:04:55 Many of these reports show how Jehovah’s people
00:04:57 demonstrate love for one another.
00:05:00 Another way is by praying for our brothers and sisters
00:05:04 that we read about in the Newsroom.
00:05:07 We hope you continue to use the Newsroom to stay informed, to be encouraged,
00:05:12 and to remain united with God’s organization
00:05:15 —“a pillar and support of the truth.”

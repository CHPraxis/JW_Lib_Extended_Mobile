00:00:09 Matthew 9:35 explains
00:00:12 that “Jesus set out on a tour
00:00:14 “of all the cities and villages [of Galilee], . . .
00:00:19 preaching the good news of the Kingdom.”
00:00:23 Thus, rather than slowing down
00:00:26 toward the end of his earthly ministry,
00:00:29 he expanded his efforts
00:00:31 to reach more people.
00:00:35 In the same way,
00:00:37 the Service Committee,
00:00:39 under the direction of the Governing Body,
00:00:42 is expanding
00:00:44 and accelerating the life-saving preaching work
00:00:49 right up to the end.
00:00:52 One way the Service Committee accomplishes this
00:00:56 is through the service departments
00:00:59 in each branch office.
00:01:02 In harmony with the Bible principle
00:01:05 to “let all things take place decently and by arrangement,”
00:01:10 the service departments coordinate the preaching work.
00:01:15 Let’s take a behind-the-scenes look
00:01:18 at how the work of the Service Department in each branch
00:01:22 benefits us.
00:01:24 The Field Ministers Desk
00:01:27 coordinates the assignments of special full-time servants
00:01:30 who take the lead
00:01:33 in the preaching work.
00:01:35 Globally,
00:01:37 there are over 45,000
00:01:38 special full-time servants in the field,
00:01:40 serving in the circuit work,
00:01:42 as special pioneers, and as field missionaries.
00:01:44 The Governing Body knows that they need
00:01:47 practical assistance to carry out their assignments.
00:01:49 Thus, the Field Ministers Desk
00:01:52 looks after their spiritual and physical needs.
00:01:55 This desk helps to find suitable housing
00:01:58 and also ensures that they receive shepherding
00:02:00 and encouragement, especially when they’re facing
00:02:03 challenges in their assignment,
00:02:05 such as health issues or family emergencies.
00:02:09 In order to reach as many people as possible,
00:02:13 the Preaching Needs Desk
00:02:17 oversees a wide range of matters involving the preaching work
00:02:21 of the entire branch territory.
00:02:24 The Preaching Needs Desk
00:02:26 is involved in establishing
00:02:27 special preaching campaigns.
00:02:29 They start by considering
00:02:31 if there is sufficient interest
00:02:33 and resources to justify a campaign.
00:02:37 Sometimes a campaign is supported  from within the branch territory,
00:02:39 and sometimes
00:02:41 a request is made for international support.
00:02:45 I’ve been privileged to share
00:02:47 in four different special
00:02:48 preaching campaigns.
00:02:49 In their own way, they each had a life-changing impact on me.
00:02:53 It was really nice to witness to people who had never heard about Jehovah before
00:02:57 and had never spoken to Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:59 One young man I met was my age.
00:03:02 He was all alone in the refugee camp.
00:03:04 His entire family had died
00:03:06 in his home country when their house was hit by a bomb.
00:03:08 We were able to share the Bible’s promise of a resurrection
00:03:11 and introduce him to the congregation, where he began attending meetings.
00:03:14 It was a special experience I will never forget.
00:03:19 The Preaching Needs Desk also coordinates arrangements
00:03:22 for special metropolitan public witnessing.
00:03:25 When thinking of possible locations,
00:03:28 the brothers look for cities with dense populations and areas
00:03:32 with significant pedestrian, or foot, traffic.
00:03:35 When they find an area with good potential,
00:03:37 capable brothers are assigned to coordinate the work.
00:03:40 This is similar to the way that harbor witnessing is arranged.
00:03:43 In some areas,
00:03:45 there are hundreds or even thousands of volunteers,
00:03:48 so good coordination is extremely important.
00:03:53 More workers are needed in the harvest,
00:03:56 so it’s encouraging to see Jehovah’s people
00:03:58 eagerly respond to the call
00:03:59 and share in public or harbor witnessing,
00:04:02 support special preaching campaigns,
00:04:04 or serve where the need is greater.
00:04:09 At this unique time in history
00:04:12 when all of God’s people are exerting themselves
00:04:16 to preach the good news in all the earth,
00:04:20 the service departments appreciate
00:04:24 the privilege to help organize this great work
00:04:28 that Jehovah is accomplishing.

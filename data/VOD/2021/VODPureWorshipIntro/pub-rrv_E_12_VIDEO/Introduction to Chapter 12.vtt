‎What do you love most 
about Jehovah’s people?

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:07.736 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One of the things close to my heart

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is the unity we all enjoy. 

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We come from a variety
of national, cultural,

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.828 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and ethnic backgrounds. 

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We also have two hopes. 

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some of God’s people have
the hope of life in heaven,

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎while most of us have 
a hope of living on earth

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as subjects of God’s Kingdom. 

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yet, despite these differences,

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’re one spiritual nation.

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s the theme of chapter 12,

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will Make Them One Nation.” 

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This title is taken from Ezekiel 37:22:

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I will make them 
one nation in the land,

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“on the mountains of Israel,

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and one king will rule over all of them,

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and they will no longer be two nations;

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎nor will they be divided 
any longer into two kingdoms.”

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this chapter of the Pure Worship book,

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you’ll learn the answers to these questions:

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What important truth about pure worship 

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎does the prophecy 
about the two sticks highlight?

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why do we conclude

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that this unification prophecy

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎saw its greater fulfillment

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎after 1914? 

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what can you personally do 

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to contribute 
to the precious unity we now enjoy?

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan would love to disrupt our unity. 

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.784 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s not let that happen. 

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:40.746 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May each of us apply 
the points we learn in this chapter.

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If we do our part 
to promote unity in the congregation,

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.127 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we will preserve a haven

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where pure worship will flourish.

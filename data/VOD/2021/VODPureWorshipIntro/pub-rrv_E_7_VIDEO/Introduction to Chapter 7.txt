00:00:01 ‎The Israelites had to deal  with pressure from relatives
00:00:05 ‎who did not serve Jehovah,
00:00:07 ‎and Israel was surrounded  by rich and powerful nations.
00:00:12 ‎When the Israelites relied on Jehovah,
00:00:15 ‎he protected them from their enemies.
00:00:18 ‎Often, though,  his people allowed themselves
00:00:21 ‎to be corrupted by their neighbors.
00:00:24 ‎How did Jehovah respond?
00:00:27 ‎Chapter 7 has the title
00:00:29 ‎“The Nations ‘Will Have to Know That I Am Jehovah.’”
00:00:34 ‎That declaration appears repeatedly throughout Ezekiel’s prophecy.
00:00:40 ‎The theme scripture for this chapter contains a similar thought.
00:00:44 ‎Please read Ezekiel 25:17 with me:
00:00:48 ‎“I will execute on them  great acts of vengeance
00:00:51 ‎“with furious punishments,
00:00:53 ‎“and they will have to know that I am Jehovah
00:00:56 ‎when I bring my vengeance on them.”
00:00:59 ‎We can learn much  by examining the way that the Israelites
00:01:03 ‎interacted with the surrounding people
00:01:05 ‎—including many who were related to them—
00:01:08 ‎and the way that Jehovah responded.
00:01:11 ‎So when you prepare this material,
00:01:14 ‎look for the answers to these questions:
00:01:18 ‎Why should it not surprise us
00:01:21 ‎if family members  oppose our worship of Jehovah?
00:01:25 ‎About what should we remain confident
00:01:27 ‎even if powerful governments persecute us?
00:01:32 ‎What lesson can we learn  from the inhabitants of Tyre?
00:01:37 ‎And how can we show  that we know Jehovah?
00:01:41 ‎As you study this chapter, ask yourself,
00:01:45 ‎‘How can I use the key points  discussed to encourage someone,
00:01:49 ‎‘such as a Bible student,
00:01:51 ‎to prepare for opposition?’
00:01:55 ‎It’s so important  that all of us remain loyal to Jehovah!
00:01:59 ‎Only then can we give him pure worship.

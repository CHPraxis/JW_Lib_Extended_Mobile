‎Bible prophecies build our faith. 

00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:08.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At times, though, 
we may find it challenging

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to grasp them fully. 

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s true 
that understanding Bible prophecy

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎requires humility, 
hard work, and holy spirit. 

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the rewards are worth the effort.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:25.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Consider, for example, 
the vision that Ezekiel saw

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of a temple located 
on a lofty mountain. 

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Read with me, 
please, the instructions

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah gave to the prophet,

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:37.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎recorded at Ezekiel 43:10:

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“As for you, son of man,

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“describe the temple 
to the house of Israel,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“so that they will feel ashamed 
because of their errors,

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they should study its plan.” 

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you can see, the title of chapter 13,

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Describe the Temple,” 
is drawn from that verse. 

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.123 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This chapter 
will help clarify our understanding

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of this prophecy. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.463 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During your study, 
look for these key points:

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What simple approach are we taking

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in our discussion 
of Ezekiel’s temple vision? 

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why do we no longer say

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Ezekiel saw 
the great spiritual temple

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:22.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the apostle Paul later explains? 

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:25.356 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For Ezekiel and his fellow exiles,

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what was the overall prophetic message

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.402 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the temple vision?

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Take time to meditate

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on this prophetic vision. 

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you do, ask yourself,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘What does this teach me 
about Jehovah’s personality?’ 

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thinking about this vision 
will impress on us

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the need to give Jehovah 
undivided, pure worship.

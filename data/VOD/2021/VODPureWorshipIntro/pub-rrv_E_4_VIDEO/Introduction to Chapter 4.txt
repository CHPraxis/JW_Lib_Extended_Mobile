00:00:01 ‎Parents, you no doubt love
00:00:04 ‎to teach your children about Jehovah.
00:00:07 ‎Many of you likely use  the pictures and videos supplied
00:00:10 ‎by the faithful slave  to help you teach basic truths
00:00:14 ‎about our loving God.
00:00:16 ‎But pictures can also help us understand deeper truths about Jehovah.
00:00:21 ‎Please read with me
00:00:23 ‎Ezekiel 1:5, 6, and 10:
00:00:28 ‎“Within it were what looked like  four living creatures,
00:00:31 ‎“and the appearance  of each one was like that of a human.
00:00:35 ‎“Each one had four faces and four wings.
00:00:38 ‎“Their faces had this appearance:
00:00:41 ‎“Each of the four had a man’s face
00:00:43 ‎“with a lion’s face on the right,
00:00:45 ‎“a bull’s face on the left,
00:00:47 ‎and each of the four had an eagle’s face.”
00:00:50 ‎These verses are discussed  in the chapter entitled
00:00:53 ‎“Who Are ‘the Living Creatures  With Four Faces’?”
00:00:57 ‎As you consider this material,  look for these key points:
00:01:02 ‎Why do the faces of a man, a lion,
00:01:05 ‎a bull, and an eagle
00:01:07 ‎especially reflect Jehovah’s strength  and mightiness?
00:01:12 ‎In what ways are you already benefiting
00:01:14 ‎from expressions  of Jehovah’s outstanding attributes?
00:01:19 ‎Why can we conclude  that the four faces of the cherubs
00:01:22 ‎when viewed together  represent all of Jehovah’s attributes?
00:01:27 ‎How does this vision  of Ezekiel assure you
00:01:30 ‎that you are never  beyond the reach of Jehovah’s love?
00:01:35 ‎If possible, answer as often  as you can during the study.
00:01:40 ‎Your answers will encourage  your brothers and sisters.
00:01:43 ‎But they’ll do more.
00:01:46 ‎They’ll tell Jehovah  how you feel about him,
00:01:49 ‎and they’ll strengthen your resolve
00:01:51 ‎to give Jehovah pure worship.

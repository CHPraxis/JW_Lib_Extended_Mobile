‎Jehovah loves justice.

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:08.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He’d never destroy 
the righteous with the wicked

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—that would be unjust and unloving.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For instance, 
before Jehovah executed judgment

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on unfaithful Jerusalem,

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he lovingly assured his prophet Ezekiel

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that faithful ones would be spared.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel saw a vision
of someone marking people

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who’d survive God’s judgment. 

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Who receive that mark? 

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Who does the marking?

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And when are individuals
marked for survival?

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 16 discusses this thrilling vision. 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.612 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The title is

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Put a Mark on the Foreheads,”

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which is taken from Ezekiel 9:4:

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Jehovah said to him:

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Go through the city,
through Jerusalem,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.045 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘and put a mark 
on the foreheads of the men

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.673 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘who are sighing and groaning
over all the detestable things

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that are being done in the city.’”

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This chapter will answer

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎two important questions:

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First, 
how does Ezekiel’s vision of the man

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with the secretary’s inkhorn

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:26.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎highlight Jehovah’s mercy? 

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Second, 
what do you need to do now

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in order to be marked 
in the future for survival?

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:38.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How loving of Jehovah

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.456 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to assure us that he’ll deliver 
his faithful worshippers

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when he executes judgment

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on this wicked system of things! 

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Meanwhile,
may this chapter move you

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to exert yourself in the lifesaving work

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of preaching the good news,

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎thereby helping as many as possible

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to come in line 
to be marked for survival.

‎Can you imagine 
what it would have been like

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to be with Ezekiel

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:10.239 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when he saw 
the vision of Jehovah’s chariot,

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the cherubs, 
and those giant wheels? 

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Section 1 of the Pure Worship book,

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Heavens Were Opened,”

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will consider in detail

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this portion of Ezekiel’s prophecy.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn with me, please,

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and follow along as we read Ezekiel 1:1:

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In the 30th year, 
on the fifth day of the fourth month,

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“while I was among the exiled people

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:38.267 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“by the river Chebar,

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“the heavens were opened

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I began to see visions of God.” 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What’s the setting? 

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel and thousands of Israelites

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are held captive
near the great city of Babylon. 

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Has Jehovah abandoned his people? 

00:00:56.952 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are the Babylonian gods 
more powerful than Jehovah? 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What Ezekiel now sees in vision

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎leaves him in no doubt

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—Jehovah is the Almighty,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the only God worthy of worship! 

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what does Ezekiel see? 

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s continue our reading

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with verses 4, 26, and 27. 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.941 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“As I was looking,

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I saw a tempestuous wind 
coming from the north,

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and there was a huge cloud

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and flashing fire 
surrounded by a bright light,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and from the midst of the fire

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:43.707 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“was something that looked like electrum. 

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:47.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Above the expanse that was over their heads

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:50.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“was what looked like a sapphire stone,

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and it resembled a throne. 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.845 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Sitting on the throne up above was someone

00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:00.933 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“whose appearance resembled that of a human. 

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.353 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I saw something glowing like electrum

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that was like a fire

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:11.652 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“radiating from what 
appeared to be his waist and upward;

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and from his waist down,

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.241 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I saw something that resembled fire. 

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There was a brilliance all around him.” 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What does the chariot that Ezekiel saw represent,

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how do we know that? 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What can we learn from the chariot’s wheels

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:33.507 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the way the vehicle moved? 

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How was Ezekiel affected by his vision,

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how does meditating on it affect you? 

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:45.227 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How can we show that we are awed

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:48.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by the privilege of serving Jehovah

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎along with his organization today?

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These questions will be answered

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:58.282 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as you consider this chapter entitled

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Began to See Visions of God.”

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.959 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Each meeting you attend 
opens and concludes with prayer.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.336 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Before you close your eyes to pray,

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎picture the huge chariot that Ezekiel saw

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the One seated on the throne. 

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Doing so will deepen your appreciation

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the privilege of prayer

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and will strengthen your resolve

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to give Jehovah
the pure worship that belongs to him.

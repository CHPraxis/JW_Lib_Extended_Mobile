00:00:01 ‎Jehovah has appointed “the faithful  and discreet slave” to be a watchman.
00:00:06 ‎Now, in Bible times,  a watchman might blow a horn
00:00:10 ‎or sound an alarm  to warn of approaching danger.
00:00:14 ‎But watchmen often did  more than just warn people.
00:00:18 ‎Now, Jehovah appointed Ezekiel  as a watchman.
00:00:22 ‎Please read with me Ezekiel 33:7,
00:00:26 ‎and see what Jehovah told him to do.
00:00:28 ‎“As for you, son of man,
00:00:31 ‎“I have appointed you  as a watchman to the house of Israel;
00:00:35 ‎“and when you hear  a word from my mouth
00:00:38 ‎you must warn them from me.”
00:00:40 ‎The chapter you’re about to consider  in the Pure Worship book
00:00:44 ‎is based on that scripture  and has the title
00:00:47 ‎“I Have Appointed You as a Watchman.”
00:00:51 ‎As you discuss this material,
00:00:53 ‎you’ll learn what else  is required of a watchman,
00:00:56 ‎and you’ll gain insight  into Jehovah’s personality.
00:00:59 ‎Look for the answers  to these questions:
00:01:02 ‎What motivates Jehovah  to appoint watchmen?
00:01:07 ‎What twofold message  do the watchmen deliver?
00:01:11 ‎And what is your role  in supporting pure worship?
00:01:16 ‎Now, it can be a challenge
00:01:18 ‎to do the work  that Jehovah has assigned to us.
00:01:21 ‎But please be assured  that “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:01:25 ‎appreciates your help and support.
00:01:29 ‎And you can be sure  that Jehovah appreciates your hard work,
00:01:33 ‎your endurance, and your loyalty.
00:01:37 ‎The material you’re  about to discuss will give you courage,
00:01:40 ‎and it will help you  to do your part in upholding pure worship.

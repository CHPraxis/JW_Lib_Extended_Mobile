00:00:01 ‎Do you enjoy serving Jehovah
00:00:03 ‎along with his united,  spiritually clean people?
00:00:06 ‎No doubt you do.
00:00:08 ‎What you’re experiencing  is a modern-day miracle,
00:00:12 ‎one foretold by the prophet Ezekiel.
00:00:15 ‎That prophecy is stated  in the title of chapter 9,
00:00:18 ‎“I Will Give Them a Unified Heart.”
00:00:22 ‎It’s found at Ezekiel 11:19:
00:00:26 ‎“And I will give them a unified heart,
00:00:30 ‎“and I will put a new spirit in them;
00:00:33 ‎“and I will remove the heart of stone  from their bodies
00:00:36 ‎and give them a heart of flesh.”
00:00:40 ‎This chapter of the Pure Worship book
00:00:42 ‎will help you to answer these questions:
00:00:46 ‎What was Babylonian captivity  like for the Jews,
00:00:50 ‎and why did Jehovah  eventually liberate his people?
00:00:54 ‎How was the Christian congregation corrupted,
00:00:57 ‎and what happened that was similar to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews?
00:01:03 ‎What promises of restoration  did Jehovah make through Ezekiel,
00:01:07 ‎and how have they been fulfilled
00:01:09 ‎on true Christians during the last days?
00:01:12 ‎How can we show that we appreciate
00:01:15 ‎the way that Jehovah  has restored pure worship in our time?
00:01:20 ‎It’s our hope that this material
00:01:23 ‎will strengthen your faith in God’s promises,
00:01:26 ‎increase your appreciation  for the truths you’ve learned,
00:01:29 ‎and deepen your desire to invite others to join us
00:01:33 ‎in giving Jehovah pure worship.

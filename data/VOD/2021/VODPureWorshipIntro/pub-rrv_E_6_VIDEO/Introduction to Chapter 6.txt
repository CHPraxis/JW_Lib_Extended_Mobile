00:00:02 ‎Jehovah asked the prophet Ezekiel  to do some strange things.
00:00:06 ‎For example, on one occasion
00:00:08 ‎Ezekiel sat speechless for a week.
00:00:12 ‎Then he suddenly got up  and shut himself in his house.
00:00:15 ‎When he came out again,
00:00:17 ‎he picked up a brick and etched it with a drawing.
00:00:21 ‎Ezekiel’s actions were unusual,
00:00:23 ‎but they conveyed an important message
00:00:26 ‎that has meaning for us today.
00:00:29 ‎Chapter 6 of the Pure Worship book
00:00:32 ‎discusses Ezekiel’s unusual actions.
00:00:35 ‎It is entitled “The End Is Now Upon You.”
00:00:39 ‎That statement is found at Ezekiel 7:3,
00:00:42 ‎the theme scripture for this chapter:
00:00:45 ‎“The end is now upon you,
00:00:47 ‎“and I will unleash  my anger against you,
00:00:50 ‎“and I will judge you  according to your ways
00:00:53 ‎and call you to account  for all your detestable deeds.”
00:00:57 ‎As you study this material,
00:01:00 ‎look for the answers  to these three questions:
00:01:04 ‎The events that Ezekiel acted out
00:01:07 ‎remind us of what momentous events that God’s Word foretold for our future?
00:01:13 ‎How does the way Ezekiel carried out
00:01:15 ‎his commission to preach Jehovah’s warnings
00:01:18 ‎affect your view of the ministry?
00:01:21 ‎Why might the prophecies  that we consider in this chapter
00:01:25 ‎move you to reexamine your priorities?
00:01:29 ‎Allow what you learn  in this chapter to affect you
00:01:32 ‎as you set priorities for yourself.
00:01:35 ‎May the choices you make  help you to give Jehovah
00:01:39 ‎the pure worship  he so richly deserves.

00:00:07 I started to study the Bible in 1993.
00:00:11 At that time, I was 43 years old.
00:00:13 I was married for 19 years, and I had two children.
00:00:18 At that time, I didn’t know if I would become
00:00:20 one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or not.
00:00:23 But I accepted a Bible study.
00:00:27 At my husband’s request, I started studying the Bible at the same time,
00:00:31 but I only studied for about a year.
00:00:34 Then I decided, ‘I’m going to stop.’
00:00:37 I asked him to stop studying too.
00:00:40 I told him: “Let’s stop studying.
00:00:42 “This is not for us.
00:00:44 We don’t understand it.”
00:00:47 But in a very diplomatic and calm way,
00:00:50 he said he would continue.
00:00:53 When I realized he would continue studying, I said to myself:
00:00:57 ‘Well, all right then.
00:00:58 ‘Just you wait and see.
00:01:00 ‘If you really want to continue, I will somehow make you stop studying
00:01:05 (in a subtle way), but I will do it.’
00:01:08 Just seeing him get ready to go in field service annoyed me so much.
00:01:12 I started burying him with household chores,
00:01:15 asking him to help me more and more around the house.
00:01:21 But calmly and gently every time,
00:01:23 he would ask me if he could prepare for meetings.
00:01:29 And one time when he asked me if he could prepare for the meeting,
00:01:33 yet again I got irritated and said:
00:01:35 “You’re not going to prepare now.
00:01:37 We’re going to clean the whole apartment thoroughly.”
00:01:41 After we were finally finished at midnight,
00:01:45 he asked me very calmly
00:01:47 if there was anything else he could help me with.
00:01:52 It was not easy for him to deal with my efforts
00:01:54 to force him to stop studying.
00:01:57 And after he got baptized,
00:01:59 I tried even harder.
00:02:01 But he never retaliated; he stayed calm and endured it.
00:02:07 In this period, I was trying to understand her reactions.
00:02:14 But it wasn’t easy for me.
00:02:19 Hearing her criticisms, those harsh replies, I thought sometimes:
00:02:24 ‘I think I’ll just give up.
00:02:26 It makes no sense to go on like this.’
00:02:31 I said to the brother who was studying with me about this,
00:02:34 “I want to stop.”
00:02:37 And he encouraged me.
00:02:39 He said: “No, no, no, don’t stop.
00:02:42 “Don’t quit.
00:02:43 “Continue, continue.
00:02:45 Probably your wife will follow you.”
00:02:48 These conversations always encouraged me,
00:02:51 and when we finished our study,
00:02:53 I would see things from a different perspective.
00:02:58 I always loved my wife,
00:03:00 and I wanted her to be by my side.
00:03:06 During this period, he often told me how much he loved me
00:03:10 —many times, yes, very often.
00:03:13 And sometimes he would ask me if I loved him too.
00:03:16 There were times when I would answer him,
00:03:19 and there were times when I just smiled and said nothing.
00:03:24 And I even thought, ‘Hey, this guy really cares about me.’
00:03:30 I was impressed by his kindness.
00:03:32 I was very impressed.
00:03:35 Many times, I was musing: ‘Well, as a man, he could hit me.
00:03:39 He could be demanding, “You will sit down,”’ you know.
00:03:42 But no, he never did that.
00:03:45 He never raised his voice, never spoke a mean word
00:03:49 —never.
00:03:51 When she saw that I did not retaliate
00:03:54 —as in I would not reply harshly and I would not talk badly to her—
00:03:57 then eventually
00:03:59 she would calm down.
00:04:02 In his calm and mild way, he began inviting me to the meetings.
00:04:07 He kept on inviting me, and sometimes I was willing to accept.
00:04:11 Slowly, I started to attend the meetings.
00:04:14 I was happy.
00:04:16 I was very happy when she said she wanted to resume her study.
00:04:22 In August 2006,
00:04:24 I started studying the Bible again.
00:04:27 And in March 2007, I became an unbaptized publisher.
00:04:31 And in July 2007, I decided to get baptized.
00:04:39 I served in the Baptism Department,
00:04:43 and I had the privilege
00:04:48 to personally baptize my dear wife.
00:05:08 First Corinthians 13:4 says
00:05:11 that “love is patient and kind.”
00:05:14 Patience means,
00:05:16 first of all, being patient for months,
00:05:19 years, or maybe even decades.
00:05:22 Never give up.
00:05:25 Never consider someone as a lost cause.

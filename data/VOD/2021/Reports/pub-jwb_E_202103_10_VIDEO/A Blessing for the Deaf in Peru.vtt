Before, we had the written <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t understand it.

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.275 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the meeting,

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:48.360 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t really grasp everything either,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I didn’t feel confident
to raise my hand and comment.

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:52.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I tried to study the magazine,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.825 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t understand it,

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:56.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and neither could the other deaf brothers.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:58.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the meetings, it was frustrating

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not being able to understand.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
From the very beginning,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we saw Jehovah’s hand in matters.

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.505 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1996, we went from being a small group

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a congregation,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then more groups were formed
in different parts of the country.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, even assemblies
were interpreted in Peruvian Sign Language.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we realized

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our deaf brothers and sisters
couldn’t progress any further,

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this was because they didn’t have

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:29.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an official translation
of the <i>Watchtower</i>  magazine

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own language.

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:34.365 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The deaf wanted

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to participate in the meetings,

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:37.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but they always had to rely on us

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:40.245 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to understand the publications.

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just so frustrating for them.

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of them didn’t even want
a copy of the publication

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they felt powerless to understand it.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.805 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For many years, the deaf brothers begged:

00:01:57.805 --> 00:01:59.848 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Please, we want <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:02.142 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We need to prepare in our own language!”

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even received videos
from different parts of the country saying,

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:08.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ask the Branch Committee, the Governing Body

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we need <i>The Watchtower,</i> please!”

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the letter arrived saying,
“Yes, you can translate <i>The Watchtower,”</i>

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were jumping with joy!

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to shout out loud and tell them,

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brothers, here is your <i>Watchtower!”</i>

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we had to control ourselves and wait
for the moment of the official announcement

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah would say,
‘Here is your gift, <i>The Watchtower!’</i>

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they made the announcement
about the new <i>Watchtower </i> in sign language,

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers were jumping out of their seats!

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole place was just electrified!

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:06.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was cheering!

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i> in Peruvian Sign Language?

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:09.960 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.796 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy that I started to cry.

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many benefits to having
<i>The Watchtower </i> in Peruvian Sign Language.

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers can download it from the website

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two months ahead of time
and prepare without stress.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another excellent benefit is that now
the elders who are deaf

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can study and understand the <i>Watchtower</i>

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare it
in order to conduct at the meeting

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:31.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s in their own language.

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:35.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, not only can
our deaf brothers and sisters

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive their own spiritual food

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directly from the official translation
of the <i>Watchtower</i>  magazine,

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even better,
they receive the spiritual food

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:47.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the same time as any other language group
in the world.

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.306 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I view <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.308 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I can understand everything!

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:10.187 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My heart is overflowing with happiness.

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:13.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so thankful to Jehovah for this support.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What I’m learning now

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:17.486 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is helping me to progress spiritually.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:19.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I am very happy that now

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I can deepen my friendship with Jehovah!

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:23.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now that we have <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:25.494 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Peruvian Sign Language,

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:28.831 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m so excited and it touches my heart.

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the best feeling in the world

00:04:30.874 --> 00:04:34.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all my deaf brothers and sisters
can understand just like I can.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:40.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual light is progressively getting
“brighter and brighter” for us.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s obvious that Jehovah’s spirit
is guiding the work.

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, this light is reaching our hearts.

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now <i>all</i>  the deaf in Peru
are benefiting from this blessing.

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so, so thankful to you, Jehovah!

Faith in Jehovah has allowed ordinary people

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do extraordinary things.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This kind of faith is still active today

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still has the power to help us

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through any difficulty.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s travel across the globe

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how deep reliance on Jehovah

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped many overcome their unique trials.

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we visit each land,

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll enjoy a story of faith

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared both from the perspective
of close friends

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the individuals involved.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to our first destination.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South Africa is full of contrasts

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and diversity.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Big, modern cities mix
with poorer remote areas.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many volunteers
in Kingdom Hall construction,

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this presents wonderful opportunities

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:38.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also unique challenges that require faith

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example of that
is our young friend Namhla.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:46.293 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I really appreciated

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:47.378 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the faith she showed

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.505 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to make herself available

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep her joy in her assignment.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:56.637 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m the only Jehovah’s Witness in my family.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What my mother desired the most for me

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to grow up,

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to college

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in time, get a high-paying job.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My congregation was busy
building a Kingdom Hall,

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:17.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I would sometimes also go to help.

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to see and feel the joy
that those brothers were having

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
building Kingdom Halls.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom didn’t like it when she heard

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was going to help
with Kingdom Hall construction.

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She felt that I was wasting my time.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I arrived on-site,
everything I did was for the first time.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:44.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have skills,
and I had never done this work before.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not easy.

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:49.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I get tired

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:52.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mentally exhausted
and even physically exhausted.

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s difficult
to even read the Bible.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to wash up and go to sleep.

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:07.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was important for Namhla
to find her spiritual balance

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because her spirituality

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was more important

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than working hard on-site.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to be really determined

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:22.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because my spirituality
was not the same as before.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that I needed to make a change.

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made it a priority to read the Bible first

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to think about the things I read.

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also made sure that I was regular
in going out in the ministry.

00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer helped a lot

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because prayer is the best way
for me to tell Jehovah

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that concern me.

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:52.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen for myself
how Jehovah God has sustained me.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen that she is much more balanced.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom would phone and ask,

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Namhla, how is the project going?”

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she would say,

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If this makes you happy,
then I am also happy.”

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:11.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I had my fears,

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but faith made me confident

00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:15.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God would always be there

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support me in everything I do.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Canada is a diverse country

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both the landscape

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, because of immigration,
the people and their languages.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:49.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to share Bible truth
with these ones,

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many brothers are learning a new language,

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like my friend Shaquille.

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Shaquille got invited to Bethel,

00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:00.445 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had the privilege of serving

00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:02.447 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the Canada branch at the time.

00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:04.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was such a pleasure
to see this young man

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:07.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had all these wonderful goals
and to see one by one

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:10.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah opening those doors to him.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had made a promise to Jehovah
as a young person.

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:17.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I want to help those

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:19.840 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that don’t have anyone to help them.

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw good in me,

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he invested in me,
and he was very patient with me,

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:29.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saw it through every brother and sister
who sincerely reached out to help me.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditating on Jehovah’s qualities
—you want to imitate him.

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:36.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to show the kindness that he
has shown toward you and toward others.

00:05:36.064 --> 00:05:40.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a foreign language, I feel
like there is a giant opportunity to do that.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to learn Punjabi,
and I never regretted it.

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:45.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It changed my service to Jehovah.

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:52.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a time period in my Bethel service

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was really, really sick,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was a kind of sickness

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:59.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I didn’t know why it was happening.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doctor could tell me why it was happening.

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:03.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It affected my physical appearance,

00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:07.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it seemed liked torment
throughout each and every day.

00:06:08.764 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of times, I would have rather
not been seen.

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:16.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So serving in a foreign language now
when you’re one of the people

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:19.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is spiritually supposed
to be strengthening others,

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:20.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’re going
through a hard time yourself,

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:23.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a massive challenge for me.

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:28.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of his friends
just really appreciated

00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:31.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith that he had to overcome that.

00:06:31.453 --> 00:06:34.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though it was
a very low point in his life,

00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:37.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he really hung on to Jehovah.

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m in this assignment and I’ve seen
that Jehovah has blessed me,

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:45.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would lead me to conclude
that he’s going to stop?

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:50.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t sleep; he just couldn’t continue
at Bethel either.

00:06:50.013 --> 00:06:51.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had left Bethel.

00:06:51.765 --> 00:06:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, my health was decreasing,
and it was getting really bad.

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was getting to the point that doctors

00:06:57.062 --> 00:06:59.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed concern
about maybe an organ failing

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things like that.

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:04.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they did not give me any way out.

00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:05.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no way out.

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept making progress

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though there were certainly
some really difficult times for him.

00:07:11.827 --> 00:07:16.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to take a realistic approach
toward my new situation,

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to figure out, “OK, how
am I going to put Kingdom interests first

00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while materially taking care of myself

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:27.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and hopefully figure out why I’m sick

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if I can do anything about it?”

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:33.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, he decided
to stick with the foreign language.

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:37.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something I really learned
from Shaquille is

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:42.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he really took the Scriptures
and made it personal.

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:47.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would read it as if he was the person
in the Scriptures,

00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:49.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would meditate on it,

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:53.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he could see how,
even though he didn’t know the answers,

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would help him
through his difficult times.

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what am I going to do?

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:02.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to live up
to what I promised to Jehovah.

00:08:02.127 --> 00:08:05.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, he serves with his wife
in the Punjabi field.

00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:10.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a loving shepherd, and he
even instructs Punjabi-language classes.

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:35.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Indonesia, people work very hard.

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:38.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They seek stability through a secure job.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can have a powerful influence
on the brothers and sisters

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:46.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they may feel
that they can’t expand their ministry.

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:51.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I met the Jatmikos,
they were working toward pioneer service.

00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:55.097 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When they started, I asked them,

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:56.598 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to be used

00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:58.392 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more fully by Jehovah?”

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:00.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was confused.

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:04.773 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We felt that the pioneer service itself was

00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:07.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already a big accomplishment.

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:11.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I encouraged them to think
about the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:17.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never imagined applying for SKE.

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was tempting.

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:22.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to be used by Jehovah,

00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:24.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:27.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would happen to us after graduation?

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:32.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we be assigned?

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:34.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would be our assignment?

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:38.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed more faith,

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:43.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we prayed a lot about that.

00:09:43.228 --> 00:09:45.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered my prayers

00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:48.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the brothers and sisters
in the congregation.

00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mardha had a prestigious job.

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:55.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was even being offered many scholarships

00:09:55.615 --> 00:09:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she could pursue higher education

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and further advance her career.

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:05.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters
never criticized Mardha’s work choice.

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:08.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they showed us the joys

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving Jehovah more fully.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:14.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was still deciding what to do,

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:18.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of them asked me
about my spiritual goals

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:20.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what I could see myself doing.

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:23.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking about such questions

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
convinced me to choose SKE.

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:32.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were invited to attend the school.

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:35.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to leave their jobs, their house,

00:10:35.447 --> 00:10:38.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the comforts of the place and city
where they lived.

00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:41.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were assigned to a small congregation.

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:43.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to pray even more

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask Jehovah God
for guidance and direction.

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they’re serving in the traveling work,

00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a circuit.

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced

00:10:56.426 --> 00:11:00.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was not due
to any greatness on our part

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:01.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because of Jehovah’s help.

00:11:03.183 --> 00:11:05.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to be used by Jehovah

00:11:06.144 --> 00:11:08.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we want to serve him,

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:13.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can use us in many different ways.

00:11:32.754 --> 00:11:36.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fiji is a beautiful place.

00:11:38.385 --> 00:11:41.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, one thing that is common here

00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:43.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is poverty.

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:49.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That is the situation Sister Bakata faces.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband was a hard worker.

00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:59.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were out in the water,
he cried out from the mangroves.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went and found him,

00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:08.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that it was a stroke.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to take on both roles
as husband and wife.

00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:17.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would farm; I would fish.

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a difficult life.

00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:27.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a sister was sick.

00:12:28.852 --> 00:12:32.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though Sister Bakata faced challenges,

00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:37.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was any washing or cleaning
needed for the sick sister,

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was happy to go and help with that too.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think back to when a cyclone hit Kadavu

00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Cyclone Keni.

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:56.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared by the damage
it did to our house.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our outdoor kitchen was blown off.

00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:04.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard about the things
that happened to the brothers,

00:13:04.596 --> 00:13:07.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so sorry for them.

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:11.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their roofs were blown away,

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:13.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the walls had fallen down.

00:13:17.817 --> 00:13:21.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about what Sister Bakata did.

00:13:21.154 --> 00:13:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had 20 Fijian dollars.

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the only money she had,

00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:35.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she decided to give all of that
to the brothers.

00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:42.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have any other way to help them.

00:13:43.468 --> 00:13:46.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is “the God of love.”

00:13:46.054 --> 00:13:48.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like it says at 1 John 4:8,

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:51.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his main quality is love.

00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:53.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that love,

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:56.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gave the money from the bottom of my heart.

00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:02.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that even though we are poor,

00:14:02.737 --> 00:14:06.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still be generous
to assist our brothers.

00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:11.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I gave,

00:14:11.496 --> 00:14:14.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more Jehovah gave back to me.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Till today,

00:14:17.627 --> 00:14:20.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve always had what we’ve needed.

00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:45.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Peru, like many places around the world,

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:49.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters need to work hard.

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:58.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benjamín and Doris have to make
good use of their resources

00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:01.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to provide for their family.

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:06.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to give our children
a spiritual heritage.

00:15:07.135 --> 00:15:09.596 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We want them to be able to serve Jehovah

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:11.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by watching how we are doing it.

00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We watch a lot of videos that help us.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often remember the video

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Abilio and Ulla.

00:15:19.689 --> 00:15:22.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also had three children.

00:15:22.358 --> 00:15:26.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They moved to another place and grew up
in a very nice, spiritual atmosphere.

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:30.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are serving Jehovah now as adults.

00:15:31.326 --> 00:15:33.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we asked ourselves,

00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:36.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Could we move to another place
where the need is greater?’

00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:41.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It takes faith to go to an unfamiliar place.

00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:45.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One video on jw.org that helped us a lot

00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about the family from England
who moved to Ecuador.

00:15:48.384 --> 00:15:50.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, they went for one month.

00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:53.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we said
that we should also go visit first.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going to another country
would have been exciting

00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:58.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been super,

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:03.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our economic situation
wouldn’t allow us to go that far.

00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We took a trip together with our children
to visit a territory that had a need

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:11.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called Calango.

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes about an hour and a half
to get there.

00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:16.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They liked the geography of the area

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:18.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the vegetation.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many things
that captured their attention.

00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things that I like in Calango
are playing and preaching.

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:33.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were unable to move to the city of Calango

00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:37.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the economic situation
that the people face there.

00:16:37.058 --> 00:16:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to get a job there.

00:16:39.686 --> 00:16:41.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for that reason,

00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:46.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we decided to travel to Calango
on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work the other days here in Pachacamác.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have felt that Jehovah is helping us

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:56.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he has made it possible to work here.

00:16:56.202 --> 00:16:58.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the money that we earn in those days

00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:02.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows us to be with our brothers there.

00:17:03.126 --> 00:17:06.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We needed to know how to keep things simple.

00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:10.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that from the videos on jw.org.

00:17:10.842 --> 00:17:15.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hard work that they do proves to me
that they really love Jehovah.

00:17:15.847 --> 00:17:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fully trust that Jehovah is our Father.

00:17:19.475 --> 00:17:20.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the Dad.

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:24.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Dad
always comes through for his children.

00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:28.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that faith is something
that greatly motivates them.

00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The videos on jw.org had given us

00:17:30.486 --> 00:17:32.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the push that we needed.

00:17:33.615 --> 00:17:36.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed those videos
in order to take action

00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:39.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move to another area.

00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:59.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Across Russia,

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers have successfully faced decades

00:18:02.518 --> 00:18:05.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of persecution and ban.

00:18:05.813 --> 00:18:08.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Budenchuks, like so many families there,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still face these challenges today.

00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:16.407 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On June 12, 2018,

00:18:16.407 --> 00:18:19.577 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at 5:30 a.m.,

00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:22.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
armed men burst into our home.

00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:28.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They threw my husband to the floor
and handcuffed him.

00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:33.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, they sent my husband
to a pretrial detention facility

00:18:33.466 --> 00:18:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 11 months.

00:18:35.718 --> 00:18:39.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was frightening
just imagining certain things.

She didn’t find it easy and shed many tears.

00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:47.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really worried
about how I would care for the children

00:18:47.313 --> 00:18:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I would fulfill
their needs spiritually,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and physically.

00:18:54.445 --> 00:18:56.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer calmed me down

00:18:56.447 --> 00:19:00.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I wanted, of course,
to react very emotionally

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:03.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everything
—to the injustice that we were facing.

00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:07.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the court hearings were going on,

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:10.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters would come.

00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:13.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a support
—so strengthening!

00:19:17.385 --> 00:19:20.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On September 19, 2019,

00:19:20.763 --> 00:19:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the court convicted my husband

00:19:24.058 --> 00:19:26.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sent him to a prison colony

00:19:26.394 --> 00:19:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for three and a half years.

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:34.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In January 2020,

00:19:34.652 --> 00:19:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new disaster hit us.

00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:41.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1:00 a.m., our house burned to the ground.

00:19:43.202 --> 00:19:45.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stood there near the house,

00:19:46.622 --> 00:19:50.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my son, Yegor, suggested saying a prayer.

00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:53.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t remember the prayer,

00:19:53.504 --> 00:19:55.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but afterward I felt calmer.

00:19:56.883 --> 00:19:58.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then cars started coming to the house.

00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:01.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was our brothers and sisters.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:04.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was frozen, shaking from the cold,

00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:07.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they dressed me like a small child.

00:20:08.352 --> 00:20:11.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought us hot tea, food

00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:13.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything of the highest quality.

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:25.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one month after the fire,

00:20:28.456 --> 00:20:31.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they took my husband
to the prison colony,

00:20:31.626 --> 00:20:33.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
officers there beat him up.

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:40.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I found out about it,
it was so hard for me

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:45.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I didn’t know how to help my husband

00:20:45.765 --> 00:20:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how he was feeling.

00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tanya copes with hardships very courageously.

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:58.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah, sometimes all night.

00:20:58.611 --> 00:21:01.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt as though Jehovah gave me

00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:04.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
painkillers to dull my pain.

00:21:06.327 --> 00:21:08.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Aleksey,
tries to take care of us.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the pretrial detention facility,
for example,

00:21:11.249 --> 00:21:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each day he wrote
letters of encouragement to us,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we read together as a family.

00:21:16.754 --> 00:21:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dear family: Remember the qualities
that we need right now

00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:24.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—endurance, courage, calmness

00:21:24.345 --> 00:21:27.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important, faith.

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:31.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like the thought that after winter,
summer always comes;

00:21:31.644 --> 00:21:34.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the night, the day arrives;

00:21:34.272 --> 00:21:39.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after the darkest days,
there will definitely come a sunny one.

00:21:40.444 --> 00:21:44.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout all these trials,
having a good spiritual schedule

00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:46.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reading the Bible
has given me strength.

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:51.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we prepare for meetings
and participate in the ministry.

00:21:51.831 --> 00:21:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really afraid to do it,

00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:59.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this situation has helped me
to see Jehovah’s support.

00:21:59.964 --> 00:22:03.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have realized
that even in my circumstances,

00:22:03.134 --> 00:22:05.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still help others.

00:22:05.428 --> 00:22:09.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah
has already given us his support,

00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:12.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we believe
that he will continue to support us.

00:22:12.476 --> 00:22:14.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their example of courage

00:22:14.896 --> 00:22:18.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and steadfast faith
in the face of difficulties and trials

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that we can also remain faithful.

00:22:21.569 --> 00:22:23.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can make Jehovah happy

00:22:23.571 --> 00:22:26.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue to serve him
without becoming discouraged.

00:22:26.574 --> 00:22:29.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have learned to trust more in Jehovah

00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:33.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to panic
when a difficult situation arises.

00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:36.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These difficulties have made me stronger,

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:39.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to overcome
many of the fears I used to have,

00:22:39.503 --> 00:22:44.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthened my faith
and my desire to help others.

00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:52.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we have seen,

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:54.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers the world over

00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to show strong faith.

00:22:59.148 --> 00:23:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they do it?

00:23:04.153 --> 00:23:07.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A regular study of God’s Word,

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time spent in deep meditation,

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:16.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeking His direction in prayer.

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:19.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did this allow them to accomplish?

00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through faith, our brothers handled
theocratic building assignments;

00:23:25.341 --> 00:23:27.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learned foreign languages;

00:23:27.718 --> 00:23:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended theocratic schools;

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:33.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though poor, remained generous;

00:23:33.891 --> 00:23:36.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served where the need was greater;

00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and preached despite persecution.

00:23:40.356 --> 00:23:44.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows we can do the same.

00:23:44.443 --> 00:23:49.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we let faith move us to action,

00:23:49.156 --> 00:23:53.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those actions will strengthen our faith.

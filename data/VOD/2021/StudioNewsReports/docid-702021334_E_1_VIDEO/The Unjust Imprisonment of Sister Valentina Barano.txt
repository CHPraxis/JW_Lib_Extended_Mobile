00:00:01 On February 24, 2021,
00:00:03 the Abakan City Court convicted
00:00:06 70-year-old Valentina Baranovskaya and her son, Roman.
00:00:09 Both are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:11 They were cruelly and inhumanely sentenced
00:00:13 to two and six years in prison, respectively.
00:00:16 There is no way that it can be said that they committed any crime.
00:00:20 They were just practicing their religion.
00:00:22 Following the verdict,
00:00:23 they were immediately taken into custody from the courtroom.
00:00:26 Sadly, three months later, the appeal court upheld the unjust verdict.
00:00:35 Soon, Valentina will be transferred to prison for two years
00:00:38 and her son, Roman, for six years.
00:00:40 When the ruling was announced,
00:00:42 someone was crying quietly
00:00:44 because it was impossible to accept this without tears.
00:00:49 It lies outside the realm of human reason
00:00:52 that they could possibly be “extremists.”
00:00:54 Why did they imprison such an old and sick woman
00:00:58 and for that long?
00:01:01 Her sentence is the first one in modern-day Russia
00:01:04 where a court has convicted and imprisoned
00:01:06 a female Witness for her faith —and a 70-year-old at that.
00:01:10 She is also the first Witness
00:01:12 to be imprisoned for participating in,
00:01:14 not organizing, a banned organization.
00:01:17 Prior to this, Jehovah’s Witnesses who were accused
00:01:19 of violating this article were fined or given
00:01:22 a suspended prison sentence.
00:01:24 The main grounds for prosecuting Valentina and her son
00:01:28 are once again the Supreme Court decision,
00:01:31 which I would call egregious,
00:01:34 that was handed down on April 20, 2017.
00:01:38 On page 32 of the decision,
00:01:40 the Supreme Court specifically noted
00:01:42 that the ruling did not interfere with or violate the rights of citizens
00:01:47 to meet together or worship freely.
00:01:50 Nevertheless, the courts of the Russian Federation
00:01:53 who are using this decision
00:01:55 are totally ignoring the language in that section.
00:02:00 The charges were based on the evidence of one woman
00:02:04 who, pretending to want to study the Bible, recorded everything on camera
00:02:08 —all their discussions— and handed it over to the FSB.
00:02:13 The criminal case against Valentina and Roman
00:02:15 was initiated in April 2019.
00:02:18 Their home was subsequently searched.
00:02:20 Then in July 2020, because of being under constant stress,
00:02:24 Valentina suffered a stroke.
00:02:27 She was hospitalized, and then they discovered
00:02:30 that she had heart problems as well.
00:02:32 But despite those circumstances,
00:02:34 the court still decided that she needed
00:02:36 to be imprisoned and isolated from society.
00:02:41 Sometimes they had to call an ambulance five or six times a week
00:02:44 because her blood pressure would skyrocket
00:02:48 and she would have problems with her heart.
00:02:51 Despite Valentina’s health problems and advanced age,
00:02:53 the detention authorities forced her to wash the floor of her cell.
00:02:57 According to their friends, Valentina and Roman
00:03:00 are managing to stay positive
00:03:02 despite being imprisoned and separated.
00:03:05 In letters, Valentina relates that she eagerly awaits
00:03:07 the time when they will be released and reunited.
00:03:11 Roman is very worried about his mother.
00:03:14 I know that for now,
00:03:16 while they are still in the pretrial detention facility,
00:03:19 they are allowed to write to each other.
00:03:22 The Baranovskiys handled this persecution
00:03:24 in a praiseworthy manner.
00:03:27 They never panicked.
00:03:29 They remained calm and viewed it as something to be expected
00:03:32 and what every Christian should be ready for.
00:03:35 Every time I met Valentina,
00:03:37 I never heard her express any negative sentiments
00:03:41 with regard to her persecutors.
00:03:43 She understands
00:03:45 what is happening and why it is happening.
00:03:49 But she will not renounce her faith just to make life easier,
00:03:54 although she was given the opportunity to do so
00:03:56 in the course of the investigation.
00:04:00 Even this shameful and inhumane verdict did not frighten
00:04:04 Valentina and Roman.
00:04:06 They remain loyal to their faith.
00:04:09 Their friends hope that justice will soon be restored
00:04:12 and that this elderly mother and her son
00:04:14 will once again enjoy freedom.

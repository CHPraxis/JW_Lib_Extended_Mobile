00:00:01 We’d like to welcome all of you to JW Broadcasting®
00:00:05 for February 2021!
00:00:27 In Parts 1 and 2 of the annual meeting,
00:00:30 we enjoyed encouraging announcements,
00:00:33 videos, talks, and interviews.
00:00:37 Now we’ll enjoy the final part of the annual meeting.
00:00:42 Please pay close attention as we begin with a talk
00:00:46 by Brother Kenneth Cook entitled
00:00:49 “Will You Keep Standing Among the Righteous?”
00:00:54 We live in a time of judgment.
00:00:57 We’re not talking about flawed human judgment.
00:01:00 We’re talking about the perfect judgment
00:01:02 that comes from the heavenly Kingdom
00:01:04 in Jesus’ hands.
00:01:07 Jesus spoke of this judgment in his great prophecy
00:01:10 about the “last days” found in Matthew chapters 24 and 25.
00:01:15 After outlining what we could expect to see,
00:01:18 he provided three parables that deal with final judgment.
00:01:23 In Matthew chapter 25,
00:01:25 the first two parables relate to the final sealing
00:01:29 of genuine anointed ones.
00:01:31 These parables will be fulfilled
00:01:33 not long before the great tribulation begins.
00:01:36 Next, in the third parable,
00:01:39 Jesus gives attention to the rest of mankind.
00:01:42 Let’s read the opening four verses
00:01:45 of what he said starting in verse 31:
00:01:50 “When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him,
00:01:54 “then he will sit down on his glorious throne.
00:01:57 “All the nations will be gathered before him,
00:02:00 “and he will separate people one from another,
00:02:03 “just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
00:02:07 “And he will put the sheep on his right hand,
00:02:10 “but the goats on his left.
00:02:12 “Then the King will say to those on his right:
00:02:16 “‘Come, you who have been blessed by my Father,
00:02:19 “‘inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
00:02:22 from the founding of the world.’”
00:02:25 “Inherit the Kingdom,”
00:02:27 in other words, Paradise,
00:02:30 the earthly realm of the Kingdom.
00:02:32 When is this fulfilled?
00:02:34 After Jesus comes in his glory, he said,
00:02:38 and judges those then living.
00:02:40 Jesus said that this judgment would result
00:02:43 in a figurative separating of people
00:02:46 to his right hand and to his left hand,
00:02:49 like separating sheep from goats.
00:02:52 Jesus calls those at his right hand “righteous.”
00:02:56 However, he calls those separated to his left hand “cursed,”
00:03:00 and he sends them off into everlasting destruction.
00:03:04 Since the first two parables
00:03:06 involve judgment that takes place
00:03:09 before the great tribulation,
00:03:11 what about this third parable?
00:03:14 When does Jesus start to identify the righteous sheep
00:03:18 and the cursed goats?
00:03:21 Back in 1995, The Watchtower  helped us to understand
00:03:25 that the final judgment of the sheep and the goats will be decided
00:03:29 when Jesus comes in his glory during the great tribulation.
00:03:33 Does this mean that the judgment process does not start until then?
00:03:38 The answer is no.
00:03:40 Why can we say this?
00:03:42 Well, let’s illustrate the point.
00:03:44 Think about judgments delivered by a Supreme Court.
00:03:48 When the day arrives for a judgment to be announced,
00:03:51 does this mean that only then the court
00:03:54 starts to consider the evidence at hand?
00:03:56 No.
00:03:58 By that time, the court has already read briefs,
00:04:00 they have prepared and heard oral arguments,
00:04:04 and then they consider the legal background to the case.
00:04:08 This may take considerable time.
00:04:11 No court opinion is considered final
00:04:14 until it is delivered in open court
00:04:16 or released to the public.
00:04:18 What is the point?
00:04:20 Well, if the Supreme Courts of human governments
00:04:23 take time to hear all the facts
00:04:25 and to weigh all the circumstances,
00:04:27 should we be surprised that Jesus
00:04:29 is wisely using his time now
00:04:32 to judge people fairly?
00:04:34 By the start of the great tribulation,
00:04:37 Jesus will know who is goatlike and who is sheeplike.
00:04:40 How so?
00:04:42 Well, consider this: To a degree, even we can see
00:04:45 where people are choosing to stand.
00:04:47 True, the Bible foretold that this would be the case
00:04:51 in Malachi chapter 3.
00:04:54 There we find prophetic words that point ahead
00:04:56 to events in the first century
00:04:59 and in modern times.
00:05:01 Then verse 18 says that we would
00:05:04 “see the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person,
00:05:08 “between one serving God
00:05:10 and one not serving him.”
00:05:13 If we can see the distinction,
00:05:15 then we can be certain that Jesus is far ahead of us.
00:05:19 What does Jesus see?
00:05:22 Well, we can be sure that he’s carefully watching
00:05:25 the attitudes, actions, and speech of each person.
00:05:30 For example, he sees their response to the good news.
00:05:34 Also, Jesus is observing
00:05:37 whether individuals support his anointed brothers
00:05:40 who will serve with him in the Kingdom.
00:05:42 At Matthew 25:35-40,
00:05:46 Jesus said that his brothers would experience many trials.
00:05:51 And he explained that those whom he judges as sheep
00:05:55 are the ones who assist his brothers.
00:05:58 He also said that he views what is done to them
00:06:02 as being done to him.
00:06:06 While Christ’s brothers will undoubtedly face
00:06:08 trials during the great tribulation,
00:06:10 how are they helped now?
00:06:13 Doing good to Christ’s brothers now
00:06:15 includes working along with them as they strive
00:06:18 to complete the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom.
00:06:22 Jesus takes note of this.
00:06:25 What else does Jesus observe?
00:06:28 At Matthew 12:36, 37,
00:06:32 Jesus stated that a person’s words would also be a basis
00:06:36 for how he or she is judged.
00:06:39 Let’s look at what Jesus said
00:06:41 at Matthew 12:36, 37.
00:06:46 Jesus said: “I tell you that men will render an account on Judgment Day
00:06:51 “for every unprofitable saying that they speak;
00:06:55 “for by your words you will be declared righteous,
00:06:58 and by your words you will be condemned.”
00:07:03 So then, does Jesus hear what we say?
00:07:06 Yes, he does,
00:07:08 including what we have said in preaching the good news.
00:07:12 Now, by using the words “render an account” here,
00:07:17 Jesus was referring
00:07:19 to what a person has said in the past.
00:07:23 That thought is reinforced by the use of the past tense
00:07:26 at Matthew 25:34-40 for the sheep
00:07:34 and 41-45 for the goats.
00:07:38 For example, in verse 40, Jesus says to the sheeplike ones:
00:07:42 “To the extent that you did it [past tense]
00:07:46 “to one of the least of these my brothers,
00:07:48 you did it to me.”
00:07:51 What does this tell us?
00:07:53 It tells us that everyone who desires to be viewed as a righteous sheep
00:07:57 must build up a good record of support for Christ’s brothers—now!
00:08:02 A person must be sheeplike when entering the great tribulation,
00:08:06 and they must remain sheeplike to the very end.
00:08:10 By the time “the Son of man comes in his glory,”
00:08:13 it will be far too late to build up such a good record with him.
00:08:18 Jesus is like the king mentioned
00:08:21 at Proverbs 20:8.
00:08:24 There it says:
00:08:26 “When the king sits on the throne to judge,
00:08:29 he sifts out all evil with his eyes.”
00:08:33 In line with this, we can be certain that Jesus, our heavenly King,
00:08:38 is already sifting and taking note
00:08:40 of who are goatlike in their attitudes, actions, and speech.
00:08:45 For those who continue refusing to serve Jehovah and his Kingdom,
00:08:50 their judgment will be in place as the great tribulation begins.
00:08:54 We can say this because there are no Scriptural indications
00:08:58 of any conversions to pure worship during the great tribulation.
00:09:03 Instead, we read at Revelation 6:16, 17
00:09:08 that those who chose not to obey the good news
00:09:11 will at that time turn to man-made things to try to save them.
00:09:15 They will run to things that they view as mountainlike, or strong,
00:09:20 such as their political and commercial systems.
00:09:23 Revelation 6:16 tells us
00:09:25 that they will cry out to such things saying:
00:09:28 “Fall over us and hide us from the face
00:09:31 “of the One seated on the throne
00:09:33 and from the wrath of the Lamb.”
00:09:36 But these human institutions will have no power to save them.
00:09:41 What will this mean for such ones?
00:09:43 Many goatlike ones will perish
00:09:46 early in the great tribulation
00:09:48 when the governments of this world turn on and destroy false religion.
00:09:53 Many more will perish at the hands of other goatlike people.
00:09:57 Ezekiel 38:21 prophetically states
00:10:00 that “every man’s sword
00:10:03 will be against his own brother.”
00:10:05 Finally, all remaining goatlike ones
00:10:08 will perish by means of the angelic forces at Armageddon.
00:10:14 But as for the sheeplike ones,
00:10:16 the Fine Shepherd, Jesus,
00:10:19 will know each one of them before the start of the great tribulation,
00:10:23 and he will observe their loyalty to Jehovah
00:10:26 throughout the great tribulation.
00:10:28 Then, just before Armageddon begins,
00:10:32 Jesus will, in effect, sit down as judge to make the final distinction
00:10:37 between the sheep and the goats out of all people then living.
00:10:42 Notably, in this third parable,
00:10:45 Jesus said that those who were at that time judged as goats
00:10:49 will call him Lord.
00:10:51 But Jesus will make it clear
00:10:53 that they did not support his brothers.
00:10:57 So, then, any persons who were once sheeplike
00:11:00 but who failed to endure to the end
00:11:03 by courageously supporting Christ’s brothers
00:11:05 will be placed among the goats.
00:11:08 Referring to Jesus as Lord will not save them.
00:11:12 It will be too late to do good for Christ’s brothers
00:11:15 who will likely be with Jesus in the heavenly Kingdom by that time.
00:11:20 Of course, the goats will also include those enemies of God
00:11:23 who are still alive out of all the nations.
00:11:27 This final judging serves an important purpose.
00:11:30 What is it?
00:11:32 It will leave no doubt in the eyes of all then living
00:11:35 as to who Jesus’ righteous sheep are
00:11:38 as they prepare to enter the new world.
00:11:42 So, then, strive to keep standing among the righteous
00:11:46 who will be placed at Jesus’ right hand.
00:11:49 God’s Word promises that as long as sheeplike ones remain loyal to Him
00:11:54 and to his appointed King, Jesus,
00:11:57 they will be guided into everlasting life.
00:12:00 Such ones must display courage
00:12:03 by supporting the work of Christ’s brothers,
00:12:05 both now and during the great tribulation.
00:12:09 What kind of courage will be needed?
00:12:12 Courage like that of Onesiphorus.
00:12:16 The apostle Paul mentions this faithful Christian
00:12:19 at 2 Timothy 1:16-18.
00:12:23 We invite you to read what he said about him,
00:12:25 starting in verse 16:
00:12:28 “May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus,
00:12:33 “for he often refreshed me,
00:12:35 “and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains.
00:12:39 “On the contrary, when he was in Rome,
00:12:42 “he diligently looked for me and found me.
00:12:44 “May the Lord grant him to find mercy
00:12:47 from Jehovah in that day.”
00:12:52 Onesiphorus would have been an anointed Christian,
00:12:56 but his example is one for every Christian to imitate.
00:13:00 Just visiting Paul could have cost Onesiphorus
00:13:03 his freedom or his life.
00:13:05 But that did not stop him from finding Paul
00:13:09 and refreshing him, did it?
00:13:11 Qualities such as Onesiphoruslike courage
00:13:14 will be required of all sheeplike ones
00:13:17 during the great tribulation.
00:13:20 So in summary, Jesus is now observing
00:13:23 the actions, attitudes, and speech of all people.
00:13:27 As a thorough Judge,
00:13:29 he will have identified sheeplike ones and goatlike ones
00:13:33 by the start of the great tribulation.
00:13:35 Then, according to Jesus’ parable,
00:13:38 just before Armageddon begins,
00:13:41 Jesus will pass final judgment on all then living on earth,
00:13:46 giving attention to why the righteous sheep
00:13:49 are placed at his right hand.
00:13:51 Will you be found standing among the righteous?
00:13:55 To receive that blessing, don’t be swayed by the things
00:13:58 you see taking place around you in this world.
00:14:01 Don’t be swayed by popular protests.
00:14:04 Remain neutral—no part of it.
00:14:07 Don’t be swayed by political promises.
00:14:10 Remain neutral—no part of it.
00:14:13 Don’t be swayed as governments say, “Peace and security!”
00:14:17 Remain neutral—no part of it.
00:14:20 But when it comes to obeying God’s laws,
00:14:23 stand firmly on the side of the Kingdom.
00:14:27 Only those who remain no part of the world
00:14:30 will be viewed by Jesus as being sheeplike
00:14:33 when the great tribulation begins
00:14:35 and when it wraps up at Armageddon.
00:14:39 And only those who continue to support Jesus’ brothers
00:14:42 will be placed at Jesus’ right hand
00:14:45 when he makes the final judgment
00:14:47 of the righteous sheep and the cursed goats.
00:14:50 Show where you desire to stand
00:14:53 in all that you say and do right now.
00:14:56 And during the time yet remaining,
00:14:58 get ready to use our new publication Enjoy Life Forever!
00:15:03 and help many more take a righteous stand
00:15:07 before the end comes.
00:15:11 Thank you, Brother Cook, for making clear
00:15:14 that what a person does now to support Jehovah’s arrangement
00:15:18 is crucial in Christ’s final judgment of the sheep
00:15:21 and goats just before Armageddon.
00:15:25 May all of us choose to support true worship now
00:15:28 and on through the great tribulation yet to come!
00:15:34 Now we are happy to share with you a video
00:15:37 about an upcoming video series.
00:15:40 Brother Stephen Lett is the host of this presentation.
00:15:43 You will be delighted with what he has to say.
00:15:49 Jesus said as recorded at Matthew 11:27:
00:15:53 “No one fully knows . . .
00:15:55 “the Father except the Son
00:15:59 and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”
00:16:04 This teaches us two things.
00:16:07 First, that it is possible
00:16:10 for us to know the Father fully,
00:16:13 and second, that Jesus is the key to knowing Jehovah.
00:16:19 Jesus clearly identified his role
00:16:23 in revealing the Father.
00:16:25 On his last night here on earth,
00:16:28 he told his apostles
00:16:30 as recorded at John 14:6:
00:16:33 “I am the way and the truth and the life.
00:16:38 No one comes to the Father except through me.”
00:16:44 Only through Jesus can we truly know the Father
00:16:48 and have an approved relationship with Him.
00:16:52 Earlier, at the transfiguration,
00:16:55 Jehovah confirmed Jesus’ pivotal role
00:16:59 when he instructed Peter, James, and John
00:17:02 to listen to Jesus.
00:17:05 For over a century, “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:17:10 has provided a wide range of study aids
00:17:13 to help us learn about the life, ministry,
00:17:17 and teachings of Jesus Christ.
00:17:20 These gifts enrich our study of God’s Word.
00:17:23 They shed light on the world he lived in,
00:17:28 the places he walked,
00:17:31 the towns where he preached,
00:17:35 the landscapes he saw,
00:17:38 the food he ate,
00:17:41 and even the seasons
00:17:43 in which various events took place.
00:17:47 These printed publications
00:17:49 are more than just words on a page.
00:17:52 They illuminate Jesus’ personality
00:17:55 and reveal his qualities,
00:17:57 which mirror those of his heavenly Father.
00:18:01 We learn about Jesus’ compassion,
00:18:04 self-sacrifice,
00:18:06 humility, power,
00:18:09 boldness, courage,
00:18:12 and love.
00:18:14 More important,
00:18:16 focusing on Jesus’ teachings and example
00:18:20 draw us closer to the One who sent him.
00:18:24 Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions
00:18:26 also deepen our love and appreciation
00:18:29 for God’s Son.
00:18:31 In more recent years,
00:18:33 Jehovah’s organization has used videos
00:18:36 to reach the hearts
00:18:38 of all those attending our conventions.
00:18:42 But how can we continue to help honest-hearted ones
00:18:46 to understand Jesus’ role as King and High Priest
00:18:51 and to help them acquire “the mind of Christ”?
00:18:56 Well, bringing events of Jesus’ ministry
00:18:59 to life on screen or on the printed page
00:19:03 is not without its challenges.
00:19:08 As you know,
00:19:10 the Governing Body had those full-costume dramas
00:19:12 for years at conventions,
00:19:15 but never was Jesus depicted.
00:19:18 And you can understand the challenge.
00:19:20 Who’s going to play Jesus?
00:19:23 Can you imagine trying to select brothers in say
00:19:27 200-300 (or even more) different places
00:19:32 to play the role of Jesus Christ?
00:19:35 But then finally,
00:19:36 ‘For a Certainty God Made Him  Lord and Christ’ (Part I, Part II)
00:19:40 —we went ahead,  and the Governing Body approved it:
00:19:42 “Go ahead. Let’s have that.”
00:19:44 And it worked very well.
00:19:46 When you see Jesus  with the woman that had a flow of blood
00:19:50 and the tenderness shown in our video of Jesus dealing with that woman
00:19:54 and her fear and yet her confidence
00:19:58 that she could be healed by him and the way Jesus treated her,
00:20:02 that conveyed something that we would not always bring up
00:20:05 in our imagination.
00:20:08 So once we saw the reaction from the brothers and sisters
00:20:11 —how their hearts were touched by this presentation—
00:20:14 we could see that this is a very effective way
00:20:17 to portray Jesus’ teachings.
00:20:19 What could boost your spirituality more
00:20:22 than actually seeing the Scriptures come alive?
00:20:27 Now here is a very exciting announcement:
00:20:31 The Governing Body is pleased to announce
00:20:36 that a very special video series about Jesus
00:20:40 is currently being developed.
00:20:43 Work is under way to develop and produce
00:20:46 a new, live-action dramatic series
00:20:50 on Jesus Christ.
00:20:52 The title of the series is
00:20:55 The Good News According to Jesus.
00:21:00 This series will combine the strengths
00:21:03 of all our preceding research and study tools
00:21:07 with the power of the moving image
00:21:11 and will enable the viewer to gain an even deeper understanding
00:21:16 of Jesus’ life and ministry,
00:21:19 which in turn increases our knowledge of Jehovah.
00:21:24 Although other religious and commercial institutions
00:21:27 have produced various films on the life of Jesus,
00:21:31 these have often been tainted by unscriptural views of Jesus,
00:21:36 or they have placed excessive emphasis
00:21:40 on violence.
00:21:42 And existing video productions
00:21:45 focus on one Bible book at a time
00:21:48 or only on specific episodes of Jesus’ ministry on earth.
00:21:54 The Good News According to Jesus,
00:21:56 however, will show all the events
00:21:59 of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
00:22:02 in the order in which they happened
00:22:05 and in as much of the rich detail
00:22:08 as current research and Bible understanding will allow.
00:22:14 Often, a presentation like the one you are about to see
00:22:18 is shown after a feature-length drama is released.
00:22:22 Such behind-the-scenes videos
00:22:25 help us to understand and appreciate
00:22:27 various facets of the video-making process.
00:22:32 Today, however, we are giving you a preview
00:22:37 —a first look—
00:22:39 at an upcoming convention project
00:22:41 that will take years to complete.
00:22:44 In view of the large scope of this project,
00:22:48 we encourage you
00:22:50 to make it a matter of earnest prayer to Jehovah
00:22:53 and please support it
00:22:57 according to your circumstances.
00:23:00 Would you like see what Episode One might look like?
00:23:07 To provide an advance impression of the look and feel of an episode,
00:23:11 Audio/Video Services prepares storyboards.
00:23:16 We’re pleased to share with you now
00:23:19 an excerpt from an animated storyboard.
00:23:37 Assuming that he was
00:23:39 in the group traveling together,
00:23:41 they went a day’s journey
00:23:42 and then began to search for him
00:23:44 among the relatives and acquaintances.
00:23:52 But not finding him,
00:23:54 they returned to Jerusalem
00:23:56 and made a diligent search for him.
00:24:19 Well, after three days,
00:24:22 they found him in the temple,
00:24:25 sitting in the midst of the teachers
00:24:27 and listening to them
00:24:28 and asking them questions.
00:24:33 But all those listening to him
00:24:36 were in constant amazement
00:24:38 at his understanding and his answers.
00:24:42 Now when his parents saw him,
00:24:44 they were astounded.
00:24:54 Child, why did you treat us this way?
00:24:58 Here your father and I
00:25:00 have been frantically looking for you.
00:25:04 Why were you looking for me?
00:25:06 Did you not know that I must be
00:25:08 in the house of my Father?
00:25:11 However, they did not understand
00:25:13 what he was saying to them.
00:25:15 Then he went down with them
00:25:17 and returned to Nazareth,
00:25:18 and he continued subject to them.
00:25:21 Also, his mother carefully kept
00:25:23 all these sayings in her heart.
00:25:34 And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom
00:25:37 and in physical growth
00:25:40 and in favor with God and men.
00:25:45 The true light that gives light
00:25:48 to every sort of man
00:25:50 was about to come into the world.
00:25:56 Of course, this is not the final video.
00:25:59 Rather, it’s an example
00:26:02 of how the words on a page can come to life.
00:26:07 Preparing simple, basic drawings
00:26:10 to convey the idea of a video
00:26:12 is one of the early visual tools used
00:26:16 during the approval process.
00:26:18 The animatic review is a very early milestone
00:26:23 for the visual storytelling.
00:26:26 But how has the project been developed?
00:26:30 What direction has the Governing Body given
00:26:33 for bringing events in Jesus’ life to the screen?
00:26:38 So first of all, the Governing Body approved the concept
00:26:42 of producing a production like this.
00:26:45 But there were some questions, such as,
00:26:47 How do you do it?
00:26:49 So three options were given to the Governing Body.
00:26:52 The first option
00:26:54 was for us just to have a theatrical stage production
00:26:58 similar to what we’d already done.
00:27:01 The second set of options involved
00:27:05 having a narrator speaking
00:27:08 and just reading the sections of Scripture
00:27:11 and in the background to have acting
00:27:13 but not actually having Jesus speaking
00:27:16 or those involved with Jesus speaking.
00:27:19 And then finally, the third option
00:27:22 —which is, of course, the hardest and involves a lot of work—
00:27:26 is to do a real-life drama.
00:27:30 So we were interested to see
00:27:32 how the Governing Body would feel about this.
00:27:34 And what a joyous time it was to hear the brothers say:
00:27:37 “We want the best for the brotherhood.
00:27:40 “We want them to be able to see
00:27:42 “the power and impact of what Jesus taught.
00:27:46 Yes, we want the third option!”
00:27:48 So then we realized that there’s a lot of work ahead.
00:27:52 It’s easy to think: ‘The inspired text is there.
00:27:56 What’s to write?’
00:27:58 But it’s not as simple as just taking little, half-hour chunks
00:28:01 out of the four Gospel accounts
00:28:03 and throwing them on a script and filming them.
00:28:07 Which Gospel account do you use?
00:28:09 Do you use Matthew’s account? Mark’s? Luke’s?
00:28:12 So, very quickly we saw the need to lay each
00:28:15 of the four Gospel accounts side by side
00:28:19 and decide which account
00:28:22 —in every case, every event—
00:28:24 gives us the fullest picture, the most details.
00:28:27 So even if you can’t say everything that appears in all four accounts,
00:28:32 you use the one to carry the bulk of the story,
00:28:35 and the others provide the rest of the details
00:28:38 that we’ll actually see.
00:28:40 The brothers who help write the dramas
00:28:43 have a tremendous amount of work to do.
00:28:45 But then there are also those who do the research
00:28:48 just to make sure little details are correct,
00:28:51 whether it be the shoes a person has on
00:28:53 or whether he even wears shoes.
00:28:55 When you show something on film,
00:28:58 you are committing yourself.
00:29:00 You are saying that this is the explanation
00:29:04 or, in some cases, the application.
00:29:07 It goes beyond illustration; it’s the explanation.
00:29:10 It’s the way to understand what happened.
00:29:12 And that is what sticks with people’s memories.
00:29:14 So it’s a huge responsibility to get that right.
00:29:18 So our Research Department already has a lot of information.
00:29:22 But doing something like this is yet another step
00:29:26 down the path of being very, very difficult
00:29:29 because there are a lot more questions that come up.
00:29:32 How are we going to depict the Devil?
00:29:34 How do you show Jesus walking on water?
00:29:36 What footwear was allowed in the Soreg?
00:29:39 And what’s a Soreg?
00:29:41 Research is pivotal in this.
00:29:44 So you make a decision about what to depict.
00:29:49 But then there are details when it comes
00:29:52 to not just telling it, not just reading what happened,
00:29:56 but now you have to show what happened.
00:29:59 How do you do that?
00:30:01 If you take something that’s static, like a piece of artwork
00:30:04 that’s well-researched with solid sources,
00:30:06 and now bring it to life, then in many respects,
00:30:10 more research needs to go into this
00:30:12 so that everything is looked at from various angles.
00:30:17 So let me explain the challenge we have with John chapter 6.
00:30:20 If we look at Map 3B in the Appendix section,
00:30:23 just imagine we have the Sea of Galilee here.
00:30:27 Now, according to what it shows us,
00:30:29 we have Magadan here on this side
00:30:31 of the Sea of Galilee,
00:30:34 and up here we have Capernaum.
00:30:37 Now, according to what this tells us,
00:30:40 Jesus performed his miracle
00:30:42 across on this side of the Sea of Galilee,
00:30:45 and then the apostles traveled by boat
00:30:48 to this general area.
00:30:50 Of course, Jesus joined up with them when he walked on the water.
00:30:53 So according to John chapter 6,
00:30:56 Jesus starts to teach the crowd
00:30:58 as he is walking along the seashore.
00:31:01 But by the end of John chapter 6,
00:31:04 we see that Jesus is actually speaking at that time
00:31:08 here in Capernaum.
00:31:10 So the question comes up,
00:31:12 What part of the dialogue
00:31:14 was actually stated here in the synagogue in Capernaum,
00:31:17 and what part was stated
00:31:19 along the seashore as he was walking along?
00:31:22 So we’ll have to do some research into John chapter 6
00:31:26 and see where there is a good break
00:31:28 for us to realize what words
00:31:30 were actually said there in the synagogue.
00:31:32 That’s the challenge.
00:31:34 We need for the friends to be able to watch this video series
00:31:38 and feel they’re actually there.
00:31:40 And what they are seeing is as close to the way
00:31:43 it must have been as we can possibly make it.
00:31:45 And the role of research helps us to ensure that.
00:31:49 With scripts being developed and approved,
00:31:52 the production team continues work
00:31:55 with the visual look and feel of the series.
00:31:59 So when we found out that the project involved
00:32:01 the entirety of Jesus’ ministry,
00:32:03 it was simply overwhelming.
00:32:05 Once we’ve read our script, we go into a phase
00:32:07 where we start working with storyboards.
00:32:10 Storyboards are kind of like a first pass
00:32:13 at what this story might look like.
00:32:16 That’s compiled into what’s called an animatic,
00:32:19 which is a type of video.
00:32:21 So you’ve got a narration,
00:32:23 you’ve got dialogue, and you’ve got music,
00:32:25 but it’s to these cartoon boards.
00:32:27 It’s great because it gets you prepared
00:32:30 so that on set, the challenges don’t just pop up.
00:32:32 You can anticipate them.
00:32:36 Concept art is a communication tool
00:32:38 to help us to get all on the same page.
00:32:42 Concept art helps us to get the mood of it, the lighting,
00:32:47 and to experience it maybe from a perspective
00:32:49 that we hadn’t thought of before.
00:32:52 The story of Jesus’ ministry isn’t just dry, cold facts.
00:32:56 It’s actually human stories.
00:32:58 When we see how different people responded and reacted to Jesus’ ministry
00:33:03 —how they were shaped  and molded by what they experienced—
00:33:05 that’s essentially that character’s arc.
00:33:07 We go in and say:
00:33:09 “OK, where does our character start? How does he grow?
00:33:12 And where is he by the end of this series?”
00:33:17 By seeing his struggles, seeing his challenges,
00:33:19 it makes that character more relatable.
00:33:22 As years of development passed,
00:33:25 the immense scope of this project came into clear focus.
00:33:30 A natural question arose,
00:33:32 Where would we record it?
00:33:36 When we were doing the production of Jonah,
00:33:38 we used parts of southern California.
00:33:40 And we thought that would be a very good location.
00:33:42 So that was proposed to the Governing Body,
00:33:45 and they said, “Thank you very much,
00:33:48 “but we would rather that you use existing Bethel facilities
00:33:52 “that would be available
00:33:53 and that maybe are not being utilized to their full potential.”
00:33:57 We worked with Worldwide Design/Construction,
00:34:00 and they provided a list of some of the branches that had space.
00:34:04 And as we were doing so, it came to our attention
00:34:07 that in Australasia, the printery was about to be phased out.
00:34:13 At the end of 2015,
00:34:16 the printing work was moved to Japan.
00:34:18 The press was then put up for sale.
00:34:20 It sold about three years later.
00:34:22 So now we had this big warehouse space
00:34:24 —just what we needed for a studio.
00:34:28 We were just stunned
00:34:29 to think that such a project could be accomplished here.
00:34:33 But I think we’ve also seen so much evidence
00:34:36 of Jehovah’s blessing on this project
00:34:38 that it’s very clear it’s something he wants.
00:34:41 The temporary accommodations here at the branch
00:34:44 were due for demolition,
00:34:46 and, I mean, like the bulldozers were almost at the gate.
00:34:49 So we were able to stop those bulldozers
00:34:52 and, as a result, we’re currently renovating those residences.
00:34:56 Jehovah’s hand was definitely in that experience.
00:34:58 Without the stopping of that demolition,
00:35:01 we wouldn’t have had enough accommodations  to look after this project.
00:35:06 It was as if Jehovah was dropping this option in our laps
00:35:09 with all the criteria that we needed to do this project.
00:35:13 With the primary location selected,
00:35:16 Production Design helps take a concept
00:35:20 and make it a reality.
00:35:24 Our goal as Production Design is to immerse the audience in the story.
00:35:28 If they have that sense, now they’re paying attention
00:35:32 to what’s being said on screen
00:35:35 —what they can learn, what they can benefit from it.
00:35:39 It’s one thing to design something,
00:35:41 but then to execute that design is another thing.
00:35:44 Even like with the throne room,
00:35:46 this actually is too much work.
00:35:48 We have to simplify it.
00:35:50 Do we need to show three walls?
00:35:52 Can we just get away with building two walls
00:35:54 and have the same effect, the same production quality?
00:35:58 Usually, we design the set, we build a set,
00:36:02 we film the set, and then we tear the set down.
00:36:05 But this project is unique in that we’re not doing that.
00:36:08 These buildings, these structures,
00:36:10 that we’re going to be filming are going to last for years,
00:36:13 and so they had to be built that way.
00:36:16 So how do we combine modern-day building standards to make it last
00:36:21 but still make it look like an old, ancient, building
00:36:24 that was built 2,000 years ago?
00:36:27 We were looking for a certain type of finish —a concrete finish.
00:36:30 Through a website, we found there was a company
00:36:33 over in Perth that was able to achieve this.
00:36:37 And after calling them, we found out they’re brothers.
00:36:41 And those brothers have been able to come over and help us
00:36:43 with their expertise to get the right type of finish.
00:36:47 The support from all those under the Australasia branch territory
00:36:51 has been faith-strengthening.
00:36:55 So one of the biggest needs we probably have at the moment
00:36:57 would be auditioning.
00:36:59 We absolutely need more volunteers for acting.
00:37:03 It’s a unique and new form of sacred service.
00:37:05 It’s something that probably most never thought they would ever do
00:37:09 or be asked to do, but there is definitely a need.
00:37:12 The more that can make themselves available  through this auditioning process
00:37:16 would allow us to have the right people in the roles.
00:37:19 One fundamental principle that underlies
00:37:21 any good acting is empathy.
00:37:24 It’s something that we all learn as Christians.
00:37:25 It’s not about showing the behavior in big ways.
00:37:29 It’s about understanding who the character is,
00:37:31 and then it exudes naturally.
00:37:33 Jehovah’s organization will always train us,
00:37:35 and Jehovah’s spirit will make us ready
00:37:38 for the task that’s ahead of us.
00:37:40 It’s simple training,
00:37:41 but it’s definitely designed to help somebody
00:37:44 to get comfortable in front of a camera,
00:37:47 performing in front of many people
00:37:49 and being able to relax —being able to be themselves.
00:37:52 To see our brothers and sisters offering themselves,
00:37:54 putting themselves out in this way,
00:37:56 is wonderful.
00:38:01 When this project was first discussed,
00:38:03 it felt like it was so far into the future
00:38:06 and almost an impossibility.
00:38:07 It was so big in scope.
00:38:09 But now, it’s actually happening
00:38:12 and you see Jehovah’s blessing on the planning, on the construction,
00:38:16 on the people.
00:38:21 Will there be challenges?
00:38:22 Oh yeah, guaranteed.
00:38:24 But if Jehovah wants something done, that’s what happens.
00:38:28 We have things at the right time,
00:38:30 and that’s what we’ve done.
00:38:32 We’ve advanced now to where we’re able to do it
00:38:34 in such a wonderful way for the whole world.
00:38:36 We are working with the best words
00:38:39 that have ever been spoken on this planet
00:38:42 —words that have power and meaning.
00:38:45 This is such a huge endeavor,
00:38:48 and yet Jehovah has shown us his direction all along.
00:38:52 It needs to be done.
00:38:54 With this project being blessed by Jehovah, that’s what’s going to happen.
00:38:58 The genuine good news according to Jesus
00:39:02 —that’s what we’re going to have.
00:39:06 It’s clear that Jehovah is blessing
00:39:10 this tremendous undertaking.
00:39:13 The Good News According to Jesus
00:39:16 will help all of us to teach the truth about Jesus,
00:39:20 and it will help us to deepen our own appreciation
00:39:24 for his loving sacrifice in behalf of all mankind.
00:39:28 Jesus said as recorded at John 14:13, 14:
00:39:35 “Whatever you ask in my name,
00:39:38 “I will do this,
00:39:40 “so that the Father may be glorified
00:39:42 “in connection with the Son.
00:39:44 “If you ask anything in my name,
00:39:47 I will do it.”
00:39:50 Thus, our sincere prayer
00:39:53 is that this multi-year project
00:39:55 will be a grand success
00:39:58 and will result in the salvation of many more true disciples,
00:40:03 all to the praise of Jehovah’s great name.
00:40:08 Thank you all for your continued prayers and support.
00:40:12 Thank you for encouraging yet others
00:40:14 to support this project with their prayers,
00:40:17 talents, time, and assets.
00:40:20 Thank you to our dear brothers and sisters in Australasia as well
00:40:25 for your willing spirit.
00:40:27 All of us eagerly await what the future holds
00:40:32 for this good work ahead of us.
00:40:35 The prologue to the book “Come Be My Follower”  states this:
00:40:41 “Jehovah sent his only-begotten Son to the earth
00:40:45 “to give his life as a ransom. . . .
00:40:48 “In addition to dying for us,
00:40:50 “that Son showed us how to live.
00:40:54 “With each step he took,
00:40:56 “he kept his integrity
00:40:58 “and brought joy to his Father’s heart.
00:41:02 “Jesus also showed us how to be like his Father.
00:41:06 “The ways and the will of the Father
00:41:09 “found perfect expression
00:41:11 in the words and deeds of the Son.”
00:41:16 If we want to draw closer to Jehovah
00:41:20 and know him fully,
00:41:22 we must continue to learn more about his Son.
00:41:26 May this new video series
00:41:29 help us to grow in love for the Son
00:41:32 and our loving Father, Jehovah.
00:41:39 What an exciting announcement!
00:41:43 We love the Gospel accounts.
00:41:45 We love Jesus’ teachings and personality,
00:41:49 and we love Jehovah, who is the One
00:41:51 that Jesus so perfectly imitated.
00:41:54 As stated in the video,
00:41:57 the Good News According to Jesus  series
00:41:59 will take years to complete.
00:42:02 To reassure you,
00:42:04 we do have additional Bible dramas planned
00:42:07 for our upcoming regional conventions.
00:42:09 However,
00:42:11 we do not have to wait for this new video series
00:42:14 to be fully completed
00:42:16 before benefiting from the visual Gospel accounts.
00:42:21 In future convention programs,
00:42:23 we will see the various segments of the life of Jesus
00:42:27 play out each year at our convention.
00:42:30 With Jehovah’s guidance,
00:42:33 we are so well-fed spiritually.
00:42:37 Brother Mark Sanderson has an interesting talk to present at this time.
00:42:42 His theme is “Where Is Jehovah?”
00:42:48 “Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.”
00:42:52 With those words, Jehovah’s angel
00:42:55 greeted faithful Judge Gideon,
00:42:58 but his reply to those words might surprise you.
00:43:02 Would you open your Bibles?
00:43:03 Let’s read together Judges 6:13,
00:43:08 that’s Judges 6:13:
00:43:11 “At this Gideon said to him:
00:43:14 “‘Pardon me, my lord,
00:43:17 “‘but if Jehovah is with us,
00:43:19 “‘why has all of this come upon us?
00:43:23 “‘Where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us, saying,
00:43:28 “‘“Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?”
00:43:31 “‘Now Jehovah has deserted us
00:43:35 and given us into Midian’s hand.’”
00:43:39 Well, is that how you would respond
00:43:42 to an angel of Jehovah who is speaking to you?
00:43:45 Well, probably not under normal circumstances.
00:43:49 But what about in 2020?
00:43:53 This has truly been an incredible year!
00:43:57 We have faced a pandemic—
00:44:00 a pandemic that has robbed us
00:44:03 of our dear loved ones,
00:44:05 a pandemic that has caused us to face isolation,
00:44:10 to be separated from our relatives and close friends
00:44:13 so that now an epidemic of anxiety
00:44:17 has settled down across our earth.
00:44:22 At times during this year,
00:44:24 maybe you have felt like Gideon.
00:44:27 Maybe his words have been your words.
00:44:30 Well, what does that mean?
00:44:32 If you have said those things or felt those things,
00:44:35 does it mean that you’re lacking faith?
00:44:38 Does it mean that your love for Jehovah is disappearing
00:44:41 or that now you’re sort of diminishing in your relationship with God?
00:44:46 Not at all.
00:44:48 Gideon was not the only faithful servant of Jehovah
00:44:52 who expressed similar thoughts.
00:44:54 Do you remember what Habakkuk said?
00:44:56 Let’s open our Bibles.
00:44:58 Let’s read together Habakkuk chapter 1
00:45:03 and verses 2 and 3.
00:45:08 Habakkuk said: “How long, O Jehovah,
00:45:13 “must I cry for help, but you do not hear?
00:45:17 “How long must I ask for help from violence,
00:45:20 “but you do not intervene?
00:45:23 “Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?
00:45:26 “And why do you tolerate oppression?
00:45:29 “Why are destruction and violence before me?
00:45:32 And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”
00:45:37 Why? Why? Why?
00:45:42 Well, maybe those words sound a little bit familiar to you.
00:45:47 But brothers, when we feel overwhelmed
00:45:50 by our circumstances, by our grief,
00:45:54 by our anxiety,
00:45:56 there is a question that we need to ask.
00:46:00 Now, this is a question that was first recorded in the Bible
00:46:05 from the faithful prophet Elisha.
00:46:08 Now, would you read it with me?
00:46:10 It’s at 2 Kings chapter 2
00:46:13 and verse 14
00:46:15 —2 Kings 2:14.
00:46:20 It says: “Then he [Now, this is Elisha. Then he]
00:46:24 “took the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him
00:46:28 “and struck the waters and said:
00:46:31 “‘Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?’
00:46:36 “When he struck the waters,
00:46:38 “they were divided to the left and to the right,
00:46:41 so that Elisha went across.”
00:46:45 What is the question?
00:46:47 “Where is Jehovah?”
00:46:50 Now, what did Elisha mean when he asked that question?
00:46:54 Was he saying: “Where is Jehovah?
00:46:56 Why isn’t he doing something?”
00:46:58 Is that the sense of the question?
00:47:01 Not at all.
00:47:02 Elisha was looking for Jehovah.
00:47:06 He was searching for his direction.
00:47:08 He wanted to see the hand of God.
00:47:12 Well, Elisha got the answer to his prayer.
00:47:15 Those waters opened right in front of him
00:47:18 so that he could cross.
00:47:21 Well, this is not the only place where this question appears in the Bible.
00:47:25 Let’s look at another place here in Jeremiah chapter 2,
00:47:30 Jeremiah 2:5:
00:47:37 “This is what Jehovah says:
00:47:39 “‘What fault did your forefathers find in me,
00:47:43 “‘so that they strayed so far from me,
00:47:46 “‘and they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves?
00:47:51 “‘They did not ask, [now notice, they did not ask]
00:47:55 “‘“Where is Jehovah,
00:47:57 “‘“the One who brought us out of the land of Egypt,
00:48:00 “‘“who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits,
00:48:04 “‘“through a land of drought and of deep shadow,
00:48:06 “‘“through a land where no man travels
00:48:09 and where no humans dwell?”’”
00:48:13 What’s the point?
00:48:15 Jehovah wanted his people to search for him.
00:48:20 He wanted them to ask: “Where is Jehovah?”
00:48:23 —to look for his hand,
00:48:25 to seek his help and direction.
00:48:29 Well, now, brothers, why is it so urgent for us
00:48:33 during these critical times —during a pandemic—
00:48:36 to be saying, “Where is Jehovah?”
00:48:40 Because we so desperately need
00:48:44 the help, the direction, the support, the comfort
00:48:49 that come from our amazing, our wonderful God, Jehovah.
00:48:54 But now you might say: “Well, is Jehovah really going to help you?
00:48:59 “Is Jehovah really going to help me?
00:49:01 “I’m not important. I’m not significant.
00:49:03 Is Jehovah really going to be there for me?”
00:49:07 Well, look at these beautiful words
00:49:09 in the scripture in Isaiah chapter 57
00:49:13 —Isaiah chapter 57,
00:49:15 which is really a promise from our God, Jehovah.
00:49:20 Isaiah 57:15 says:
00:49:24 “For this is what the High and Lofty One says,
00:49:28 “who lives forever and whose name is holy:
00:49:33 “‘I reside in the high and holy place,
00:49:36 “‘[but now notice this]
00:49:39 “‘but also with those crushed
00:49:43 “‘and lowly in spirit,
00:49:45 “‘to revive the spirit of the lowly
00:49:48 and to revive the heart of those being crushed.’”
00:49:53 What an amazing thought!
00:49:56 Here our God, Jehovah, the Almighty who dwells in the highest heavens,
00:50:00 says that when we are crushed, when we are lowly
00:50:04 —in a figurative sense— he resides right with us.
00:50:08 How beautiful! How amazing!
00:50:11 Well, now, what does that mean?
00:50:13 What does that teach us?
00:50:14 It teaches us that we need to ask that question
00:50:17 “Where is Jehovah?” every day.
00:50:19 We need to beg Jehovah for his direction.
00:50:21 We need to beg him for his help.
00:50:24 But then we need to do something more.
00:50:28 We need to be on the lookout
00:50:30 for the hand of Jehovah.
00:50:33 When Elijah felt completely isolated,
00:50:37 when he was so discouraged, you remember, he said:
00:50:39 “I am the only one left.”
00:50:43 He just poured his heart out to Jehovah.
00:50:45 And what did Jehovah do for him?
00:50:48 Well, you remember, Jehovah allowed Elijah to see
00:50:52 a miraculous display of his power.
00:50:54 Remember, he felt that wind;
00:50:57 he felt the earthquake;
00:50:59 he felt the fire.
00:51:02 But, you know, the Bible says: “Jehovah was not in the wind.”
00:51:06 “Jehovah was not in the earthquake.”
00:51:08 “Jehovah was not in the fire.”
00:51:11 But then what came next?
00:51:14 “A calm, low voice.”
00:51:19 That was Jehovah.
00:51:23 Well, now, what do we learn from that experience?
00:51:26 Sometimes, brothers, we might be waiting
00:51:28 for some big, bold, dramatic expression of Jehovah’s hand.
00:51:34 But in reality, what do we need to do?
00:51:37 We need to turn up our “spiritual hearing aids”
00:51:41 so that we can hear
00:51:43 the “calm, low voice” of Jehovah.
00:51:48 You see, Jehovah’s answer to our prayers
00:51:51 might come in a way that we don’t expect.
00:51:54 Maybe it’s through the kind gesture or act of one of our brothers or sisters.
00:51:59 Maybe it’s through a text message, an e-mail, a phone call,
00:52:04 or some other way that our brother or sister acts
00:52:07 to show their kindness.
00:52:09 Maybe that’s Jehovah’s way
00:52:11 of giving us the help that we need.
00:52:14 That means that when we are earnestly praying,
00:52:18 when we’re earnestly seeking Jehovah’s help
00:52:21 —be attentive, be alert,
00:52:23 ask: “Where is Jehovah?”
00:52:25 and look for his hand.
00:52:28 But now here’s another question, brothers:
00:52:31 When that help comes,
00:52:33 when Jehovah does provide that assistance that you need,
00:52:37 will you be willing to accept it?
00:52:40 When Mary came to Jesus with the perfumed oil, genuine nard
00:52:45 —remember, so expensive
00:52:48 that it would cost a year’s wages for an average laborer—
00:52:53 it would have been so easy for Jesus to turn her away,
00:52:57 to just say: “Oh, no, Mary, thank you very much, but I don’t need you.
00:53:01 “Jehovah is going to help me, so you can just go now,
00:53:05 and I’ll be fine.”
00:53:07 Jesus didn’t do that.
00:53:09 Jesus willingly accepted the help.
00:53:13 Now, maybe Jesus understood
00:53:16 that Jehovah had put it into Mary’s heart to do this
00:53:19 so that his body would be properly prepared for burial.
00:53:22 We don’t know.
00:53:23 But the point is, Jesus accepted
00:53:27 the help that Mary provided.
00:53:30 Well, brothers and sisters, what’s the lesson?
00:53:33 What do we need to learn from this?
00:53:36 If you’re a person who always says,
00:53:38 “Oh, no, we’re fine; we don’t need anything;
00:53:42 Jehovah is going to help us,”
00:53:44 or, “Oh, no, you don’t need to tell me that;
00:53:46 I already know Jehovah will give me the direction I need,”
00:53:51 well, then, you may be missing out.
00:53:53 We may not be seeing or hearing
00:53:57 the help that Jehovah wants to give us.
00:54:01 Let’s watch a video and see how our brothers and sisters in distress
00:54:06 have experienced the help of Jehovah at a critical time.
00:54:13 I thought that fire was loud.
00:54:15 I thought that you could hear a wildfire,
00:54:18 and it was just dead quiet.
00:54:21 By the time we went down the driveway and around the corner,
00:54:23 we stopped and looked back
00:54:26 and the back of my parents’ house was on fire.
00:54:30 When the pandemic hit, we lost our work.
00:54:34 We couldn’t go to work, and we also couldn’t leave our apartment.
00:54:39 The situation was very hard.
00:54:42 My husband, Ivan, was charged
00:54:45 with organizing extremist activity.
00:54:47 He was put into pretrial detention
00:54:51 for four months.
00:54:52 I found out that I had a tumor in my chest
00:54:55 and I would have to have a very serious operation.
00:55:01 I lost my mom to the coronavirus.
00:55:04 Living 3,000 miles apart,
00:55:07 it would be a long time before I was able to go home at all,
00:55:09 and I wasn’t able to be there when it happened.
00:55:15 Earlier this year, my son, Nathan, died
00:55:19 in a tragic accident.
00:55:21 He was two years old.
00:55:24 At that time, I asked Jehovah (the question),
00:55:26 “Why is this happening to me?ʺ
00:55:30 There were friends there before we got there.
00:55:34 Before we got to the place that we knew we were going to evacuate to,
00:55:38 (because they asked, “Where are you going to be?”)
00:55:41 they were willing to just provide anything that we needed
00:55:44 before we even knew what it was that we needed
00:55:48 —and especially spiritually.
00:55:51 Even when I didn’t know that we needed to say a prayer, it was there.
00:55:58 In those moments, we saw Jehovah’s hand.
00:56:03 Brothers would come by and give us food.
00:56:08 There was even a brother that called me
00:56:10 when things started to go bad and said,
00:56:13 “I think you’re going to need some money.”
00:56:19 And without saying anything, he came and left an envelope outside our apartment.
00:56:26 When we opened the envelope, we saw that there was exactly the amount we needed
00:56:30 to pay the bills and to buy things that we needed for the apartment.
00:56:37 I had only learned about brotherly love,
00:56:39 but during that time, I really understood what it truly means.
00:56:45 During that time, brothers who we did not even know called us,
00:56:50 they spent time with us,
00:56:52 they prayed with us,
00:56:55 they spent a lot of their time encouraging us.
00:56:58 During that time, I saw evidence of Jehovah’s hand in our lives.
00:57:04 I was really, really struggling one day, and I had to reach out to Jehovah in prayer
00:57:08 and just try and throw all my burdens on him,
00:57:10 and not two minutes after I finished that prayer
00:57:15 is when an elder reached out to me
00:57:17 and gave me the best shepherding call I think I’ve ever had in my life.
00:57:21 And clearly, that was Jehovah reaching out to me
00:57:24 and trying to show me that he understood how I felt and was there for me.
00:57:29 After intensive care, I felt that I needed someone to hold my hand,
00:57:34 so I understood that Jehovah would take me by the hand.
00:57:37 A sister visited me every day,
00:57:40 she helped me get dressed, she brushed my hair,
00:57:44 and we went for short walks along the corridor.
00:57:47 Now I can really see how compassionate and considerate Jehovah is
00:57:51 and that he knows how to support us.
00:57:54 He knows us inside and out.
00:57:56 While we were going through this difficult time,
00:57:59 Jehovah helped us so much, and we definitely saw his hand in our lives.
00:58:03 And in the future, if any difficulty should occur,
00:58:06 we are confident that Jehovah will help us and protect us.
00:58:11 It doesn’t matter what we face,
00:58:13 it’ll get worse and worse in this system.
00:58:15 But we know that Jehovah
00:58:16 can get us through absolutely anything.
00:58:18 I’ve seen the overwhelming evidence
00:58:20 in my own life;
00:58:21 I’ve seen it for others too.
00:58:22 And whatever Satan throws at us,
00:58:25 it doesn’t matter,
00:58:26 because Jehovah is stronger.
00:58:27 He’s the most powerful ally
00:58:29 that we could have.
00:58:33 At this annual meeting, we have heard so much about what the Governing Body,
00:58:38 under the direction of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus,
00:58:41 are doing to strengthen Jehovah’s people worldwide.
00:58:46 But brothers and sisters,
00:58:48 do you know one thing that is strengthening the Governing Body
00:58:52 to continue on in our work?
00:58:54 It’s you.
00:58:56 It’s every one of you brothers and sisters out in the field.
00:59:01 We know what you’re going through.
00:59:03 We read your cards and letters.
00:59:06 We hear your expressions.
00:59:08 We know you’re suffering through a difficult time.
00:59:12 And yet you keep going; you keep enduring;
00:59:16 you keep serving Jehovah faithfully.
00:59:19 That not only warms our hearts
00:59:22 but it strengthens our own faith to continue serving Jehovah.
00:59:28 We are facing a challenging time now.
00:59:31 And as we face the great tribulation,
00:59:33 we will face even greater challenges.
00:59:38 We may have times of discouragement
00:59:40 just like Gideon had, just like Habakkuk had,
00:59:43 just as Elijah had.
00:59:46 But we will also prove faithful to the end
00:59:49 just as each of those men did.
00:59:52 If we do what?
00:59:54 If we keep looking for Jehovah,
00:59:57 if we keep searching for his hand,
01:00:00 if we keep turning up our “spiritual hearing aids”
01:00:05 so that we can be attentive to the ways
01:00:07 that Jehovah will use to help us
01:00:10 and to strengthen us and to direct us.
01:00:13 Yes, dear brothers and sisters,
01:00:15 keep on asking,
01:00:17 “Where is Jehovah?”
01:00:22 That was upbuilding.
01:00:25 What a blessing to have now enjoyed
01:00:28 the entire annual meeting program!
01:00:31 We hope that it will help you to continue preaching about Jehovah
01:00:36 and his Kingdom with renewed zeal.
01:00:40 It’s true that this world seems to be
01:00:43 in more turmoil than ever before,
01:00:45 but it’s clear that Jehovah’s holy spirit
01:00:49 is guiding us during these troublesome times.
01:00:56 We’ll conclude this month’s program
01:00:59 with our video postcard, which comes to us from the Solomon Islands,
01:01:02 where my wife and I enjoyed the privilege of serving a convention
01:01:07 a number of years ago.
01:01:09 Located northeast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean,
01:01:13 the Solomon Islands comprise six main islands
01:01:17 and almost one thousand smaller islands, atolls, and reefs.
01:01:21 This archipelago was the site
01:01:24 of intense warfare during World War II,
01:01:28 and remnants of that war still litter beaches
01:01:31 in the water just offshore.
01:01:34 The official language of the country is English.
01:01:37 However, most residents speak Melanesian Pidgin
01:01:41 and other indigenous languages.
01:01:43 Our publications
01:01:45 and videos are being translated
01:01:47 into ten of those languages.
01:01:49 In the Solomon Islands,
01:01:51 you’ll find tree-filled mountainous terrain, beautiful beaches,
01:01:55 volcanoes, and even volcanic steam vents on the island of Simbo.
01:02:00 But this breathtaking beauty
01:02:02 comes with inherent challenges caused by nature,
01:02:05 such as frequent cyclones and earthquakes.
01:02:09 The majority of the people in the Solomon Islands live in rural areas,
01:02:13 while about 20 percent of the population resides
01:02:16 in urban areas, including the capital city
01:02:19 of Honiara, where our branch office is located.
01:02:23 In Honiara, our brothers cover the territory
01:02:25 with the good news just as you do.
01:02:28 However, at the time this video postcard was recorded,
01:02:31 the brothers in Honiara and the more than 2,000 publishers
01:02:35 in the Solomon Islands had to adjust their preaching methods
01:02:39 because of the worldwide pandemic.
01:02:42 Like many of us, they quickly found
01:02:43 alternative ways to accomplish their ministry.
01:02:47 For example, although many publishers
01:02:50 in the Honiara Kukum Congregation do not own
01:02:54 personal cell phones, they found ways to make phone calls.
01:02:58 At times, even before our brothers could call a return visit,
01:03:02 the householder was already calling them
01:03:05 to ask more questions about the Bible.
01:03:08 The 105 publishers of the Honiara Kukum Congregation
01:03:12 were happy to have a total
01:03:15 of 490 attend the Memorial in 2020.
01:03:18 And now they send you
01:03:21 their warm love and greetings.
01:03:24 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:03:27 this is JW Broadcasting!

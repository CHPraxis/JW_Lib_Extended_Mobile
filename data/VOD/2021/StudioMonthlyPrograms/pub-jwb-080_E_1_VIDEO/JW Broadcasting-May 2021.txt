00:00:02 Welcome, brothers and sisters.
00:00:04 In this month’s program,
00:00:07 we’ll review who the May 2020 Watchtower
00:00:10 identified as “the king of the north,”
00:00:13 and we’ll learn how knowing this
00:00:15 affects each one of us.
00:00:18 We’ll also see how perseverance helps us
00:00:21 reach our spiritual goals.
00:00:24 And we’ll debut an exciting new series
00:00:28 made especially for teenagers.
00:00:33 This is JW Broadcasting for May 2021.
00:00:58 My theme is “‘The King of the North’ in the Time of the End.”
00:01:03 In recent years, the Russian government
00:01:06 has persecuted our brothers and sisters
00:01:09 who live in that country.
00:01:11 You’ve heard reports about the police invading Kingdom Halls
00:01:15 and breaking up meetings.
00:01:17 The government has labeled Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:20 as an “extremist group.”
00:01:22 It has seized our properties and imprisoned our brothers.
00:01:27 Please watch a brief video
00:01:29 that reviews some of the trials
00:01:31 Jehovah’s people in Russia have faced.
00:01:36 On April 20, 2017,
00:01:38 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation criminalized
00:01:41 the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:46 As of July 4, 2019,
00:01:49 authorities have progressively seized 131 of the properties
00:01:53 owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:56 with an additional 60 properties subject to confiscation.
00:01:58 One of the seized properties
00:02:00 was the former Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye.
00:02:05 At the time of filming, the Russian authorities continue
00:02:08 their aggressive attack on Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:11 As of August 17, 2020,
00:02:14 there were 42 Witnesses who were in pretrial detention
00:02:16 or sentenced to prison,
00:02:19 32 who were under house arrest,
00:02:22 and 169 who were not allowed to leave their hometown.
00:02:25 All have been charged with organizing,
00:02:28 participating in, or financing the activity
00:02:31 of a so-called “extremist” organization.
00:02:34 At least 380 Witnesses were, at the time, under investigation
00:02:38 —ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.
00:02:43 What has this meant for the individuals affected?
00:02:46 As an example,
00:02:48 on June 3, 2018,
00:02:50 Brother Sergey Klimov was arrested.
00:02:54 Local authorities initiated
00:02:55 criminal charges against him,
00:02:57 placing him in pretrial detention for two months.
00:03:00 This detention was extended seven times,
00:03:04 separating him from his wife and family
00:03:06 for a year and five months,
00:03:08 before he was finally tried and sentenced.
00:03:12 On November 5, 2019,
00:03:14 he was sentenced to six years in prison.
00:03:22 Two of our dear young people in Russia,
00:03:24 Brother Yegor Baranov and Sister Darya Dulova,
00:03:27 are courageously facing criminal conviction
00:03:29 and potential long-term imprisonment.
00:03:33 Brother Baranov is only 19 years old.
00:03:35 When the authorities raided her home, Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.
00:03:43 By means of the Newsroom on jw.org,
00:03:45 we are informed of updated news events.
00:03:47 This page includes links to name lists
00:03:49 of Witnesses currently imprisoned for their faith,
00:03:52 which can help us include them specifically in our prayers.
00:03:56 Our brothers and sisters in Russia are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah
00:03:59 despite any opposition,
00:04:02 and they put their confidence in him in the assurance
00:04:05 that Jehovah is on their side!
00:04:20 It shouldn’t surprise us
00:04:22 that this powerful government has been persecuting
00:04:25 our peaceful, law-abiding brothers and sisters.
00:04:29 Why not?
00:04:31 Because that government is fulfilling Bible prophecy!
00:04:36 Please find Daniel chapter 11.
00:04:40 In verse 40, it refers to what the Bible calls
00:04:44 “the king of the north.”
00:04:46 Of that “king,” Daniel 11:41 says:
00:04:50 “He will also enter into the land of the Decoration,
00:04:55 and many lands will be made to stumble.”
00:05:00 Today, Russia and its allies
00:05:03 are filling the role of the king of the north.
00:05:07 Daniel foretold that this king would enter
00:05:10 “the land of the Decoration,”
00:05:12 meaning that he would interfere in a significant way
00:05:16 with the activities of God’s people.
00:05:19 As discussed in the May 2020 Watchtower,
00:05:22 Russia and its allies are not the first political power
00:05:26 to act as the king of the north,
00:05:28 but they may well be the last.
00:05:32 In this program, we will do three things:
00:05:36 First,
00:05:36 we’ll briefly trace the fulfillment of the prophecy
00:05:40 recorded in Daniel chapter 11.
00:05:44 Second, we’ll look at how that prophecy
00:05:47 is being fulfilled today.
00:05:50 And third, we’ll discuss how knowing this information
00:05:54 should affect the decisions that we make.
00:05:58 Brother Herman van Selm, a helper to the Writing Committee,
00:06:02 will help us review some of the key points of the prophecy
00:06:06 recorded in Daniel chapter 11.
00:06:10 Thank you, Herman, for helping me with this presentation.
00:06:14 It’s a pleasure to be with you, Ken.
00:06:16 Thank you for inviting me.
00:06:20 First, let’s briefly trace
00:06:22 how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far.
00:06:27 The prophecy in Daniel chapter 11 mentions
00:06:29 “the king of the north” and “the king of the south.”
00:06:32 Now, why are they described like that?
00:06:35 Well, initially,
00:06:37 these powers were located north and south
00:06:41 of the literal land of Israel,
00:06:43 thus the names king of the north
00:06:46 and king of the south.
00:06:48 These powers could be viewed as two thrones.
00:06:52 Over time, those thrones have been occupied
00:06:55 by various political powers
00:06:57 and these rival kings compete for world domination.
00:07:01 And what about Jehovah’s people?
00:07:03 They are right at the center of this conflict.
00:07:09 But let’s start at the beginning.
00:07:12 Ken,
00:07:13 what is the origin of the kings of the north and of the south?
00:07:18 The kings of the north and of the south
00:07:21 both rose from the empire
00:07:23 established by Alexander the Great.
00:07:26 One line of kings ruled over Egypt,
00:07:29 which is south of Israel.
00:07:31 And that dynasty was the first
00:07:33 to fill the role of king of the south.
00:07:37 During this period, another line of kings
00:07:39 ruled an area north of Israel
00:07:42 and those kings filled the role
00:07:45 of king of the north.
00:07:47 Then the Roman Empire took over
00:07:50 as king of the north.
00:07:53 As discussed in the May 2020 Watchtower,
00:07:57 God’s people are the focal point
00:07:59 of the prophecy recorded in Daniel chapter 11.
00:08:03 The angel who spoke with Daniel said that the prophecy
00:08:07 would help him “understand what will befall your people”
00:08:12 —that is, the nation of Israel.
00:08:16 And what, in fact, happened?
00:08:19 Well, the Jewish nation was God’s people until 33 C.E.
00:08:24 But after that, a change occurred.
00:08:26 Jehovah poured out his holy spirit
00:08:29 on Christ’s followers.
00:08:30 And from then on,
00:08:32 the congregation of true Christians
00:08:34 became God’s people.
00:08:38 Galatians 6:16 refers to them
00:08:41 as “the Israel of God.”
00:08:45 That point is significant
00:08:47 because the kings of the north and south can only be identified
00:08:52 when there is a clearly defined group of God’s people on earth.
00:08:57 Why is that the case?
00:08:59 Because, as we just considered,
00:09:02 the angel had told Daniel
00:09:04 that the prophecy centers on God’s people.
00:09:08 In the second century C.E.,
00:09:11 true Christians were overgrown
00:09:14 by weedlike false Christians.
00:09:17 In his illustration of the wheat and the weeds,
00:09:19 Jesus foretold that this would happen.
00:09:22 That illustration is recorded
00:09:24 at Matthew 13:36-43.
00:09:29 So from the second century onward,
00:09:33 we can no longer identify an organized group of true Christians.
00:09:37 And, as we considered, for that same reason,
00:09:40 we also cannot identify
00:09:42 the king of the north and the king of the south.
00:09:45 But in the 1870’s, a group of Bible students
00:09:50 began to separate itself from false Christians.
00:09:53 This group,
00:09:54 which included Charles T. Russell,
00:09:57 rejected teachings
00:09:58 that were not based on the Bible.
00:10:01 And like the first-century Christians,
00:10:03 they promoted the truths
00:10:05 taught in God’s Word.
00:10:07 Now this group underwent a development
00:10:11 that is foretold at Malachi 3:1.
00:10:15 They were the “messenger”
00:10:18 who would “clear up a way” before Jehovah.
00:10:21 And as events that followed prove,
00:10:24 this group clearly had God’s backing.
00:10:28 So from the 1870’s onward,
00:10:30 when true Christians began to organize themselves as a group,
00:10:34 we can again identify the political powers
00:10:38 that fill the roles of the king of the north
00:10:41 and king of the south.
00:10:43 At that time in history,
00:10:46 Britain was the dominant political force
00:10:49 and it filled the role
00:10:51 of the king of the south.
00:10:53 Amazingly, it was also in the 1870’s
00:10:57 that the German Empire emerged
00:11:00 and soon began to challenge Britain
00:11:02 for world domination.
00:11:04 This political power now filled the role
00:11:07 of the king of the north.
00:11:09 Daniel 11:25, 26 indicate
00:11:14 that the two kings would clash
00:11:17 and that the king of the north would lose many soldiers in the battle.
00:11:21 And that is exactly what happened
00:11:25 during World War I.
00:11:26 And it was during that war
00:11:28 that Britain and its close ally,
00:11:31 the United States,
00:11:33 forged a special bond.
00:11:35 So from this point on,
00:11:38 during these last days,
00:11:39 the Anglo-American power
00:11:42 has been the king of the south.
00:11:45 That brings us to our second point:
00:11:48 How has Daniel chapter 11 been fulfilled
00:11:52 from that time onward
00:11:54 until recent times?
00:11:57 During World War I,
00:11:59 the king of the north and the king of the south
00:12:02 persecuted those of God’s people who refused to fight in the war.
00:12:07 The king of the south even threw into jail
00:12:10 those who were taking the lead in the preaching work.
00:12:13 But let’s take a closer look at the king of the north.
00:12:17 Has the political power filling that role
00:12:20 changed during the last days?
00:12:23 And how has it treated God’s people?
00:12:26 The identity of the king of the north
00:12:29 has changed three times during the last days.
00:12:32 Starting in the 1870’s through to the end of the second world war,
00:12:37 the German Empire
00:12:39 filled the role of the king of the north.
00:12:42 In the period leading up to and including World War II,
00:12:47 it persecuted God’s people without mercy,
00:12:50 imprisoning thousands of our brothers
00:12:53 and killing hundreds of them.
00:12:56 Who replaced the German Empire as the king of the north?
00:13:00 That’s an important question, Herman.
00:13:03 After World War II,
00:13:05 the Soviet Union took on that role.
00:13:08 It also attacked God’s people,
00:13:10 imprisoning them or sending them into exile.
00:13:15 But, Ken, Daniel 11:34 says
00:13:18 that they—that is, God’s people—
00:13:21 would be “given a little help.”
00:13:24 What’s the significance of that statement?
00:13:27 This passage points forward to the time
00:13:30 when the Soviet Union collapsed.
00:13:33 Although God’s people suffered terribly under that government,
00:13:36 they were “given a little help.”
00:13:39 In what way?
00:13:41 After the USSR collapsed,
00:13:44 God’s people there could worship freely for a number of years.
00:13:48 In time, though, Russia and its allies
00:13:51 took on the role of the king of the north.
00:13:55 And like the other powers that filled the role of king of the north,
00:13:59 this government has continued to oppress God’s people.
00:14:04 Let’s watch the following video
00:14:07 that outlines what has happened.
00:14:14 Daniel received a prophecy
00:14:16 about the coming of two rivals:
00:14:18 “the king of the north”
00:14:20 and “the king of the south.”
00:14:23 How has it been fulfilled?
00:14:31 In the late 1800’s, the German Empire
00:14:34 became the king of the north.
00:14:36 That government brought
00:14:38 its “power and . . . heart
00:14:39 “against the king of the south
00:14:40 with a large army.”
00:14:43 In fact, its navy was
00:14:45 the second largest on earth.
00:14:50 Who became the king of the south?
00:14:53 The alliance between Britain
00:14:55 and the United States.
00:14:57 He fought during World War I
00:14:59 “with an exceedingly large
00:15:01 and mighty army.”
00:15:03 He “swept away” and “humbled”
00:15:05 the king of the north.
00:15:09 But that was not the end
00:15:10 of the king of the north.
00:15:12 He turned his attention to and then hurled
00:15:14 “denunciations against the holy covenant.”
00:15:19 He removed “the constant feature”
00:15:21 by limiting the freedom of God’s people
00:15:23 to preach,
00:15:26 imprisoning many,
00:15:28 and even killing hundreds
00:15:30 of God’s anointed ones
00:15:31 and their fellow workers.
00:15:36 After Germany was defeated in World War II,
00:15:38 the Soviet Union
00:15:40 became the king of the north.
00:15:42 It worked with the king of the south
00:15:44 to “put in place the disgusting thing
00:15:47 that causes desolation”
00:15:49 —the United Nations.
00:16:01 Beginning in the early 1900’s,
00:16:03 the Soviet government tried to eliminate
00:16:06 religion in the lands under its control,
00:16:10 fulfilling the words
00:16:11 that he would “show no regard
00:16:13 for the God of his fathers.”
00:16:19 He gave glory, not to the God of heaven,
00:16:22 but “to the god of fortresses.”
00:16:26 As prophesied,
00:16:28 he used this military might
00:16:29 against the king of the south
00:16:31 by engaging “with him in a pushing.”
00:16:35 Anglo-America competed
00:16:36 with the Soviet Union
00:16:37 for world domination,
00:16:39 fighting in and supporting wars
00:16:41 and political struggles around the globe.
00:16:48 After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,
00:16:51 it was unclear who would fill the role of the king of the north.
00:16:55 For a time, God’s people there
00:16:57 had been able to preach and worship peacefully.
00:17:01 But in recent years, Russia and its allies
00:17:04 have pushed back at the king of the south.
00:17:07 Both kings have accused each other
00:17:09 of destructive cyber and economic attacks.
00:17:13 But the king of the north has not limited
00:17:16 his attacks to the king of the south.
00:17:18 As foretold, he also entered
00:17:20 “into the land of the Decoration”
00:17:23 —our realm of spiritual activity.
00:17:27 Today, Russian authorities continue
00:17:29 to attack true worship.
00:17:33 We expect such persecution,
00:17:36 but we also expect it to end.
00:17:58 Our King, Jesus Christ,
00:18:00 is more powerful than any human government.
00:18:05 Soon he will destroy not only the kings of the north and the south
00:18:10 but all of his enemies,
00:18:13 and he will deliver God’s loyal people.
00:18:47 That was a powerful and touching video!
00:18:51 How are our brothers and sisters coping with the current persecution?
00:18:55 Let’s take a look.
00:18:57 And what you’re going to see will break your heart
00:19:01 but also strengthen your faith.
00:19:06 At 6:00 a.m.,
00:19:08 my husband and I were woken up
00:19:10 by a loud bang on the door.
00:19:13 As soon as my husband had opened the door,
00:19:15 people burst in shouting,
00:19:17 “Everyone on the floor!”
00:19:19 I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen
00:19:21 and heard them
00:19:23 very aggressively ordering him to do something.
00:19:25 Then I heard some noise, and I realized
00:19:27 that he was being beaten.
00:19:30 My husband, Feliks, and I
00:19:32 were on our way back from the shopping mall
00:19:35 to the car park.
00:19:36 A jeep with tinted windows
00:19:38 blocked our path, and people
00:19:40 with weapons jumped out, shouting:
00:19:42 “On the ground! Don’t move!”
00:19:45 We were thrown against the vehicle.
00:19:47 Feliks was sent to a pretrial detention facility,
00:19:50 where he spent a year.
00:19:54 From the very first bang on the door,
00:19:57 I began praying to Jehovah for wisdom, calmness,
00:20:01 and for holy spirit so that I could make the right decisions
00:20:04 and act in the right way.
00:20:05 And for the whole day, I was praying.
00:20:07 Jehovah answered all my prayers,
00:20:09 and I felt that he was close at my side.
00:20:16 Before each court hearing when I was very afraid
00:20:19 and felt overwhelmed by emotion and couldn’t calm myself down,
00:20:22 it was prayer
00:20:24 that helped me to settle down.
00:20:28 When they took us for interrogation,
00:20:30 I started panicking and, at that moment,
00:20:34 I realized that I needed to meditate on something positive.
00:20:37 So I thought,
00:20:39 ‘I need to sing our songs.’
00:20:41 And just one song came into my mind:
00:20:44 “He Will Make You Strong.”
00:20:46 It really strengthened me.
00:20:49 Those words about how Jehovah gave his Son for us
00:20:51 show he loves us and will never leave us.
00:20:56 Brothers and sisters
00:20:58 pray and tell me
00:21:01 that they are praying for me.
00:21:03 It gives me the feeling that I am part
00:21:05 of a large family.
00:21:09 After the interrogation,
00:21:12 he was sent home.
00:21:13 My husband and I
00:21:15 continue to stick to our spiritual routine.
00:21:19 We continue to conduct family worship, and we are always in the ministry.
00:21:24 Our brothers and sisters constantly support us.
00:21:27 They write kind words;
00:21:29 they commend us;
00:21:32 they send us encouraging scriptures from the Bible.
00:21:36 In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty
00:21:40 and sentenced to three years in a general regime colony.
00:21:45 When he and the other brothers arrived there,
00:21:48 they were beaten up by officers from the colony.
00:21:54 Feliks told me
00:21:55 that he prayed while he was being beaten,
00:21:59 and he noticed that at that moment, he stopped feeling the pain.
00:22:06 While he is behind bars,
00:22:08 Feliks tries to conduct family worship with me by letters.
00:22:13 He picks certain themes and some specific questions.
00:22:17 Then I do research
00:22:19 in the publications and send back what I find.
00:22:24 The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30 really strengthens me,
00:22:27 where it says that “your strength will be
00:22:30 in keeping calm and showing trust.”
00:22:34 Although I tend to worry,
00:22:37 I understand that calmness is expressed
00:22:40 by fully trusting in Jehovah.
00:22:44 I have become stronger because thanks to Jehovah,
00:22:47 in a way, I have developed almost a shell
00:22:51 against the difficulties
00:22:53 that used to scare me.
00:22:54 That confidence and faith help me.
00:22:56 Jehovah was with me,
00:22:58 and he will remain
00:23:00 close by me,
00:23:01 and we will be made stronger thanks to him,
00:23:03 and we will get through these trials.
00:23:10 How can we develop courage
00:23:13 like our brothers and sisters in Russia?
00:23:16 Well, we must be convinced
00:23:19 that the prophecies in the Bible are trustworthy.
00:23:24 That was a topic discussed
00:23:26 by Brother David Splane of the Governing Body
00:23:29 in the following Morning Worship program.
00:23:33 Now, if you’d just
00:23:35 take a look at today’s text,
00:23:38 it says: “Come and witness
00:23:42 the activities of Jehovah”—witness.
00:23:47 Now, according to a dictionary,
00:23:49 a witness is someone who has personal knowledge of something.
00:23:54 So how can we be Witnesses of Jehovah?
00:23:58 What personal knowledge
00:24:01 do we have of his activities?
00:24:04 Well, first of all, we can testify to the fact
00:24:08 that Jehovah can see into the future.
00:24:10 And when he does that, he is right 100 percent of the time.
00:24:14 And second, we know that no one can prevent
00:24:18 what Jehovah foresees from coming true.
00:24:21 All of Jehovah’s prophecies come true.
00:24:25 Now, to illustrate the first point,
00:24:28 that Jehovah can see into the future,
00:24:30 let’s consider two remarkable prophecies
00:24:33 concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple.
00:24:38 Now, we know that through the prophet Jeremiah,
00:24:42 Jehovah foretold that Jerusalem and the temple
00:24:45 would be destroyed by the Babylonians.
00:24:47 Did it come true?
00:24:49 Absolutely—in 607 B.C.E.
00:24:53 But Jehovah went further.
00:24:55 He said that Jerusalem would be rebuilt.
00:24:58 “They will rebuild the ancient ruins;
00:25:02 “they will raise up the desolated places of the past,
00:25:05 and they will restore the devastated cities.”
00:25:09 And true worship would also be restored.
00:25:13 So that was quite a level of knowledge.
00:25:16 But there’s more.
00:25:18 Jehovah went further.
00:25:20 Jehovah also indicated
00:25:22 that the spiritual revival wouldn’t last.
00:25:26 Now, that is remarkable.
00:25:28 And it’s implied by what we read in the second part
00:25:31 of Daniel 9:26.
00:25:34 I’d like you to have a look at this.
00:25:36 We’re going to be reading
00:25:39 two parts of this verse,
00:25:42 and it’s quite interesting
00:25:44 —Daniel 9:26.
00:25:49 So now, what’s our objective here?
00:25:52 It’s to see that Jerusalem and its temple
00:25:56 would be destroyed a second time
00:26:00 and that true worship would not last.
00:26:02 It says in the second part of verse 26:
00:26:06 “And the people of a leader who is coming
00:26:11 will destroy the city and the holy place.”
00:26:15 Now, when these words were written,
00:26:18 Jerusalem and the temple were already in ruins.
00:26:22 But Jehovah doesn’t say,
00:26:24 ‘Nebuchadnezzar has destroyed the city and its temple.’
00:26:27 He says: “The people of a leader who is coming.”
00:26:31 The Roman general Titus in 70 C.E.
00:26:35 “will destroy the city and the holy place.”
00:26:38 In order for that prophecy to be fulfilled,
00:26:40 Jerusalem and the temple would have to be rebuilt
00:26:44 and then destroyed a second time.
00:26:48 Now, that is quite a level of knowledge —quite a level of information.
00:26:53 But what would make this necessary?
00:26:55 Why, when the Jews came back to the Promised Land
00:27:00 and they were intent on restoring true worship,
00:27:04 why would this fail?
00:27:06 And why would Jerusalem and the temple be destroyed a second time?
00:27:10 Part of it is due to what we find in the first part of verse 26:
00:27:16 “Messiah will be cut off.”
00:27:20 So Jehovah foretold, foresaw,
00:27:25 that when the Messiah came,
00:27:27 the Jews would reject him.
00:27:30 He would be cut off.
00:27:32 And because of that, partly because of that,
00:27:35 Jerusalem and the temple would be destroyed,
00:27:38 as it happens, in 70 C.E.
00:27:41 Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
00:27:44 Let’s think about that a minute.
00:27:46 The Messiah comes first and Jerusalem and the temple
00:27:51 are destroyed after that in 70 C.E.
00:27:54 What does that mean?
00:27:56 It means that the Messiah comes before 70 C.E.
00:28:01 So we might ask our Jewish friends,
00:28:04 why are you still waiting for the Messiah?
00:28:07 70 C.E. has come and gone.
00:28:11 Well, the Messiah came, and he too proved to be a true prophet.
00:28:16 And a remarkable prophecy of Jesus is found in the Sermon on the Mount.
00:28:20 Let’s have a look at it and consider the implications of this prophecy.
00:28:25 This is Matthew chapter 7,
00:28:32 and we’ll read verses 22 and 23,
00:28:35 an amazing prophecy.
00:28:37 Now, imagine: At this point, Jesus’ teachings
00:28:41 have not spread beyond Israel.
00:28:45 But notice verses 22 and 23:
00:28:48 “Many will say to me on that day:
00:28:51 “‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,
00:28:55 “‘and expel demons in your name,
00:28:57 “and perform many powerful works in your name?’
00:29:00 “And then I will declare to them: ‘I never knew you!
00:29:03 Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness!’”
00:29:08 Now, isn’t that amazing?
00:29:09 If Jesus had simply predicted
00:29:11 that his teachings would spread throughout the earth,
00:29:13 you might say, “Well, there’s nothing remarkable about that.”
00:29:16 But Jesus is saying something different.
00:29:18 Jesus is foretelling
00:29:20 a great apostasy from his teachings.
00:29:25 Jesus is foretelling the birth of Christendom
00:29:28 300 years before the event.
00:29:33 So Jesus foresees that many
00:29:37 are going to turn away from the truth.
00:29:40 And by the end of the first century,
00:29:42 that apostasy was already at work, wasn’t it?
00:29:45 There were sects
00:29:47 —the sect of Nicolaus, for example, and other sects.
00:29:51 And now they’re on the cusp of the great darkness,
00:29:55 the great apostasy, that’s going to set in from the second century on.
00:30:00 And with this in mind, what does Jehovah do?
00:30:03 He makes an amazing statement
00:30:07 —Revelation 14—
00:30:10 ‘144,00 will be on Mount Zion with the Lamb.’
00:30:15 There were nowhere near 144,000 in the truth in the first century.
00:30:20 And here Jehovah is saying there are going to be 144,000 in heaven
00:30:25 with the Lamb at the end.
00:30:27 But not only that, he goes further.
00:30:29 There’s going to be a ‘great crowd that no man can number.’
00:30:32 How could that ever come true?
00:30:35 Ours is the God of true prophecy.
00:30:38 Well, that’s prophecy.
00:30:41 What about the second point?
00:30:43 And that is that no one can prevent prophecy from being fulfilled.
00:30:47 The Devil would love to prevent that from taking place.
00:30:50 Think about Revelation 14.
00:30:52 If the Devil could make the number
00:30:55 one short of 144,000,
00:30:58 he’d be happy because he would show
00:31:01 that Jehovah was inaccurate in what he foretold.
00:31:05 And so that’s one of the reasons why the Devil
00:31:07 has made war on the remnant of the seed of the woman,
00:31:11 if at all possible, to prevent that number
00:31:14 of 144,000 from coming to pass.
00:31:18 But, of course, he’s going to fail.
00:31:21 And what about the prophecy in the Bible
00:31:24 that America and Britain would become a dual world power?
00:31:29 Now, Britain wouldn’t become a world power
00:31:31 at all if France had anything to say about it.
00:31:33 France and Britain were sworn enemies.
00:31:36 And for many, many, years,
00:31:39 France was much richer and much more powerful
00:31:42 than Britain was.
00:31:45 And finally, at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,
00:31:49 France had one last chance
00:31:51 to prevent Britain from becoming a world power.
00:31:55 And France should have won that battle.
00:31:57 Everything was stacked against the British.
00:32:01 But there was a driving rain,
00:32:03 a fatal miscalculation on the part of Napoleon,
00:32:07 and a few other factors that foiled their attempt.
00:32:11 And Britain did become a world power.
00:32:13 And at the end of the 19th century,
00:32:16 it’s quite true that the sun never set on the British Empire.
00:32:21 But now, America and Britain were supposed to become a dual world power,
00:32:26 and Britain wasn’t the least bit interested in sharing its power with America.
00:32:30 It tried to prevent America from separating as a colony.
00:32:35 There was a long war,
00:32:38 and there were mistakes made on both sides.
00:32:41 But finally, America gained its independence from Britain.
00:32:44 Well, what do we find?
00:32:46 Some years after that,
00:32:48 Britain is sharing its power with America.
00:32:52 They are a dual world power.
00:32:55 Fighters against God will never prevail.
00:32:59 We serve “the God of true prophecy.”
00:33:03 And “what he foretells comes to be.”
00:33:09 As we’ve discussed,
00:33:11 each detail of the prophecy recorded at Daniel chapter 11
00:33:15 has come true so far.
00:33:18 We must have confidence
00:33:20 that the remaining events described in that prophecy
00:33:23 will also come true.
00:33:25 We are living in the last days of the time of the end.
00:33:30 Soon, the nations will fulfill the prophecy
00:33:34 at 1 Thessalonians 5:3:
00:33:37 “Whenever it is that they are saying,
00:33:40 “‘Peace and security!’
00:33:42 “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,
00:33:47 “just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,
00:33:50 and they will by no means escape.”
00:33:54 Then “sudden destruction”
00:33:56 comes upon all parts of Satan’s system.
00:34:00 As you can see on the screen,
00:34:03 Daniel 12:1 says:
00:34:05 “During that time Michael will stand up,
00:34:09 “the great prince who is standing in behalf of your people.
00:34:13 “And there will occur a time of distress such as has not occurred
00:34:18 “since there came to be a nation until that time.
00:34:21 “And during that time your people will escape,
00:34:26 everyone who is found written down in the book.”
00:34:31 That leads us into our third point:
00:34:34 How should knowing the information
00:34:37 that we have just discussed
00:34:39 affect the decisions that we make?
00:34:42 Well, what we have reviewed is not just interesting history;
00:34:46 it’s a dramatic prelude
00:34:49 to what will soon happen here on earth.
00:34:52 Jehovah has given his people this knowledge
00:34:56 so that we can act on it.
00:34:58 It should influence the choices we make.
00:35:02 In the following dramatization,
00:35:04 notice how one young brother makes decisions
00:35:08 based on his understanding of Daniel’s prophecy.
00:35:14 That was my best friend, Lucas,
00:35:18 when we were kids.
00:35:19 And that was me, Oscar.
00:35:22 We knew exactly what we wanted to do
00:35:25 when we grew up:
00:35:27 Pioneer!
00:35:28 Go to Bethel!
00:35:30 Build Kingdom Halls!
00:35:32 We kept those goals.
00:35:34 And when graduation came,
00:35:36 we were ready.
00:35:44 Our little business needed just a few more accounts.
00:35:48 Then we’d have enough for us and to help our families.
00:35:54 Finally!
00:35:55 Day one of the service year
00:35:59 —and two new pioneers!
00:36:04 Where we live, . . .
00:36:06 Please don’t call me ever again!
00:36:09 . . . finding spiritual interest is tough.
00:36:25 We already have cleaners. Thanks.
00:36:27 And finding enough work was harder than we thought.
00:36:31 A few months in, I was sure
00:36:34 Jehovah would help if we just stuck it out.
00:36:37 Sorry, Oscar. Can’t make it today.
00:36:40 Something came up. Lucas.
00:36:45 What came up was an opportunity for more money,
00:36:49 but at what cost?
00:36:55 Are you quitting, or what?
00:36:58 No, I’m not quitting.
00:37:01 Pioneering or our business?
00:37:05 Neither, but you know the struggle here.
00:37:07 Most brothers can afford to pioneer for a year, two tops.
00:37:11 Look, it’s not full-time while I’m training.
00:37:14 It’s a backup plan.
00:37:51 So Lucas stopped pioneering?
00:37:59 Maybe he’s right.
00:38:04 He’s just being practical.
00:38:09 I mean, is it wrong to quit if you think it’s not working?
00:38:15 I struggled with the same question when I pioneered.
00:38:20 Whatever you decide,
00:38:23 if you can tell Jehovah your reason
00:38:25 with a clean conscience,
00:38:28 then it’s the right decision for you.
00:38:32 Why would I keep going when it’s so difficult?
00:38:39 “Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,
00:38:42 “consider what sort of people you ought to be
00:38:45 in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.”
00:39:05 It really is “the last days,”
00:39:07 and people need “the good news.”
00:39:11 And they’ll only hear it
00:39:13 if we keep up our “deeds of godly devotion”
00:39:17 as best we can.
00:39:22 I prayed to endure and only stop pioneering
00:39:26 if my circumstances left no other choice.
00:39:30 And I prayed to see the blessings.
00:39:41 And after a while,
00:39:43 I learned that a little perseverance,
00:39:46 with Jehovah’s spirit, can be contagious.
00:39:57 So, what do you want to do when you grow up?
00:40:00 Pioneer.
00:40:02 And go to Bethel?
00:40:03 Yep!
00:40:04 And then maybe build Kingdom Halls.
00:40:05 You in?
00:40:06 Yeah.
00:40:17 That young brother was trying to figure out
00:40:19 what to do with his life.
00:40:21 He made a good decision because he allowed Bible prophecy
00:40:25 to influence his thinking.
00:40:27 We know that teens everywhere
00:40:30 face many challenges, and we feel for you.
00:40:33 Of course, I was once a teenager,
00:40:36 but I can’t even imagine some of the situations
00:40:39 that you find yourselves in.
00:40:41 But the Governing Body loves you,
00:40:44 and we want to help.
00:40:46 So I’m very happy to announce a new series
00:40:49 —“My Teen Life.”
00:40:52 You’ll hear from Witnesses
00:40:54 who share the challenges they faced in their teens
00:40:57 and how they overcame them with Jehovah’s help.
00:41:01 The interviews are candid;
00:41:03 the issues are real.
00:41:05 Here’s the first episode.
00:41:16 Well, when I was a teenager,
00:41:17 I didn’t see any benefit
00:41:19 in talking to my parents
00:41:20 because they liked different things than I liked.
00:41:25 So I thought, ‘Well, what’s the point?’
00:41:27 And I also wanted to be an adult.
00:41:31 I wanted to feel like an adult and be treated like an adult.
00:41:33 I remember when my mom used to pick me up from school.
00:41:36 She wanted to show personal interest in me,
00:41:38 so she’d ask me: “Oh, how are your friends doing?
00:41:41 “How was school today?
00:41:42 Do you have a lot of homework?”
00:41:43 But I just thought that she was being nosy.
00:41:47 I always had my earphones on.
00:41:49 And whenever my parents were trying to talk to me,
00:41:52 that was my chance to just pop them in and ignore them.
00:41:57 The way my parents grew up wasn’t
00:41:59 the same way that I grew up.
00:42:00 They grew up in a different country;
00:42:01 they spoke a different language; they grew up in a different time.
00:42:07 When you’re talking to somebody who doesn’t speak your language natively,
00:42:11 oftentimes you won’t be able to explain things from your heart.
00:42:14 And so I had that challenge.
00:42:15 I wasn’t able to talk directly to my parents heart to heart.
00:42:19 And so there was always this frustration
00:42:21 in trying to really convey how I felt.
00:42:24 And I felt like I wasn’t really getting through to my parents.
00:42:28 When I went to my first pioneer school, I learned a lot about Jehovah’s qualities.
00:42:31 And one of them was how he was a very approachable Person.
00:42:35 And I thought to myself, ‘Am I an approachable person?’
00:42:40 And I thought about how I acted in the ministry
00:42:42 and then at the meetings and then at home.
00:42:45 And I realized that at home I had a lot of things I needed to fix.
00:42:49 I felt like it was two different worlds I was living in.
00:42:51 One was when I was at school with my peers;
00:42:54 I felt like I was understood.
00:42:57 And at home, I kind of just withdrew to myself.
00:43:00 I wouldn’t try to communicate with them because it didn’t seem worth the effort.
00:43:04 I tried to figure out problems in my own way.
00:43:06 It was kind of trial and error.
00:43:11 I developed a lot of bad habits
00:43:15 that today I’m still trying to overcome.
00:43:17 If I’d been able to communicate with them more,
00:43:20 if I’d been able to connect with them and ask for their help
00:43:23 and get their support and have them on my team,
00:43:26 things would have gone a lot better.
00:43:28 And I really wish I had.
00:43:31 Jesus, who was a perfect human being
00:43:33 and who had perfect judgment, didn’t make decisions on his own.
00:43:37 He always looked to his Father for guidance.
00:43:39 And that got me thinking,
00:43:41 ‘Well, if Jesus did that,
00:43:42 ‘there has to be something good
00:43:43 in it for me too.’
00:43:45 What really helped me was Colossians 4:6.
00:43:48 I knew I needed to speak more graciously in the family.
00:43:52 And I realized that I was speaking very defensively
00:43:55 and that I needed to be more approachable to my parents.
00:43:58 When I first tried to talk with them, of course,
00:44:01 it was awkward and I didn’t want to talk about anything personal
00:44:04 because I wasn’t used to it.
00:44:06 So I thought I could maybe ask them about themselves
00:44:09 —ask them how their day was or what they liked from the meetings.
00:44:13 So I just tried to show more interest in them
00:44:15 instead of focusing on myself.
00:44:17 And I think that’s what got
00:44:18 the conversations going
00:44:19 and got me comfortable
00:44:20 to really talk with them.
00:44:22 I was so focused on how my parents weren’t understanding me
00:44:26 that I wasn’t really trying to understand them.
00:44:31 When I thought about my parents,
00:44:33 I thought about how much work it takes to be a parent.
00:44:36 From when I was a baby, for many years,
00:44:39 they were working day and night to try to care for me.
00:44:42 They never demanded a thank you or anything from me.
00:44:46 They were really self-sacrificing.
00:44:48 And I imagined: ‘If I had to work that much for somebody,
00:44:52 ‘how would I feel if they didn’t really say thank you?
00:44:56 ‘Or how would I feel
00:44:58 ‘if this person whom I worked so hard for
00:45:00 didn’t really view me as their friend?’
00:45:03 Later on, as I got older and started
00:45:06 that communication going with my parents,
00:45:09 I realized that taking their advice and really listening to their opinions
00:45:13 and always letting them know
00:45:15 what I’m going to do and where I’m going to go
00:45:18 was a mature thing to do.
00:45:21 Our heart oftentimes
00:45:22 takes the driver’s seat, and it directs us
00:45:25 to where it thinks it should go.
00:45:27 And oftentimes it goes in the wrong direction,
00:45:30 and we sometimes get hurt.
00:45:33 Then we look back and say, “I wish I hadn’t done that.”
00:45:35 And our parents have been there.
00:45:37 What they’re trying to do for us now is to tell us,
00:45:42 “Don’t let your heart take the driver’s seat.”
00:45:44 If I could talk to my teenage self,
00:45:47 I would tell myself to see my mom and dad more like coaches,
00:45:51 because I used to think they were always trying to criticize me
00:45:54 and point out my faults.
00:45:56 But, really, they’re just trying to help me,
00:45:59 and they want me to have a happy life.
00:46:02 I really wish I knew that as a teenager.
00:46:05 But I’m glad I learned that now.
00:46:27 We hope that you’ll enjoy and benefit
00:46:29 from future episodes of “My Teen Life.”
00:46:32 This new series is another way
00:46:35 the Governing Body prepares Jehovah’s people
00:46:38 to cope with today’s challenges
00:46:40 and to be ready for what’s coming.
00:46:44 Bible prophecy shows that in the near future,
00:46:48 the nations will turn on all false religions and wipe them out.
00:46:53 Then, they will launch a final attack on God’s people.
00:46:57 And what a mistake that will be!
00:47:01 As discussed in the Pure Worship book,
00:47:04 Jehovah will respond to that attack
00:47:07 by unleashing his rage on the nations.
00:47:10 After the dust of Armageddon settles,
00:47:13 those with the earthly hope can look forward
00:47:16 to a thousand years of genuine peace and security,
00:47:20 working under the rule of God’s Kingdom.
00:47:24 Before that time comes,
00:47:26 we will continue to face trials and opposition,
00:47:30 but we can endure.
00:47:32 We have many modern-day examples
00:47:34 that we can imitate right now.
00:47:37 Those examples can help all of us
00:47:39 to be prepared, to stand firm,
00:47:42 and to remain fully united in the faith.
00:47:46 This month’s original song
00:47:49 entitled “One United People”
00:47:52 encourages us to do just that.
00:48:17 We watch the storm clouds gather. We’ve seen the signs before.
00:48:30 The wind of persecution Is no stranger to our door.
00:48:43 We will face each test with courage, With Jehovah standing near.
00:48:56 And ‘no weapon formed against us’ Will give any cause for fear.
00:49:09 We are one united people,
00:49:17 Though we come from ev’ry land.
00:49:23 We are standing firm together,
00:49:30 For Jehovah makes us stand,
00:49:36 For Jehovah makes us stand.
00:49:57 We wait with calm assurance For Jehovah, the Most High—
00:50:10 The God of our salvation Whose love will never die.
00:50:23 He will never leave his people, And his spirit makes us strong.
00:50:37 No, our enemies won’t break us. To Jehovah we belong!
00:50:51 We are one united people,
00:50:58 Though we come from ev’ry land.
00:51:05 We are standing firm together,
00:51:09 For Jehovah makes us stand.
00:51:18 We stand firm together; Unafraid we face the crowd.
00:51:24 And these hearts that beat within us We have given to our God.
00:51:39 We are one united people,
00:51:46 Though we come from ev’ry land.
00:51:52 We are standing firm together,
00:51:59 For Jehovah makes us stand,
00:52:06 For Jehovah makes us stand.
00:52:22 The stirring theme of this year’s convention
00:52:26 is “Powerful By Faith!”
00:52:30 We will learn what faith is,
00:52:32 why it is essential,
00:52:34 and how we can acquire it.
00:52:37 Here is a preview.
00:52:41 It can be hard to put faith in something you cannot see.
00:52:46 But real faith is not blind.
00:52:51 Real faith is based on facts,
00:52:54 on realities,
00:52:58 on truth.
00:53:02 It gives us courage and strength,
00:53:07 and it helps us to endure.
00:53:11 When life gets hard, it provides peace.
00:53:15 It reminds us of our purpose,
00:53:19 and it brings us real joy.
00:53:24 Learn how to build and strengthen your faith
00:53:26 at the 2021 “Powerful by Faith!” Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:53:46 Now it’s time for our video postcard, which comes to us
00:53:51 from our brothers and sisters in Belarus.
00:53:57 Belarus is an Eastern European nation that borders Russia.
00:54:02 It’s known as
00:54:04 the “blue-eyed” country because it is dotted
00:54:08 with more than 10,000 lakes.
00:54:11 Some of Europe’s most ancient trees, as well as
00:54:16 its largest mammal —the European bison—
00:54:19 can be found here.
00:54:22 Castles, some dating
00:54:24 from the 16th century, are popular sites.
00:54:28 This is Nesvizh Castle.
00:54:31 If you look up at the ceiling of its chapel, you’ll see Jehovah’s name
00:54:36 in the form of the Tetragrammaton.
00:54:40 When Belarus was part of the Soviet Union,
00:54:44 Jehovah’s Witnesses faced strong government opposition.
00:54:49 Some of our brothers were exiled to far-away Siberia.
00:54:54 Today, more than 6,000 publishers
00:54:58 in 84 congregations boldly declare the good news
00:55:02 in Belarus.
00:55:05 There is a zealous pioneer spirit here.
00:55:07 Twenty percent of the publishers
00:55:11 are in full-time service.
00:55:14 This is how our brothers share the good news
00:55:17 in the city of Brest.
00:55:18 They enjoy many aspects
00:55:21 of public witnessing.
00:55:23 Here are our brothers and sisters in the city of Kobryn.
00:55:28 Their territory includes both urban and rural areas.
00:55:33 The 78 publishers here conduct an average
00:55:37 of 74 Bible studies each month.
00:55:42 Our brothers and sisters in Belarus
00:55:44 send you their warm love and greetings.
00:55:50 Herman, it’s been a pleasure reviewing this exciting material
00:55:55 about the “king of the north” with you.
00:55:56 Thank you, Ken.
00:55:59 This information is so important.
00:56:03 It helps all of us
00:56:05 to face the future with confidence.
00:56:08 Before we say goodbye, we have a treat for you.
00:56:12 Here’s a preview of the video drama from this year’s convention.
00:56:17 Please enjoy.
00:56:36 You will receive training
00:56:39 in the house of the great King Nebuchadnezzar.
00:56:42 Wait!
00:56:44 Daniel!
00:56:49 Be strong, my son.
00:56:53 This is a new land with new laws.
00:56:55 Soon they’ll want us to worship their gods.
00:56:58 Jehovah is in Israel.
00:57:01 We’re in Babylon now.
00:57:08 What’s going to happen to us?
00:57:12 He had a dream,
00:57:13 and no one can tell him what it is.
00:57:14 Everyone is to be executed by dawn.
00:57:17 We have until morning.
00:57:19 To do what?
00:57:21 It’s Jerusalem.
00:57:24 They burned down Jehovah’s house!
00:57:27 As long as Jehovah exists,
00:57:30 we have hope.
00:57:32 Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.
00:57:35 He knows your dream and what it means.
00:57:38 Where is your God?
00:57:42 Kill them!
00:57:43 O Jehovah,
00:57:45 surely you didn’t bring us here to die.
00:57:48 Please, vindicate yourself.
00:58:01 As we’ve discussed in our program,
00:58:04 Daniel played an important role as Jehovah’s prophet.
00:58:08 And as we’ll see in our video drama,
00:58:11 there’s much we can learn from his life and example.
00:58:15 And now, before we sign off,
00:58:18 we have a special musical gift video
00:58:21 that closely relates to our monthly program theme.
00:58:25 You will be encouraged and inspired.
01:02:41 Please keep our brothers in Russia in your prayers.
01:02:45 Learn from their example of faith and courage.
01:02:48 See these events for what they are
01:02:51 —the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.
01:02:54 Let this knowledge move you to make wise decisions.
01:02:59 Stay faithful, and stay busy
01:03:02 as the end of this system draws close.
01:03:05 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:03:09 this is JW Broadcasting.

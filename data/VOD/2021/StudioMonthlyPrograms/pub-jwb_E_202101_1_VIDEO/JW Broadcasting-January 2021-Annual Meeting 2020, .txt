00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:03 This is JW Broadcasting®
00:00:05 for January 2021.
00:00:27 On Saturday, October 3,
00:00:29 the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
00:00:31 of Pennsylvania
00:00:33 held its annual business meeting
00:00:35 via videoconferencing.
00:00:37 In normal times, after we care for that necessary business,
00:00:42 we share spiritual encouragement in a larger meeting.
00:00:46 However, we’re not living in normal times.
00:00:51 Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
00:00:55 we had to readjust our plans.
00:00:57 However, the good news is,
00:01:00 we did not cancel the spiritual portion of the program.
00:01:06 You likely already enjoyed Brother Herd’s talk
00:01:09 in October about the 2021 yeartext.
00:01:13 If not, we encourage you to do so.
00:01:17 In addition, the Governing Body assigned me
00:01:20 to be the chairman for the 2020 annual meeting,
00:01:24 and I’ll also be the anchor for this month’s and next month’s
00:01:28 JW Broadcasting programs.
00:01:31 We’re happy that in this month’s broadcast,
00:01:34 you’ll see the first part
00:01:36 of that spiritual portion of the annual meeting.
00:01:39 It begins with a special musical prelude.
00:01:43 Please enjoy!
00:12:31 Annual meetings of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:12:36 have been held for many years
00:12:38 —in fact, since January 1885.
00:12:42 They have been held in different states in the United States
00:12:45 and, in 1983, in Britain.
00:12:49 This year, 2020, the corporate meeting
00:12:52 is being held by videoconference.
00:12:55 The spiritual program has been recorded
00:12:57 for the benefit of the brothers all over the earth.
00:13:00 This is a historic annual meeting.
00:13:05 In the past, we have had some historic annual meetings.
00:13:10 For example,
00:13:12 at the annual meeting held on October 2, 1944, in Pittsburgh,
00:13:17 the members of the Pennsylvania corporation
00:13:19 adopted six resolutions amending its charter.
00:13:23 The charter had provided that voting shares be issued
00:13:27 to contributors of funds to the Society’s work,
00:13:31 but the third amendment eliminated that provision.
00:13:35 Thereafter, directors of the Society were to be voted into office
00:13:40 by individuals who were fully devoted to Jehovah,
00:13:45 irrespective of the amount of money that they contributed
00:13:49 to advance the Kingdom work.
00:13:52 After the historic annual meeting in 1944,
00:13:56 a vital question remained.
00:14:00 Since the Governing Body was then closely identified
00:14:03 with the Pennsylvania corporation’s seven-member board of directors,
00:14:08 did this mean that the Governing Body
00:14:11 could never be made up of more than seven anointed Christians?
00:14:17 Moreover, since the directors
00:14:20 are elected by the members of the corporation,
00:14:23 were the corporation members electing members of the Governing Body
00:14:28 at the annual meeting each year?
00:14:31 Are the directors and officers
00:14:33 of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:14:38 and the members of the Governing Body
00:14:40 one and the same, or are they different?
00:14:45 These questions were answered years later.
00:14:48 They were answered at the annual meeting held
00:14:50 on October 1, 1971
00:14:54 —another historic annual meeting.
00:14:58 On that occasion, one of the speakers pointed out
00:15:01 that the governing body preceded
00:15:04 the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:15:08 by hundreds of years.
00:15:11 Now, despite some who opposed Jehovah
00:15:15 and the earthly part of his organization
00:15:17 and who claimed there was no governing body in the first century
00:15:20 and hence saw no need for a Governing Body today,
00:15:24 a governing body was formed at Pentecost of 33 C.E.,
00:15:28 more than 18 centuries
00:15:30 before the Pennsylvania corporation came into existence.
00:15:36 At first, the governing body consisted of 12 apostles.
00:15:41 Its number was enlarged later,
00:15:44 for “the apostles and older men in Jerusalem” were taking the lead.
00:15:48 Now notice what happened later
00:15:52 here in the Bible book of Acts
00:15:55 in chapter 15.
00:15:57 So other issues had been handled by the 12 apostles,
00:16:01 but now with this circumcision issue
00:16:04 that came up among the congregations,
00:16:08 notice what we read here in verse 2 of Acts 15:
00:16:12 “But after quite a bit of dissension and disputing
00:16:16 “by Paul and Barnabas with them,
00:16:19 “it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others
00:16:23 “to go up to the apostles
00:16:26 “and elders in Jerusalem
00:16:28 regarding this issue.”
00:16:31 So the issue was going to be settled by the first-century governing body.
00:16:35 And now it’s larger than the apostles;
00:16:39 it included the elders and the apostles
00:16:43 in Jerusalem.
00:16:45 Now, what is the benefit
00:16:47 of following the direction from the governing body in the first century
00:16:51 and, by extension, today?
00:16:54 Notice that at Acts 16:4, 5,
00:16:58 they’re carrying the decree there.
00:17:00 And it mentions: “As they traveled on through the cities,
00:17:03 “they would deliver to them for observance
00:17:07 “the decrees that had been decided on
00:17:09 “by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.
00:17:14 “[Now notice.]
00:17:16 “Then, indeed, the congregations
00:17:19 “continued to be made firm in the faith
00:17:21 and to increase in number day by day.”
00:17:26 Isn’t that beautiful?
00:17:28 There was a governing body.
00:17:30 They didn’t have a need for legal entities
00:17:33 to advance the Kingdom work in the first century,
00:17:37 but they did indeed need a governing body.
00:17:42 As long as conditions in this world permit,
00:17:46 the Governing Body will make use of legal entities.
00:17:49 If a legal entity is dissolved by government decree,
00:17:53 the preaching work will still go on.
00:17:57 Even now, in lands where restrictions are in effect
00:18:00 and no legal entities are used,
00:18:03 the Kingdom message is being proclaimed,
00:18:06 disciples are being made,
00:18:08 and theocracy’s increase continues.
00:18:12 In the midst of this pandemic, the preaching continues.
00:18:17 Many experiences are happening globally.
00:18:20 Now, one I received and confirmed
00:18:23 from two elders serving at Warwick Bethel,
00:18:26 I think you’ll appreciate.
00:18:28 So much is going on and so many nice experiences.
00:18:31 A health-care system that operates
00:18:34 dozens of hospitals across the United States,
00:18:37 and many of them were COVID hot spots,
00:18:40 wanted to publish a video interview
00:18:43 featuring two frontline health-care workers in one of the hospitals.
00:18:48 Well, it happened that the two nurses they chose for the interviews
00:18:52 were our brothers.
00:18:54 They were asked to supply pictures of their families.
00:18:57 One of the pictures had been taken before the pandemic
00:19:00 in front of a paradise scene in one of our Assembly Halls.
00:19:04 Now, the woman coordinating the video interviews
00:19:07 told the brother that she recognized that scene.
00:19:11 So he asked her if she was a Witness.
00:19:15 She replied: “No, but I studied with the Witnesses,
00:19:18 “and I know it’s the truth.
00:19:21 I can see how close we are to the end.”
00:19:25 The brother then told her that she’d be happy to know
00:19:29 that the second nurse whom she had interviewed the day before
00:19:33 was also a Witness.
00:19:35 Then the woman burst into tears.
00:19:39 She said it made sense that the two nurses selected for this interview
00:19:44 would both be Witnesses.
00:19:47 “I can see it in your approach
00:19:49 and in the belief in something bigger than this.”
00:19:53 And she said she planned to resume her Bible study.
00:19:57 So we pray for this woman and all the wonderful experiences happening
00:20:02 as the preaching goes on during this pandemic.
00:20:05 So this is all happening because Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:20:09 plant and water
00:20:11 and “God [keeps] making it grow.”
00:20:14 All glory goes to Jehovah.
00:20:18 At this meeting, as was pointed out last year
00:20:22 with the announcement about the Ramapo project,
00:20:25 you will learn that the faithful slave is not slowing down.
00:20:29 We have more work to do until Jehovah says
00:20:33 the preaching work is finished.
00:20:37 As we look to the future, we are confident
00:20:39 that Jehovah will care for the spiritual and material needs of his people.
00:20:44 He and his Son, Jesus Christ, will continue to provide
00:20:47 the heavenly direction and support needed
00:20:50 to complete the Kingdom preaching work.
00:20:53 We therefore beg Jehovah for his spirit
00:20:56 to finish the work he has given us.
00:21:02 While Jehovah’s organization here on earth
00:21:04 is legally established and abides by governmental requirements
00:21:09 for its business meetings,
00:21:11 this organization is bound by a higher power.
00:21:15 Before he left the earth, Jesus told his followers:
00:21:18 “Go . . . make disciples . . . , teaching them.”
00:21:23 But he did even more.
00:21:25 Jesus promised that during the time of the end,
00:21:28 we would also receive “food at the proper time”
00:21:31 to help us fulfill that commission.
00:21:34 Has Jesus kept his promise?
00:21:37 Please watch the following video.
00:21:40 It is entitled “Go, . . . Teaching Them.”
00:21:50 Everyone who claims to be a Christian
00:21:53 and has dedicated himself to Jehovah God
00:21:56 must not only preach
00:21:59 but he must be able to teach.
00:22:02 We must go into the homes of the people
00:22:04 and teach them what the Bible says.
00:22:12 We needed a book that could be used
00:22:14 effectively in conducting Bible studies,
00:22:17 one that would cover
00:22:18 the basic doctrines and truths.
00:22:22 Many years ago
00:22:23 in the Bethel dining room
00:22:25 after the noon meal,
00:22:27 Brother Knorr read off a list of 15 to 20 brothers’ names
00:22:30 who were to report at his office immediately.
00:22:32 And they were told to write
00:22:34 a new study book using simple, everyday language,
00:22:38 just as they would present basic Bible truths
00:22:40 to someone at the door.
00:22:41 Well, within months, that book was written,
00:22:44 printed, and released
00:22:47 as “Let God Be True.”
00:22:49 That book made even
00:22:51 a new publisher feel confident.
00:22:53 It was like having a ‘bombshell’ in our hands,
00:22:56 capable of blowing to bits all of the false doctrines.
00:23:00 At one house, I conducted studies in that book
00:23:03 for 15 years with different people!
00:23:06 First, a woman;
00:23:08 next, a family;
00:23:11 then, some young people;
00:23:14 finally, another woman —six people in all
00:23:17 got baptized using that book.
00:23:23 Still, some struggled to finish this
00:23:25 and the even more detailed ‘Impossible to Lie ’ book
00:23:28 and to make progress.
00:23:30 By the late 1960’s,
00:23:32 a book was needed that got right to the point.
00:23:37 They called it the “blue bomb.”
00:23:39 And it was a game changer
00:23:41 —a game changer.
00:23:43 It was written in a simple, clear,
00:23:47 and pointed way so that any sincere reader
00:23:50 could understand it.
00:23:54 I used to deal drugs.
00:23:56 I wanted to change, but I didn’t know how.
00:23:59 Then, my manager gave me the Truth  book.
00:24:02 I was immediately convinced
00:24:04 I had found the truth and the real meaning of life.
00:24:08 From then on,
00:24:09 everyone who came looking for drugs
00:24:12 got a Truth  book instead!
00:24:16 By the early 1980’s,
00:24:18 the field needed something new.
00:24:21 Could a book be produced at the same level as the Bible Stories  book
00:24:25 but with the information presented in the Truth  book?
00:24:30 I had no Bible studies at all.
00:24:33 Now, I have three,
00:24:35 and a fourth one is ready to start.
00:24:37 Thank you!
00:24:41 I was studying with a man who had been smoking for 17 years.
00:24:46 Then he started to read the Live Forever  book.
00:24:48 That did it.
00:24:50 Any book that powerful shouldn’t go to waste sitting on the shelf.
00:24:56 Only a decade later, the world had changed.
00:25:00 In some lands, so many wanted to study
00:25:03 that they were put on a waiting list.
00:25:05 Other lands faced a different problem.
00:25:07 Somehow, we dillydally with some of our students.
00:25:11 [It] takes us years to bring some into the truth,
00:25:14 and we wonder why.
00:25:16 Maybe this book,
00:25:18 with its pointed truths,
00:25:20 will open their minds
00:25:21 and their hearts to see.
00:25:23 The Live Forever  book helped me to love Jehovah,
00:25:26 but the Knowledge  book
00:25:28 helped me to make the decision to serve him.
00:25:33 My husband studied the Knowledge  book
00:25:35 while he was working in Poland.
00:25:37 He loved it so much that he translated it
00:25:40 into Mongolian and sent it to us.
00:25:43 Soon we were all baptized.
00:25:46 My husband then joined
00:25:48 the real Mongolian translation team.
00:25:52 Still, we needed a book
00:25:54 that not only sped up disciple-making
00:25:56 but also touched the heart.
00:26:06 This book has an instant appeal
00:26:08 that quickly draws householders
00:26:10 into a conversation.
00:26:12 Some are calling it the Gold Nugget!
00:26:16 I was searching for something to fill
00:26:18 the emptiness that we both felt in our lives.
00:26:21 I was being trained by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:26:24 and she said, “Feel free to read whatever I have in my toolbox.”
00:26:28 I opened it, and immediately a little yellow book,
00:26:31 What Does the Bible Really Teach?, caught my eye.
00:26:33 The scriptures at the beginning of the book,
00:26:36 they touched my heart immediately,
00:26:38 and I felt like,
00:26:40 ‘These answer all the questions
00:26:42 I’ve been searching for my entire life!’
00:26:52 . . . publication entitled What Can the Bible Teach Us?
00:27:04 It was like having a ‘bombshell’ in our hands.
00:27:08 It really touched the heart,
00:27:11 and it helped bring many into the truth.
00:27:14 I found answers to all my questions
00:27:17 in just one book.
00:27:20 This book was sent from God.
00:27:24 The best teaching tool
00:27:26 I’ve ever been privileged to use.
00:27:30 We thought this was the book
00:27:32 —the only book—
00:27:34 and that there never could be another.
00:27:40 Many of you have used every one
00:27:43 of those publications over the years.
00:27:46 Like me, you have felt that each one was a great instrument for its time.
00:27:50 But we’re not stuck in the past.
00:27:53 We look to the future.
00:27:57 What is the future of disciple-making?
00:28:00 Listen as Brother David Splane delivers the talk
00:28:04 “Wouldn’t It Be Great . . .?”
00:28:10 The yeartext for 2020 was about the preaching work:
00:28:14 “Go . . . make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”
00:28:18 Now, in harmony with that theme, the Governing Body directed
00:28:22 that a number of study articles should be prepared
00:28:25 for the study edition of The Watchtower
00:28:27 about the ministry and particularly about conducting Bible studies.
00:28:33 Then at the regional convention this summer,
00:28:35 why, almost the entirety of Saturday
00:28:38 was dedicated to the disciple-making work.
00:28:40 Why?
00:28:42 We don’t just want to report Bible studies;
00:28:46 we want to make disciples.
00:28:49 That’s what Jesus told us to do:
00:28:51 “Go . . . make disciples . . . ,
00:28:53 baptizing them.”
00:28:56 Now, when it comes to reporting Bible studies, we’re doing very well.
00:29:02 Worldwide, we’re reporting about ten million Bible studies.
00:29:07 And when you think of it, in many cases,
00:29:09 more than one person is sitting in on that study.
00:29:12 So it could be that between 12 and 15 million people
00:29:16 are studying the Bible with us.
00:29:19 But now, what about the “make disciples” part of it?
00:29:24 Well, every year, between 200 and 300 thousand people
00:29:28 are baptized.
00:29:30 So you can see that the “make disciples” part
00:29:33 is lagging behind the reporting Bible studies part.
00:29:38 Now, this trend has been a concern of the Governing Body for a number of years.
00:29:43 And we wondered,
00:29:44 ‘Why is it that so many people are not taking a stand for the truth?’
00:29:51 You can probably think of a number of reasons yourself.
00:29:54 Some people, for example, are quite happy to learn what the Bible teaches,
00:29:59 but they’re not willing to act on what the Bible teaches.
00:30:03 They’re not willing to make drastic changes in their life.
00:30:08 Some may have studied through a whole book or maybe two,
00:30:11 but they haven’t been to a single meeting
00:30:15 —maybe one, maybe the Memorial once.
00:30:19 Well, they make us think of something
00:30:24 that Jehovah told the Israelites
00:30:27 back in the days of Ezekiel.
00:30:29 I’d like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 33,
00:30:33 and we’re going to read verse 32.
00:30:36 Now, this was a description of the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day,
00:30:40 but I think you’ll find that the description fits pretty well
00:30:43 a few of our Bible students.
00:30:46 Ezekiel chapter 33 (I’ll give you a moment),
00:30:49 and we’re going to read verse 32:
00:30:54 “Look! You are to them like a romantic love song,
00:30:59 “sung with a beautiful voice
00:31:01 “and skillfully played on a stringed instrument.
00:31:04 “[But then notice this.]
00:31:06 “They will hear your words,
00:31:09 but no one will act on them.”
00:31:13 Doesn’t that describe some of our Bible students?
00:31:17 Or maybe the study isn’t regular; maybe it isn’t consistent.
00:31:22 Maybe the student often cancels
00:31:24 or maybe the publisher often cancels.
00:31:28 Well, if a study isn’t regular,
00:31:30 it’s pretty hard for the person to make progress, isn’t it?
00:31:34 And in many cases, kindhearted publishers
00:31:38 just can’t bring themselves to stop the study
00:31:41 when no progress is being made.
00:31:43 Or they may say: ‘If I stop the study, I won’t have a study.
00:31:48 I like having a Bible study.’
00:31:53 Well, we’re talking about progressive Bible studies, and that’s a challenge.
00:31:58 It’s not easy to conduct a progressive Bible study.
00:32:03 There are so many factors to consider.
00:32:05 For example: ‘How early do I bring in prayer?
00:32:09 ‘How do I direct interest to the organization?
00:32:13 ‘How early should I mention the meetings?
00:32:16 And what do I do if my Bible student doesn’t show up at the meeting?’
00:32:21 What about opposition?
00:32:23 That can be tricky.
00:32:25 Bring it up too soon, and you might scare him off.
00:32:28 Wait too long, and it may be too late.
00:32:32 And what about the ministry?
00:32:34 ‘How do I encourage my Bible student
00:32:38 ‘to share what he is learning with others?
00:32:41 ‘These are a lot of challenges,
00:32:43 ‘and don’t even mention helping my Bible student
00:32:47 to break a bad habit like smoking.’
00:32:49 Wouldn’t it be great if we could get some help
00:32:52 with some of these things?
00:32:54 Here’s more food for thought:
00:32:57 ‘How do I make sure that the material
00:32:59 ‘is really touching the student’s heart?
00:33:02 ‘I want that student to love Jehovah, to get to know Jehovah.
00:33:06 ‘I want him to have a warm personal relationship
00:33:10 ‘with Jehovah so that no one
00:33:12 ‘—neither the boss nor his relatives nor his mate nor his neighbor—
00:33:17 will be allowed to come between my student and Jehovah God.’
00:33:23 Here’s another thing for conducting a Bible study:
00:33:26 We want to focus on the Scriptures.
00:33:29 Jesus said: “The seed is the word of God.”
00:33:32 ‘So, now, how do I draw my student out
00:33:35 ‘as to his feelings about this scripture?
00:33:39 ‘Maybe he understands what the scripture says,
00:33:42 but how does he feel about what he is learning?’
00:33:45 Wouldn’t it be great
00:33:47 if some of those questions were prepared for us?
00:33:51 Bible students also have challenges in their personal life.
00:33:55 Wouldn’t it be great if we could bring someone
00:33:58 on our study who has gone through a similar situation as the students?
00:34:01 who understands what the student is going through?
00:34:04 That would really take the pressure off, wouldn’t it?
00:34:07 And how can you evaluate the progress of the student?
00:34:11 ‘How do I know if the student is steadily working
00:34:14 ‘toward becoming an unbaptized publisher
00:34:17 and then getting baptized?’
00:34:20 Here’s another thing:
00:34:22 One of the reasons why it takes so long for some to make progress
00:34:26 is that there are two books and a brochure to go through.
00:34:30 That’s a lot of reading.
00:34:32 And when you think of it, a lot of our students
00:34:34 have never opened a book since they left school.
00:34:36 So for them, this is a big change.
00:34:39 Some get baptized before they’ve covered the second book,
00:34:43 and that’s a pity because they’re losing out
00:34:46 on practical information on Christian living
00:34:49 that they really need to have.
00:34:51 And then some of our brothers and sisters
00:34:54 are not even using the Jehovah’s Will  brochure
00:34:57 to direct interest to the organization.
00:35:00 ‘The Jehovah’s Will  brochure? What’s that?’
00:35:02 Exactly!
00:35:04 Wouldn’t it be great if in just one book,
00:35:09 we could cover all of the basic doctrinal matters,
00:35:13 all of the matters about Christian living,
00:35:15 and direct people’s interest to the organization
00:35:19 —in just one book?
00:35:21 That truly would be great.
00:35:24 Well, maybe right now, you’re saying: ‘All right, I understand.
00:35:28 ‘We do need some help with this, but what are you doing about it?’
00:35:32 I’ll tell you.
00:35:34 In April 2018, the Service Committee of the Governing Body
00:35:38 surveyed the branches to find out what teaching methods
00:35:41 were really effective in bringing people along to baptism.
00:35:45 We have to admit that some of the study material and teaching methods
00:35:50 that were used 30 years ago were great for the time,
00:35:53 but they don’t necessarily meet the needs of people today.
00:35:57 Well, they got some good answers in.
00:35:59 And based on the answers, early in 2019, a team of brothers
00:36:04 —there were writers and there were designers and consultants—
00:36:08 they got together to investigate whether we could improve
00:36:11 on the tools that we’re using.
00:36:13 And they came up with a new method
00:36:16 for conducting studies.
00:36:19 Now, let’s stop here and be very clear.
00:36:23 We deeply appreciate all of the study material
00:36:27 that we’ve had over the years.
00:36:29 It’s always been great for the times.
00:36:31 Now, maybe like me, you cut your teeth on “Let God Be True,”
00:36:36 “This Means Everlasting Life,”
00:36:38 “The Truth Shall Make You Free,” —those books were just perfect
00:36:41 for the period just after World War II.
00:36:44 And then we know that the Live Forever  book
00:36:47 was a real favorite with many.
00:36:49 Now, it wasn’t the “Study Forever” book; it was the Live Forever  book.
00:36:54 But some took an awful long time to complete their study in that book.
00:36:59 And, of course, we’ve all appreciated
00:37:01 the Teach Us  book and the Remain in God’s Love  book.
00:37:05 All of this material has been very, very good.
00:37:09 But times change, and people’s needs change as well.
00:37:14 We’re living in a visual society,
00:37:17 and people learn less
00:37:19  by reading than by observing,
00:37:22 by watching, and by discussion.
00:37:25 So, what are we saying?
00:37:28 Are you ready?
00:37:32 Today, the Governing Body is happy to announce
00:37:36 that a brand new publication for conducting Bible studies
00:37:40 will soon be made available in printed form and in electronic form.
00:37:45 Would you like to know the title?
00:37:47 It’s a good one.
00:37:49 Enjoy Life Forever!
00:37:51 —An Interactive Bible Course.
00:38:01 The title is taken from Psalm 22:26:
00:38:04 “Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.
00:38:08 May you enjoy life forever.”
00:38:12 Isn’t that nice?
00:38:13 Isn’t that a nice text?
00:38:15 How was the course put together?
00:38:18 Well, the branches sent in all of their comments,
00:38:21 and they were good comments.
00:38:23 And then the writers got busy,
00:38:26 and they analyzed the comments
00:38:28 that were sent in by the branches.
00:38:32 And on the basis of those comments,
00:38:34 three sample lessons were prepared.
00:38:37 Now, the lessons look good on paper, but would they work in the field?
00:38:42 To find out, those lessons were sent
00:38:45 to 97 different countries
00:38:47 for field-testing,
00:38:49 and the results were very encouraging.
00:38:53 So all 60 lessons in the book
00:38:58 were sent to the field for testing.
00:39:03 Now, the question may come up: ‘Who are the testers?
00:39:07 ‘Did you get all the circuit overseers,
00:39:09 ‘the missionaries, the special pioneers together
00:39:12 and have them test the material?’
00:39:14 Well, there were some of those,
00:39:16 but not all were circuit overseers,
00:39:19 not all were missionaries, or special pioneers.
00:39:22 So a wide variety of brothers and sisters were used in this test.
00:39:27 Some were quite new in the truth,
00:39:29 and others had been in the truth for quite some time.
00:39:32 The result is the publication
00:39:36 that will soon be made available.
00:39:39 Now, what’s different about this course?
00:39:41 I’m not going to go into much detail
00:39:43 because Brother Jackson is going to handle that.
00:39:45 But here are a couple of points:
00:39:47 First of all, very important,
00:39:50 all of the information
00:39:52 that’s required to answer the 60 questions
00:39:55 for baptismal candidates is covered thoroughly in this book.
00:40:00 All of the information needed
00:40:04 —that is, Bible topics, Christian living topics,
00:40:08 directing interest to the organization—
00:40:11 is all thoroughly covered in just one book.
00:40:15 You do not, repeat,
00:40:17 you do not have to study a second book.
00:40:22 What’s the format like?
00:40:24 Well, it’s somewhat similar to the midweek Meeting Workbook,
00:40:28 and you’ll see that it’s organized in a way
00:40:31 that there can be a free discussion
00:40:33 between the student and the conductor.
00:40:36 In fact, in each lesson, there are just a few introductory paragraphs
00:40:41 that the student is invited to read ahead of time.
00:40:44 But most of the lesson will be handled
00:40:47 between the conductor and the student.
00:40:50 It will be a discussion.
00:40:53 The material will focus on the Scriptures.
00:40:56 A typical sentence might read:
00:40:59 ‘Read this scripture; then answer these questions.’
00:41:03 And the questions are provided.
00:41:06 The electronic copy of the book
00:41:08 has links to some 200 different videos
00:41:11 that you can view during the study.
00:41:15 Remember the problem of having somebody along on the study
00:41:19 who has gone through the same problems as the student has?
00:41:23 Problem solved.
00:41:24 You just look up a video interview and play that for the student.
00:41:29 And no doubt, he will glean a great deal of benefit from it.
00:41:34 At regular intervals,
00:41:36 tactful reference is made to sharing the truth with others.
00:41:39 A typical question,
00:41:41 ‘How would you explain what you just learned to a friend?’
00:41:46 At the end of every lesson,
00:41:48 the student is given a goal that he can work toward.
00:41:51 And that way, it will help him to evaluate his progress.
00:41:56 And Jehovah’s qualities are showcased throughout the book.
00:41:59 We want the student to realize
00:42:01 that Jehovah loves him very much
00:42:04 and that Jehovah’s feelings are influenced,
00:42:07 or affected, by the decisions that the student makes.
00:42:11 And that way, he will cultivate a warm,
00:42:14 personal relationship with Jehovah.
00:42:17 Well, we humans are creatures of habit, aren’t we?
00:42:22 We’ve used the simple question-and-answer method
00:42:25 for many, many years in conducting Bible studies.
00:42:28 And it has met the needs in the past.
00:42:31 But in our communication with the branches,
00:42:33 it has become obvious that something else is needed.
00:42:37 So ask Jehovah to help you to get used to this new method, and use it.
00:42:42 You’ll be glad you did.
00:42:44 We pray that Jehovah will bless our efforts to use this tool.
00:42:48 And wouldn’t it be great if when you use it,
00:42:52 you not only study with people but make disciples of them?
00:43:00 Thank you, Brother Splane.
00:43:03 What an exciting announcement!
00:43:06 Brother Splane asked,
00:43:08 ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you could make a disciple?’
00:43:12 That is a great thought.
00:43:15 How do you feel, though,
00:43:17 about learning this new way of conducting Bible studies?
00:43:21 Are you excited?
00:43:23 Are you eager to start, or are you a little uneasy?
00:43:30 Brother Geoffrey Jackson is going to help you see
00:43:33 how you can confidently use our new book on Bible studies.
00:43:38 His talk is entitled
00:43:40 “Yes, It Would Be Great, But . . .”
00:43:46 Wouldn’t it be great?
00:43:48 Yes, it would be great.
00:43:50 But we have a lot of questions, don’t we?
00:43:54 The first question is,
00:43:57 Did we hear that correctly
00:43:59 —that not only are we receiving a new publication
00:44:02 but we’re also starting a new method
00:44:06 of conducting Bible studies?
00:44:08 The answer is yes.
00:44:11 But why is that necessary?
00:44:14 Well, to answer that question,
00:44:17 let’s think of a few things that have changed in recent years.
00:44:21 For example, think about the New World Translation
00:44:26 and the revision of the New World Translation.
00:44:29 Was that revised
00:44:31 because the Reference Bible was no longer any good?
00:44:34 No.
00:44:36 We remember the explanation given:
00:44:39 that reading skills of people have changed.
00:44:43 No longer do people enjoy reading
00:44:47 and taking that slow journey
00:44:49 to eventually get to a destination.
00:44:52 But rather, in this modern age, we find that people
00:44:55 are wanting to get to the destination very quickly.
00:44:59 They want clear, simple explanations that give them the meaning quickly.
00:45:05 But what if when the Governing Body were considering
00:45:08 whether or not to revise the New World Translation
00:45:11 had said, ‘But we can’t do this
00:45:15 ‘because the brothers and sisters would have to learn a whole lot
00:45:19 ‘of new vocabulary and all their favorite scriptures
00:45:22 ‘they’d have to memorize again
00:45:24 ‘and they probably wouldn’t be able to find those verses
00:45:27 on the right page in the Bible.’
00:45:30 But the Governing Body didn’t decide that (not to have the revision).
00:45:35 But rather, we saw how Jehovah blessed
00:45:39 the revision of the New World Translation.
00:45:41 And haven’t we been happy
00:45:43 using this and getting the benefits from it?
00:45:47 But not only have reading skills changed
00:45:50 but also learning skills,
00:45:54 and that’s shown by some of the adjustments
00:45:57 that have been made to our midweek meeting.
00:46:00 Now we see our midweek meeting is fast-moving, it’s interesting,
00:46:05 and it seems so much easier to learn things about the Bible.
00:46:10 Recently, I was talking to a sister
00:46:13 who has been in the truth for about 65 years,
00:46:16 and she said concerning the midweek meeting,
00:46:19 “I have learned more about the Bible
00:46:22 in the last few years than in the previous 60 years.”
00:46:26 And isn’t that true?
00:46:29 But what if the Governing Body when they were considering this change
00:46:33 had said, ‘Well we can’t make that change
00:46:36 because the older brothers and sisters won’t be able to adapt to it.’
00:46:40 Aren’t we happy that the change was made?
00:46:44 Of course we are, because we can see the beautiful benefits
00:46:49 that have come from that change.
00:46:53 When we think about all these changes that have occurred,
00:46:57 we can see that it fulfills what Jehovah promised.
00:47:00 And if you turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah
00:47:04 —Isaiah chapter 60.
00:47:07 And let’s remind ourselves of what is said
00:47:10 in the beginning of verse 17.
00:47:13 Here Jehovah promises:
00:47:15 “Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,
00:47:19 “and instead of the iron I will bring in silver,
00:47:23 “instead of the wood, copper,
00:47:26 and instead of the stones, iron.”
00:47:29 Doesn’t this nicely describe the promise
00:47:32 that Jehovah has made to help us to keep improving
00:47:36 the various things that we’re doing with preaching the good news
00:47:40 and also our spiritual feeding programs?
00:47:42 Yes, things continue to improve.
00:47:46 But let’s also remember how verse 16 in the same chapter starts.
00:47:51 It says:
00:47:53 “And you will actually drink the milk of nations.”
00:47:57 We probably remember that The Watchtower
00:48:00 has helped us to understand that this ‘milk of the nations’
00:48:03 involves all the things that are being developed,
00:48:06 including modern technology.
00:48:08 And Jehovah’s people with Jehovah’s blessing
00:48:11 have used many of these modern things
00:48:14 to help us with teaching and preaching.
00:48:18 Yes, as Brother Splane said very accurately,
00:48:22 “Times change, and people’s needs change.”
00:48:27 And that’s very true.
00:48:29 As we’ve seen, reading skills have changed
00:48:32 and learning skills have too.
00:48:35 So for that reason, over the last few years,
00:48:39 our Bible study tools have changed slightly.
00:48:43 We’ve seen how they’ve become simpler and easier to use,
00:48:48 and many of us are using videos along with these publications.
00:48:53 But, of course, sometimes it gets a little complicated
00:48:56 because we’re not quite sure what video to show when.
00:49:00 How refreshing it was when we saw that the digital version
00:49:04 of the Good News  brochure had videos embedded in it!
00:49:08 So you’re able to tap on the video and have the right video at the right time
00:49:13 when you’re conducting a study.
00:49:15 Well, this new publication takes all of this experience
00:49:19 that we’ve gained from trying to enhance our Bible study tools,
00:49:23 and now we have something that will be very easy to use.
00:49:28 But what does the publication look like?
00:49:32 Brother Splane mentioned that it had been field-tested.
00:49:37 Those who have already used it
00:49:39 —what did they say about this new publication?
00:49:42 And how does the Governing Body feel about this new publication?
00:49:46 All those questions are answered in this video.
00:49:53 Jehovah has always given us
00:49:55 the right tool at the right time
00:49:58 to teach others.
00:50:01 And this new book is no exception.
00:50:09 How is this book organized?
00:50:13 Each lesson is divided into three parts.
00:50:17 How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?
00:50:20 You might encourage your student
00:50:22 to read the first part of a lesson in advance
00:50:24 and to note the questions in bold
00:50:27 and the key scriptures.
00:50:30 Begin each study by reading and discussing
00:50:33 the first part together.
00:50:36 Next, consider together
00:50:38 the “Dig Deeper” section.
00:50:41 Begin by reading the introductory statement,
00:50:43 which explains what follows,
00:50:45 and take note of the subheadings
00:50:48 that outline the main points.
00:50:50 Read the scriptures,
00:50:53 watch the provided videos together,
00:50:55 and then discuss how
00:50:57 the scriptures and videos
00:50:59 answer the related questions.
00:51:02 Discuss the artwork with the student.
00:51:06 Then follow with the questions
00:51:08 found in the “Some People Say” section.
00:51:12 Then, read the “Summary”
00:51:14 and discuss the “Review” questions.
00:51:17 Your student can enter the date
00:51:19 the lesson was completed.
00:51:22 Each lesson
00:51:24 provides a “Goal” for the student,
00:51:26 and the “Explore” section
00:51:28 offers additional content
00:51:29 that may be useful depending
00:51:31 on your student’s needs and interests.
00:51:34 Yes, this tool is very different.
00:51:37 Why was it designed this way?
00:51:39 It’s a lot like
00:51:41 the teaching used in our theocratic schools.
00:51:44 It is very interactive.
00:51:46 On the one hand,
00:51:48 the lessons are written in such a way
00:51:50 to really make the student think about what he is learning.
00:51:55 This tool has the ability
00:51:57 to involve the Bible student.
00:52:00 It shows them a video,
00:52:02 and then they have references they can look at.
00:52:04 But the way that it’s designed involves them.
00:52:08 And it’s really going to give them a good foundation.
00:52:13 On the other hand, the teacher can use the viewpoint questions
00:52:17 to draw out how the student really feels
00:52:21 about what he’s learning from God’s Word.
00:52:24 This is the most thoroughly
00:52:25 field-tested publication
00:52:27 that we have ever produced.
00:52:29 From writing the text
00:52:31 to simplifying the text
00:52:33 —polishing it, getting it ready—
00:52:35 it has been produced so that it can be translated
00:52:38 into many languages
00:52:40 so as to help people everywhere.
00:52:43 Yes, this tool is very different,
00:52:47 but is it effective?
00:52:50 Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands
00:52:52 tested the lessons.
00:52:54 What do they say about it?
00:52:56 I love the new layout.
00:52:58 It’s current, and it’s intuitive.
00:53:01 And the way the Bible truths are presented
00:53:04 —it’s very logical and easy to understand.
00:53:07 I think it’s going to be a game changer.
00:53:10 The “Dig Deeper” section is amazing.
00:53:12 It ensures that the teaching
00:53:14 comes directly from the Bible.
00:53:17 Because this part of the study
00:53:19 becomes a conversation,
00:53:21 the students answer right from their hearts,
00:53:23 which allows me to learn a lot more
00:53:25 about how they think and feel.
00:53:28 The new method really helps us
00:53:30 to convince the mind and reach the heart.
00:53:32 Most of all, it helps
00:53:34 both the teacher and the student
00:53:36 to focus on the Scriptures
00:53:38 rather than on the study aid.
00:53:40 We never heard anybody say
00:53:42 “the paragraph says”
00:53:43 because when they did answer the question,
00:53:45 they were expressing what
00:53:46 they really believed.
00:53:50 The lessons are both logical and concise.
00:53:53 The method is highly interactive.
00:53:57 The students not only respond
00:53:59 in their own words
00:54:00 but are also able to come
00:54:01 to the correct conclusions
00:54:03 all by themselves.
00:54:06 It helps me as the teacher to talk less,
00:54:09 and it helps the student
00:54:11 to express himself and to think.
00:54:14 And the videos elicited comments
00:54:16 (sometimes of even a personal nature)
00:54:18 that probably never would’ve come out
00:54:19 had it not been for the videos.
00:54:21 The aim is to get to know Jehovah,
00:54:23 to love Jehovah,
00:54:25 to learn what his will is for us
00:54:27 and to do that will,
00:54:28 and also to draw close to his organization.
00:54:32 I have been in full-time service
00:54:34 for over 50 years.
00:54:36 I conduct several Bible studies.
00:54:39 These lessons cannot be compared with others.
00:54:43 They are more effective and just what
00:54:45 we need for our times.
00:54:50 It equips them to explain to others
00:54:52 what they have learned.
00:54:54 And as a teacher,
00:54:56 that fills me with so much joy
00:54:59 that I am motivated to be zealous
00:55:01 and find more new Bible studies.
00:55:05 We are so excited about this new approach
00:55:07 to teaching Bible truths!
00:55:09 The main points stand out,
00:55:11 the application is clear,
00:55:12 and it’s easy to remember.
00:55:14 And everybody can benefit from it
00:55:16 —from those with little or no education
00:55:18 to those who are highly educated.
00:55:20 Our students are going to love
00:55:21 this new publication.
00:55:23 And we will too, as this will make us
00:55:25 better teachers of God’s Word
00:55:26 so as to make more disciples
00:55:28 before the end comes.
00:55:30 And how do members of the Governing Body
00:55:32 feel about this innovative approach?
00:55:36 This book has the potential to draw many honesthearted ones
00:55:39 into Jehovah’s organization
00:55:41 to serve alongside us in pure worship
00:55:44 and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.
00:55:47 Compared to all the Bible study tools we’ve used in the past,
00:55:51 this is gold.
00:55:53 And that’s what it’s all about —helping that student
00:55:56 build a close relationship with Jehovah.
00:55:59 And unquestionably,
00:56:01 this new publication, this marvelous gift from Jehovah,
00:56:05 will help us accomplish this worthy goal.
00:56:11 We humbly recognize that whatever tool we use,
00:56:15 only Jehovah can make it grow.
00:56:17 So we’re praying that Jehovah will grant success to this new tool
00:56:22 to build and make disciples of Christ.
00:56:26 We are not just preachers.
00:56:29 We are teachers.
00:56:32 We are disciple-makers.
00:56:35 This new book gives us what we need
00:56:38 to help others love Jehovah,
00:56:40 follow Christ,
00:56:42 get baptized,
00:56:44 and Enjoy Life Forever!
00:56:51 What a fantastic new publication!
00:56:55 I’m sure all of us are looking forward to using it.
00:56:58 But you may be thinking:
00:57:01 ‘How big is it? How many pages are there?’
00:57:05 Well, there are 256 pages,
00:57:09 and there are 60 lessons.
00:57:12 Well, you may be thinking:
00:57:15 ‘Will that be overwhelming to many people
00:57:18 ‘when we show them this new publication?
00:57:21 ‘Many of our Bible studies that we start
00:57:25 ‘do lessons 1 and 2, and then by 3, perhaps they stop studying.
00:57:30 ‘So if we’re using a large publication,
00:57:33 ‘could it be that it would be a waste of a publication
00:57:36 ‘if someone isn’t going to continue to study?
00:57:40 ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we also had something else
00:57:44 that would introduce this new study system?’
00:57:47 And that’s exactly what we’re happy to announce:
00:57:51 the release of a new brochure entitled
00:57:54 Enjoy Life Forever —Introductory Bible Lessons.
00:57:59 Now, this new brochure contains within it
00:58:03 the first three lessons of the new publication.
00:58:08 When you look at the back of this brochure,
00:58:11 you’ll notice that it’s designed similarly to the design of our tracts.
00:58:16 It has the questions: “Is it possible to enjoy life forever?
00:58:21 Would you say yes? no? maybe?”
00:58:26 The explanation that’s given below,
00:58:29 along with the scriptures, helps us then
00:58:31 to direct the attention to the first lesson in the brochure.
00:58:35 And this first lesson is entitled “How Can the Bible Help You?,”
00:58:40 the second lesson is “The Bible Gives Hope,”
00:58:44 and the third lesson, “Can You Trust the Bible?”
00:58:49 What a wonderful way to introduce this new publication!
00:58:54 So once we’ve gone through the brochure and finished the three lessons,
00:58:58 if someone shows that they really want to continue
00:59:01 in their Bible study, then we introduce them
00:59:04 to the larger publication and start at lesson 4.
00:59:09 Wow! That’s so exciting, isn’t it?
00:59:11 It will be very easy to use this
00:59:14 and also to use the electronic version,
00:59:17 which has been developed at the same time as the printed version.
00:59:21 With the electronic version in JW Library®,
00:59:23 you’ll be able to just tap the link and it will take you to the videos
00:59:28 or to the verses or to the reference material.
00:59:32 Isn’t that exciting?
00:59:34 I’m sure all of us are looking forward to being able to use this new brochure
00:59:39 and the new publication to start Bible studies.
00:59:43 But there’s still one question left,
00:59:45 Wouldn’t it be great if we can use these publications
00:59:50 to help other persons to become disciples,
00:59:53 yes, and to enjoy life forever?
00:59:59 Yes, that will be great, Brother Jackson!
01:00:02 Thank you.
01:00:04 It is exciting to have such an innovative new tool
01:00:08 to conduct Bible studies.
01:00:10 That first exposure to the introductory study brochure
01:00:15 was very helpful.
01:00:17 But you might be thinking:
01:00:19 ‘The video was presented so fast;
01:00:21 ‘it’s a blur in my mind.
01:00:24 ‘I’m not sure if I understand all of the features
01:00:27 or how the study is to progress.’
01:00:30 Well, take heart.
01:00:32 For one thing, you can watch that video over and over again
01:00:37 if you’d like.
01:00:39 But also, please know that more information
01:00:43 will be coming to help you assimilate
01:00:45 these new teaching techniques in the future.
01:00:51 What is next on our program?
01:00:54 Over the past few years, our annual meeting program has presented
01:00:58 a longer-than-usual animated edition
01:01:02 of Become Jehovah’s Friend.
01:01:04 It is always special.
01:01:07 This year is no exception.
01:01:10 We are pleased to present to you young ones
01:01:13 and all of you who are still young at heart
01:01:16 the new epic edition, entitled Jehovah Forgives.
01:01:20 Please enjoy the presentation.
01:01:35 It was Jesus’ last night with his apostles.
01:01:41 You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.
01:01:45 Soon, Jesus would be arrested.
01:01:49 It was going to be very hard for them.
01:01:53 All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night,
01:01:57 for it is written: “I will strike the shepherd,
01:01:59 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.”
01:02:03 They were going to run away and abandon Jesus.
01:02:07 But Peter said:
01:02:09 Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you,—
01:02:13 —“I will never be stumbled!”
01:02:15 Very good, Caleb!
01:02:17 Peter thought he was strong and would never make Jehovah sad.
01:02:23 I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today
01:02:27 until you have denied knowing me three times.
01:02:32 Cock-a-roo!
01:02:34 No, it’s cock-a-doodle-doo!
01:02:36 Nuh-uh. That’s not a rooster!
01:02:38 Hey, kids!
01:02:39 It’s not important how the rooster sounds.
01:02:42 I’ll never make Jehovah sad!
01:02:45 Me neither!
01:02:47 We know you’d never want to.
01:02:49 But Jesus knew Peter would be afraid.
01:02:52 And when you are afraid . . .
01:02:54 [Screeching brakes]
01:02:55 Oh, no! You’re late!
01:02:57 Hurry! Grab your bags!
01:03:01 Careful!
01:03:05 Love you kids! See you later!
01:03:07 Be good!
01:03:08 Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!
01:03:44 I’m home!
01:03:47 Uh, hello!
01:03:51 Anybody?
01:03:55 He had a rough day.
01:03:58 Aww, what happened?
01:04:07 Caleb, are you OK?
01:04:11 What if Jehovah doesn’t wanna be my Friend anymore?
01:04:16 Hmm.
01:04:19 Jehovah wants to be your Friend.
01:04:21 But if you did something bad, he wants you to tell.
01:04:28 OK.
01:04:29 So today at school, I was outside on the playground.
01:05:15 Hey, Caleb.
01:05:18 Oh, hey.
01:05:19 Uh, I was just, uh . . .
01:05:22 You can have it.
01:05:24 Wait!
01:05:25 I thought he can’t have it.
01:05:27 Yeah! Which is it?
01:05:29 Uh, I didn’t want it anyway.
01:05:33 But I thought the Bible says you can’t?
01:05:36 Uh, it says . . .
01:05:38 C’mon! What does it say?
01:05:40 Uh, I’m not sure.
01:05:42 But you came to my house the other day to talk about the Bible.
01:05:46 Don’t you remember?
01:05:49 Um, yeah.
01:05:50 Maybe that wasn’t me.
01:05:57 Uh, ha-ha.
01:06:02 Huh!
01:06:03 That was you, but you’re scared.
01:06:09 [Ringtone of a rooster crowing]
01:06:13 Hi, Honey.
01:06:15 Yeah, I can’t talk right now.
01:06:17 Can you give me a call back later?
01:06:24 That was a rough day.
01:06:29 Do you remember when Peter said he would never stumble?
01:06:34 Later that night,
01:06:36 Jesus was arrested.
01:06:40 Move it!
01:06:53 Peter loved him and wanted to help.
01:07:10 But doing the right thing isn’t always easy.
01:07:21 You too were with Jesus the Galilean!
01:07:26 Ah, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
01:07:37 Wait!
01:07:38 This is one of them!
01:07:44 I do not know the man!
01:08:02 Hey,  you follow Jesus!
01:08:04 I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?
01:08:09 I swear, I do not know the man!
01:08:11 [A rooster crows twice]
01:08:54 Peter knew the right thing to do.
01:08:56 But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.
01:09:07 Just like at school.
01:09:12 Yes.
01:09:15 Peter didn’t want to make that mistake ever again.
01:09:20 But he wondered if Jesus and Jehovah would still be his friends.
01:09:41 After Jesus was resurrected, he talked to Peter.
01:09:46 Simon, son of John,
01:09:49 do you love me?
01:09:51 Yes, Lord,
01:09:53 you know I have affection for you.
01:09:57 Jesus forgave him!
01:09:59 And so did Jehovah.
01:10:02 But Peter had to talk to Jesus.
01:10:05 If you upset Jehovah, what do you think you have to do?
01:10:10 Talk to Jehovah.
01:10:12 That’s right.
01:10:14 You need to pray to ask for forgiveness.
01:10:18 And Jesus showed Peter that he was forgiven
01:10:20 by giving him more work to do.
01:10:23 Shepherd my little sheep.
01:10:34 So why didn’t Peter give up when he made a mistake?
01:10:38 Because Jehovah forgives.
01:10:40 Hey, guys!
01:10:51 Oh, wait!
01:10:53 I’m gonna need to explain birthdays.
01:10:55 Can you help me?
01:10:57 Of course.
01:11:00 That was a masterful application
01:11:04 of a Bible example about Jehovah’s forgiveness.
01:11:08 Caleb got the point, and so did all of us.
01:11:12 Did you notice at the very end
01:11:16 that Caleb asked his father to help him explain our stand on birthdays?
01:11:22 Please look forward to an upcoming Video on Demand segment
01:11:26 where his father does just that.
01:11:30 And by the way,
01:11:32 we are making a poster available online.
01:11:41 And you’ll be happy to know that posters will be made available
01:11:45 for the other epic animation videos
01:11:47 of the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series.
01:11:53 The pandemic in 2020
01:11:55 changed the way we carried out true worship.
01:11:59 The Memorial last year was experienced in private homes,
01:12:03 our preaching methods were changed,
01:12:05 and our regional conventions
01:12:07 were transformed into prerecorded sessions.
01:12:11 But we were all cared for spiritually.
01:12:16 What was involved in making this all happen
01:12:19 so quickly and effectively?
01:12:21 Please watch our next video.
01:12:31 Twenty-twenty was a year of unprecedented change.
01:12:35 The coronavirus pandemic
01:12:37 has taken a grim toll around the world.
01:12:40 In some parts of the world, the coronavirus is . . .
01:12:43 beginning to spread more quickly.
01:12:49 This global pandemic has thrown the world
01:12:53 into a state of uncertainty.
01:12:58 On a global scale, it was unlike anything
01:13:01 Jehovah’s people had yet experienced in the 21st century.
01:13:06 Everyday life for many of us
01:13:09 has been disrupted in ways we might never have imagined.
01:13:17 We’ve made dramatic adjustments to our activities all over the world.
01:13:22 Learn how to use new apps like Skype®
01:13:25 and Zoom—what’s that?
01:13:28 It changed how we attended meetings,
01:13:31 engaged in the ministry, and visited with friends.
01:13:34 For some of us,
01:13:36 this may have been the very first time we ever held
01:13:39 a Memorial in our home.
01:13:42 And although attending in smaller groups may have been even closer
01:13:45 to how the Memorial was observed in earlier times,
01:13:49 for most modern-day servants of Jehovah,
01:13:52 this was likely a unique experience.
01:13:59 Then, during the summer,
01:14:01 we enjoyed a full convention program,
01:14:04 with talks delivered directly
01:14:05 from Governing Body members
01:14:07 and their helpers,
01:14:09 and in most cases,
01:14:10 again, streamed right into our homes.
01:14:20 Yes, despite the various challenges
01:14:22 and difficulties experienced in 2020,
01:14:25 Jehovah’s organization continued undaunted
01:14:29 providing the right food at the right time.
01:14:31 But why was this convention
01:14:34 unlike any other in our organization’s history?
01:14:38 What were the challenges?
01:14:40 And most important, what have been the benefits?
01:14:47 On March 11, 2020,
01:14:50 the World Health Organization
01:14:52 made the assessment
01:14:53 that COVID-19 could be characterized
01:14:56 as a pandemic.
01:14:57 At that point, we had no idea
01:15:00 as to what governments
01:15:01 were going to do worldwide.
01:15:02 Would they allow our brothers
01:15:04 to meet in Kingdom Halls?
01:15:06 Would they allow our brothers to meet in larger venues?
01:15:10 We had no idea whatsoever.
01:15:13 The Governing Body approved a letter to all branches
01:15:16 canceling all live conventions worldwide.
01:15:19 And the idea was for us to prerecord a program
01:15:23 that could be used in any location
01:15:27 around the world so that they would at least have
01:15:30 the program of the regional convention.
01:15:33 We wanted to ensure
01:15:34 that this spiritual food got out there
01:15:36 to all of our dear brothers and sisters.
01:15:39 More important, we wanted to make certain
01:15:42 that this program went forward, because it honors Jehovah.
01:15:46 He’s the Source of the joy that we have.
01:15:49 So, very quickly, speakers were each assigned two convention parts.
01:15:53 They had to prepare them,
01:15:54 and it was scheduled to have all these talks
01:15:56 recorded during the last two weeks of April.
01:15:59 Giving a talk at an open arena
01:16:02 or at a large event,
01:16:04 you have the opportunity of getting
01:16:07 feedback from the audience.
01:16:09 If you say something that impresses the audience
01:16:12 or makes them happy, seeing the smiling faces there,
01:16:15 somehow that really stirs up our presentation
01:16:18 and helps us to make it more lively and meaningful.
01:16:22 But being in the basement of the office building,
01:16:26 looking at a camera with nobody else in the room,
01:16:30 knowing that it’s just a couple of persons
01:16:32 recording it in another room certainly is
01:16:36 a very different way to present a talk.
01:16:39 And Jehovah has allowed us to endure this time of pandemic,
01:16:44 but he also had to know —and we’re convinced he knew—
01:16:49 that we could still make this “Always Rejoice”! program happen
01:16:54 because we would use the tools available to us, and he would help us.
01:16:58 And that’s exactly what we did.
01:17:06 Next, let’s take a closer look at some additional challenges faced
01:17:09 once the talks were recorded.
01:17:12 We had the opportunity to hear from some of the departments involved.
01:17:17 Brothers,
01:17:19 how did the team adapt to the challenges?
01:17:22 Well, the reaction, initially, was that we were very excited.
01:17:26 We love to try new things,
01:17:28 and this was a huge opportunity
01:17:29 to do just that.
01:17:31 But then as we had more meetings about it,
01:17:33 we found out what was going to be involved.
01:17:35 We suddenly got very nervous
01:17:37 because we found out about all the translation
01:17:39 and how soon everything had to be finished.
01:17:41 What impact did that have?
01:17:43 Audio/Video Services had never produced
01:17:46 an online program of this size before.
01:17:48 You’re talking
01:17:49 an 18-hour online regional convention that had to be produced
01:17:53 in a very short time.
01:17:54 Most years,
01:17:55 we just translate the outlines,
01:17:57 which are relatively easy,
01:17:58 and then we translate
01:18:00 all the convention videos and dramas.
01:18:03 But this year,
01:18:04 the translators not only had to do that work of translating the videos
01:18:08 but they had to translate the scripts for each talk and then arrange
01:18:13 for recording all of those talks.
01:18:16 It was a tremendous amount of work.
01:18:18 Some of us were saying:
01:18:20 “Can we postpone it?
01:18:21 “Can we ask
01:18:22 “to write back and say,
01:18:24 ‘Brothers, please, can we do it later?’”
01:18:27 because we just thought
01:18:28 it was impossible to do.
01:18:31 The government in India
01:18:33 had announced a complete lockdown,
01:18:35 so overnight
01:18:37 we were without our offices,
01:18:39 our computer equipment,
01:18:41 our recording studios,
01:18:43 the level of connectivity we enjoyed.
01:18:46 We felt like a carpenter who’s asked to produce furniture
01:18:52 but has no access to his toolbox or his workshop.
01:18:57 That is a lot to contend with.
01:19:00 What are some unique solutions
01:19:03 that the teams came up with to meet those various challenges?
01:19:07 Well, there were amazing solutions.
01:19:10 One of the things that impressed me
01:19:12 was the recording studios that were made.
01:19:22 Normally the translators go into the RTO
01:19:23 or the branch to do the recording,
01:19:27 but now they had to make hundreds of makeshift studios in their homes.
01:19:31 How would translators accomplish the work
01:19:34 outside the branch with the power coming in and out?
01:19:37 Well, the brothers would wait,
01:19:40 and as soon as the power came, they would start working,
01:19:44 no matter what time it was in the day.
01:19:47 Our brothers are so dedicated that they accomplished the work.
01:19:52 Very touching.
01:19:54 Our brothers who do sign language recordings
01:19:56 had to record
01:19:57 in front of a camera,
01:19:59 but they also ideally needed
01:20:00 to have a background behind them
01:20:04 that was bright green or bright blue
01:20:09 so that their signing could be superimposed
01:20:11 onto another video.
01:20:13 And so some brothers were able to get a cloth.
01:20:16 Many of our brothers painted a wall in their house
01:20:20 this bright chartreuse color.
01:20:22 Admirable ingenuity—thank you.
01:20:24 One of the most interesting solutions
01:20:26 was that many of the translators around the world
01:20:30 in different branches would go
01:20:32 into their car late at night
01:20:34 when all the noise had subsided
01:20:37 in the neighborhood, and they would do the recording
01:20:39 inside the car.
01:20:41 Thank you and everyone working with you for being so willing to adapt.
01:20:45 In your opinion,
01:20:47 what made all of this possible?
01:20:50 Despite a global pandemic,
01:20:52 despite a lockdown
01:20:54 —none of those things
01:20:55 mattered to Jehovah’s organization.
01:20:57 What has shut down various other things throughout the world
01:21:01 proved to be no obstacle for Jehovah and his earthly organization.
01:21:06 And what a beautiful thing it is
01:21:08 to see this program be something that’s enjoyed by everyone worldwide!
01:21:13 Here, despite the conditions going on in the world around us,
01:21:17 Jehovah’s people are moving forward.
01:21:19 And you really see the fulfillment of Malachi 3:18,
01:21:23 where it says that ‘you will see a distinction
01:21:25 between those serving Jehovah and those who don’t.’
01:21:29 Everyone who had a part in this
01:21:31 —the thousands of brothers and sisters around the world
01:21:34 who had a part in bringing these convention programs
01:21:37 to our brothers and sisters—
01:21:39 they’re just normal people like you and me,
01:21:42 but Jehovah uses normal people
01:21:45 to accomplish incredible things.
01:21:48 This convention has been a landmark convention
01:21:52 because of the content and the beautiful theme,
01:21:55 but we’ll also remember it for the way Jehovah helped us
01:21:59 to produce it in so many languages
01:22:02 for our brothers and sisters in the country and around the world.
01:22:06 Well, in translation, we like verbs,
01:22:09 and in Jehovah’s name, there’s a verb:
01:22:12 “He Causes to Become.”
01:22:15 This 2020 convention was proof
01:22:19 that Jehovah causes whatever he wants
01:22:23 to become to accomplish his purpose,
01:22:26 because if there’s a convention that Jehovah used
01:22:29 to give glory to his name, this is it.
01:22:33 What beautiful conviction!
01:22:35 Thank you, brothers.
01:22:39 Yes, Jehovah’s spirit helped ensure
01:22:41 that the work was accomplished in spite of many challenges,
01:22:45 but what were some of the blessings experienced once the work was done?
01:22:56 Because the convention is being presented by means of video,
01:22:59 it’s possible to pause at any time when necessary
01:23:02 just to go back a little bit to watch something
01:23:04 that maybe we didn’t quite get.
01:23:06 And maybe even because sometimes our minds drift,
01:23:09 it’s good, because we can go back and rewatch it.
01:23:11 And in this way, we get even more benefit from the program.
01:23:18 I cannot imagine
01:23:20 a convention more international than this one.
01:23:23 We saw how the brothers were able
01:23:25 to make a difficult situation turn out well
01:23:27 —that is, we’re together,
01:23:30 even if we’re physically apart from each other.
01:23:32 We are united at this convention.
01:23:45 Volunteers were sent by the elders to travel
01:23:48 and obtain the videos due to lack of Internet in our village.
01:23:54 We traveled about 46 kilometers on foot.
01:24:02 Sometimes we would leave early in the morning
01:24:04 or late in the evening,  even traveling at night
01:24:07 in order to obtain the videos.
01:24:09 But with Jehovah’s blessing, we overcame
01:24:13 all of these challenges.
01:24:23 I lost my dearest wife
01:24:25 about two months before the convention started.
01:24:28 It was cancer.
01:24:31 We had been married for 14 years,
01:24:33 and she was only 47.
01:24:38 She was my greatest partner in Jehovah’s service,
01:24:42 so this left me with a gaping hole.
01:24:52 The theme of the convention, “Always Rejoice”!
01:24:56 came just at the right time for me.
01:24:59 I know it was Jehovah’s wonderful gift to me.
01:25:03 Throughout the convention, I could see that Jehovah had sent
01:25:06 all the members of the Governing Body and its helpers to me personally.
01:25:11 I can’t think of a better gift.
01:25:21 I really enjoyed the audio descriptions
01:25:25 because I am someone who is legally blind,
01:25:28 and the audio descriptions just opened up a whole new world for me.
01:25:32 Ben walks out of the room as his coworkers shake their heads.
01:25:39 So it was really amazing to have the videos being described.
01:25:44 And for me, I felt like I could now “see”
01:25:49 what was happening.
01:25:51 A lot of what the audio descriptions described
01:25:54 are things that I normally would have been curious about
01:25:58 and would have been asking somebody to help me understand.
01:26:01 I had tears in my eyes
01:26:04 knowing that the Governing Body loves us this much.
01:26:11 I speak Korean.
01:26:14 I speak Japanese.
01:26:17 We made a Japanese section and a Korean section
01:26:20 like what we would have at international conventions.
01:26:23 In order to watch the convention simultaneously, we would count
01:26:27 one, two, three and start playing our videos at the same time.
01:26:31 This way we were able to watch and sing together.
01:26:34 It really felt like an international convention.
01:26:38 Something that I thought I would miss a lot were the Kingdom melodies.
01:26:41 So then I wondered: ‘How is this going to work at home?
01:26:44 ‘There won’t be a crowd, everyone singing together.
01:26:47 How’s it going to be?’
01:26:49 I thought I would really miss it, but then my family and I agreed
01:26:52 to sing the Kingdom melodies loudly, and it worked!
01:26:55 I have never seen my family sing so loudly.
01:27:07 We have three children, and all five of us
01:27:11 here at home got COVID-19.
01:27:13 And all during the time that the convention was being shown,
01:27:16 we were all exhibiting symptoms.
01:27:18 It was a really hard time.
01:27:20 Our family was so encouraged by the convention program this year.
01:27:25 My wife, Marisa, even said that to her,
01:27:28 it was as if the talks the brothers gave
01:27:30 were like hearing advice from a close friend
01:27:32 who was sitting right next to you
01:27:34 like they were right in the same room with us.
01:27:41 The convention is very positive;
01:27:45 it’s contagious.
01:27:47 It has really touched our hearts.
01:27:49 I truly feel the convention has touched my heart deeply.
01:27:53 Both my mom and my dad, who are right now struggling
01:27:57 with very serious illnesses,
01:28:00 were able to join me,
01:28:02 my brother, and my sister-in-law,
01:28:04 and we were together as a family in our living room.
01:28:08 We got to sing together and watch the assembly together,
01:28:13 which otherwise just would not have been possible.
01:28:16 Despite the struggles,
01:28:18 despite the limitations
01:28:21 that we may be facing,
01:28:23 none of that has stopped Jehovah from reaching out
01:28:27 and even being in our own living rooms during this convention.
01:28:33 Jehovah transforms something
01:28:35 that Satan is using right now to take away our joy
01:28:39 into something that gives us joy.
01:28:41 Think about it:
01:28:43 We’re watching the same spiritual program
01:28:46 at the same time with the same speakers, brothers from the Governing Body.
01:28:50 We never imagined that we would have this opportunity.
01:28:55 OK, are we all set?
01:29:06 OK, we’re ready whenever you are if you want to go ahead.
01:29:12 We are delighted that you could join us for this opening session
01:29:15 of the “Always Rejoice”! Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:29:22 And when everything around you is chaotic,
01:29:25 the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.
01:29:33 “I will walk in your truth.
01:29:37 Unify my heart to fear your name.”
01:30:09 But we discovered something we had lost
01:30:12 —joy.
01:30:23 No matter what terror, no matter what trial may come upon us now
01:30:27 or in the future, we will be able to continue to rejoice
01:30:31 in Jehovah’s acts of salvation.
01:30:41 While 2020 seemed to be anything but a time for rejoicing,
01:30:45 this year’s convention proved
01:30:48 that no matter what the circumstance we are in,
01:30:51 Jehovah will continue to feed us,
01:30:53 and we will continue to worship him.
01:30:58 Thanks to Jehovah, we experienced
01:31:01 the truthfulness of Philippians 4:4,
01:31:06 that no matter the trail or difficulty,
01:31:09 we will “always rejoice in the Lord.”
01:31:27 Despite changing circumstances, what can we say?
01:31:31 Jehovah lived up to the meaning of his name:
01:31:34 “He Causes to Become.”
01:31:37 Things happened in quick succession
01:31:40 with the support of his will and holy spirit.
01:31:43 Now back to our studio.
01:31:48 How encouraging!
01:31:51 The second part of the program
01:31:53 will be released on January 18
01:31:56 in the Video on Demand section of JW Broadcasting.
01:32:01 Then I’ll be back in the studio next month
01:32:05 to introduce the last part of the program.
01:32:11 To conclude our January monthly program,
01:32:14 we’ll get to know brothers in the Central African Republic
01:32:18 during our video postcard.
01:32:21 As its name suggests, the Central African Republic
01:32:25 is near the exact center of the African continent.
01:32:30 Landlocked, it shares its border with six neighboring countries
01:32:34 and is comparable in size to France.
01:32:37 While it has two official languages —French and Sango—
01:32:41 there are also several other tribal languages spoken.
01:32:45 The Central African Republic is rich in natural resources,
01:32:50 such as diamonds, gold, and timber,
01:32:52 not to mention beautiful wildlife, such as antelope,
01:32:56 elephants,
01:32:58 baboons,
01:33:00 leopards, and many others that roam freely.
01:33:05 Sadly, this country has endured many years
01:33:09 of armed conflicts and civil unrest,
01:33:12 which has resulted in severe hardship for the people living there.
01:33:17 Despite these hardships, our brothers are working tirelessly
01:33:21 to provide spiritual relief.
01:33:23 For example, in the Bozoum Congregation,
01:33:26 there are some 70 publishers
01:33:28 and several pioneers.
01:33:30 Together, they’re conducting about 150 Bible studies!
01:33:34 Besides caring for their local territory,
01:33:38 the branch office has assigned the congregation
01:33:40 the care of three isolated groups.
01:33:43 These groups are up to 125 kilometers, or 78 miles,
01:33:48 away from Bozoum.
01:33:50 Reaching these groups is challenging for our brothers,
01:33:54 since there is no public transportation
01:33:56 and only 3 percent of the roads in the country
01:34:00 are paved.
01:34:02 Nevertheless, the Bozoum Congregation
01:34:04 regularly sends elders to give public talks
01:34:08 and conduct the Watchtower  Study in Bocaranga,
01:34:10 since there are no appointed brothers in that group of ten publishers.
01:34:14 Although there is civil unrest in Bocaranga,
01:34:18 the group is conducting some 30 Bible studies.
01:34:22 The Bocaranga brothers and sisters and the Bozoum Congregation
01:34:26 send their greetings to all of you
01:34:28 fellow Witnesses worldwide.
01:34:30 And we send our greetings back to all of our brothers
01:34:33 in the Central African Republic.
01:34:37 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:34:40 this is JW Broadcasting!

“How long would Jesus need to wait

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah would make him King?”

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:09.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, so “how do we know that Jesus

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:12.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not become King
when he was on earth

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or immediately after he was resurrected?”

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, because he didn’t.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus
teach his disciples to pray?

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, yep—well, I know the obvious.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your Kingdom come,”
implied future tense.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we know for sure
what’s going on in heaven?

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it would help
if we reviewed the cited scriptures here.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you leave, a suggestion:

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe if you were to study ahead of time?

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really . . .

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about no.

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really swamped.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re busy; we all are.

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have no clue, do you?

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to go.

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do next.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:21.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought she
was making our study a priority,

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:24.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe she wasn’t.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exams next week—it’s do or die time.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I remembered 1 Corinthians 3:6

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that ‘God keeps making it grow.’

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked him to help Jade
and then left it with him.

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I need to apologize.

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:50.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forget it, you were stressed.

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:52.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but there’s more.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside I knew you were right;

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just the last thing I wanted to hear.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, really.

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah?

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:18.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

. . . making a friend with God.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t know how to do that.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a friend?

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve done fine with me.

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can see you—but God, a Friend?

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seriously?

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about what you can see?

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does creation teach us about him?

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, not much

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe evolve or your species dies.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t really help.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not talking about evolution.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m talking about the things
that God has created.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t suppose he’s got
a little workshop up there building things

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one at a time, do you?

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the real world, things evolve.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:46.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all random.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what that
tells me about him.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t ready for this.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evolution isn’t my strong suit.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be good:

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many who believe evolution. . . 

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ancient tidal pool . . . 
chemicals spontaneously assembled . . .”

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s too deep.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!
Maybe: “What does the evidence reveal? . . .

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a cell to survive, . . . DNA . . .

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“RNA . . . inanimate chemicals. . .

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probability . . .”

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure this is what she needs.

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her real issue

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was getting to know
someone that she can’t see.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s the best place to begin.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One widespread false teaching . . .

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“robs people of hope . . . implies

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:59.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that human life has no purpose . . .”

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be it; establish the positive:

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What creation really says about Jehovah

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
versus what evolution obscures.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you got me thinking, . . .

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I did some research, . . .

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Yeah.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:18.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I think
you’ll really like what I found.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, come, sit down.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, let’s do this.

. . . just sum up the whole article.

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it.

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the answers in all that.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than just the answers.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m with it; I’m all about study.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you
remember more from our studies,

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answers or the things
that touch your heart?

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:46.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, like,
when we talked about immorality,

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew the answer,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:52.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you didn’t seem totally convinced

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in here.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find that answer.

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 6?

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But whoever practices sexual immorality

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure why,

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it made me think of Mum and Dad

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:28.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(his constant cheating, actually),

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mum’s humiliation,

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divorce, all the misery.

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want that.

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how right Jehovah is

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what Neeta
called meditation.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about clearing your mind
to find inner peace;

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:57.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s totally different.

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:03.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s asking how Jehovah
feels about something

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asking
what that means for me.

That was my best friend, Lucas,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:06.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were kids.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was me, Oscar.

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:12.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew exactly what we wanted to do

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:14.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we grew up:

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneer!

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to Bethel!

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build Kingdom Halls!

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We kept those goals.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when graduation came,

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were ready.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:35.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our little business needed
just a few more accounts.

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we’d have enough for us
and to help our families.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally!

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Day one of the service year

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and two new pioneers!

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we live, . . .

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please don’t call me ever again!

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . finding spiritual interest is tough.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already have cleaners.
Thanks.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding enough work
was harder than we thought.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few months in,
I was sure

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would help
if we just stuck it out.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Oscar.
Can’t make it today.

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something came up.
Lucas.

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What came up
was an opportunity for more money,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at what cost?

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you quitting, or what?

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m not quitting.

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering or our business?

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither, but you know the struggle here.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most brothers can afford
to pioneer for a year, two tops.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, it’s not full-time while I’m training.

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a backup plan.

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Lucas stopped pioneering?

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:48.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’s right.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s just being practical.

00:02:56.113 --> 00:03:00.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, is it wrong to quit
if you think it’s not working?

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I struggled with the same question
when I pioneered.

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:10.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you decide,

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you can tell Jehovah your reason

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:15.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a clean conscience,

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it’s the right decision for you.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I keep going
when it’s so difficult?

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since all these things
are to be dissolved in this way,

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“consider what sort of people
you ought to be

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in holy acts of conduct
and deeds of godly devotion.”

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really is “the last days,”

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:57.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people need “the good news.”

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll only hear it

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep up our “deeds of godly devotion”

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as best we can.

00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:13.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to endure and only stop pioneering

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if my circumstances left no other choice.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I prayed to see the blessings.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after a while,

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that a little perseverance,

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s spirit, can be contagious.

00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you want to do
when you grow up?

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneer.

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:50.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And go to Bethel?

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yep!

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:52.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then maybe build Kingdom Halls.

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:53.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You in?

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:54.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:09.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, when I was a teenager,

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:11.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t see any benefit

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:12.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in talking to my parents

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:15.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they
liked different things than I liked.

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Well, what’s the point?’

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I also wanted to be an adult.

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to feel like an adult
and be treated like an adult.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when my mom
used to pick me up from school.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to show personal interest in me,

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so she’d ask me:
“Oh, how are your friends doing?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How was school today?

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a lot of homework?”

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just thought that she was being nosy.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had my earphones on.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever my parents
were trying to talk to me,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was my chance
to just pop them in and ignore them.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:50.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The way my parents grew up wasn’t

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:52.281 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the same way that I grew up.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They grew up in a different country;

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spoke a different language;
they grew up in a different time.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re talking to somebody
who doesn’t speak your language natively,

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oftentimes you won’t be able
to explain things from your heart.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I had that challenge.

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t able to talk directly
to my parents heart to heart.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so there was always this frustration

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in trying to really convey how I felt.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like I
wasn’t really getting through to my parents.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:23.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to my first pioneer school,
I learned a lot about Jehovah’s qualities.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of them was
how he was a very approachable Person.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought to myself,
‘Am I an approachable person?’

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about how
I acted in the ministry

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then at the meetings and then at home.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that at home
I had a lot of things I needed to fix.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:43.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like it was two different worlds
I was living in.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was when I was at school with my peers;

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I was understood.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at home,
I kind of just withdrew to myself.

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t try to communicate with them
because it didn’t seem worth the effort.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to figure out problems in my own way.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was kind of trial and error.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I developed a lot of bad habits

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:09.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that today I’m still trying to overcome.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’d been able
to communicate with them more,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I’d been able to connect
with them and ask for their help

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get their support
and have them on my team,

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:20.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things would have gone a lot better.

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really wish I had.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, who was a perfect human being

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who had perfect judgment,
didn’t make decisions on his own.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always looked to his Father for guidance.

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that got me thinking,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, if Jesus did that,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:35.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘there has to be something good

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in it for me too.’

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:40.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What really helped me was Colossians 4:6.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I needed to speak
more graciously in the family.

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized
that I was speaking very defensively

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I needed
to be more approachable to my parents.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I first tried to talk with them,
of course,

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was awkward and I didn’t want to talk
about anything personal

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I wasn’t used to it.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I could maybe
ask them about themselves

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ask them how their day was
or what they liked from the meetings.

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:07.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just tried to show more interest in them

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of focusing on myself.

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:10.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that’s what got

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:11.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conversations going 

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got me comfortable

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really talk with them.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so focused on how my parents
weren’t understanding me

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:21.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I wasn’t really trying
to understand them.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I thought about my parents,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about how much work
it takes to be a parent.

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From when I was a baby, for many years,

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:33.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were working day and night
to try to care for me.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never demanded a thank you
or anything from me.

00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were really self-sacrificing.

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:44.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I imagined:
‘If I had to work that much for somebody,

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:48.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘how would I feel if they
didn’t really say thank you?

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or how would I feel

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if this person whom I worked so hard for

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t really view me as their friend?’

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later on, as I got older and started

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that communication going with my parents,

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:05.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that taking their advice
and really listening to their opinions

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and always letting them know

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:10.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I’m going to do
and where I’m going to go

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a mature thing to do.

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:14.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heart oftentimes

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes the driver’s seat, and it directs us

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where it thinks it should go.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And oftentimes it goes
in the wrong direction,

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we sometimes get hurt.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we look back and say,
“I wish I hadn’t done that.”

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our parents have been there.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they’re trying to do
for us now is to tell us,

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:36.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t let your heart
take the driver’s seat.”

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:39.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I could talk to my teenage self,

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:43.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would tell myself to see
my mom and dad more like coaches, 

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:46.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I used to think
they were always trying to criticize me

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:48.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and point out my faults.

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really, they’re just trying to help me,

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:54.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want me to have a happy life.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wish I knew that as a teenager.

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m glad I learned that now.

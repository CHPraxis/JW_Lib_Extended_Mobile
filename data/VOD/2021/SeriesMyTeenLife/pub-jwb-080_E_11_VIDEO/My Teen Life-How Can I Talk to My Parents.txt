00:00:08 Well, when I was a teenager,
00:00:09 I didn’t see any benefit
00:00:11 in talking to my parents
00:00:12 because they liked different things than I liked.
00:00:17 So I thought, ‘Well, what’s the point?’
00:00:19 And I also wanted to be an adult.
00:00:22 I wanted to feel like an adult and be treated like an adult.
00:00:25 I remember when my mom used to pick me up from school.
00:00:28 She wanted to show personal interest in me,
00:00:30 so she’d ask me: “Oh, how are your friends doing?
00:00:32 “How was school today?
00:00:34 Do you have a lot of homework?”
00:00:35 But I just thought that she was being nosy.
00:00:39 I always had my earphones on.
00:00:41 And whenever my parents were trying to talk to me,
00:00:44 that was my chance to just pop them in and ignore them.
00:00:49 The way my parents grew up wasn’t
00:00:50 the same way that I grew up.
00:00:52 They grew up in a different country;
00:00:53 they spoke a different language; they grew up in a different time.
00:00:58 When you’re talking to somebody who doesn’t speak your language natively,
00:01:02 oftentimes you won’t be able to explain things from your heart.
00:01:05 And so I had that challenge.
00:01:07 I wasn’t able to talk directly to my parents heart to heart.
00:01:10 And so there was always this frustration
00:01:13 in trying to really convey how I felt.
00:01:16 And I felt like I wasn’t really getting through to my parents.
00:01:19 When I went to my first pioneer school, I learned a lot about Jehovah’s qualities.
00:01:23 And one of them was how he was a very approachable Person.
00:01:27 And I thought to myself, ‘Am I an approachable person?’
00:01:32 And I thought about how I acted in the ministry
00:01:34 and then at the meetings and then at home.
00:01:37 And I realized that at home I had a lot of things I needed to fix.
00:01:41 I felt like it was two different worlds I was living in.
00:01:43 One was when I was at school with my peers;
00:01:46 I felt like I was understood.
00:01:48 And at home, I kind of just withdrew to myself.
00:01:52 I wouldn’t try to communicate with them because it didn’t seem worth the effort.
00:01:55 I tried to figure out problems in my own way.
00:01:58 It was kind of trial and error.
00:02:03 I developed a lot of bad habits
00:02:06 that today I’m still trying to overcome.
00:02:09 If I’d been able to communicate with them more,
00:02:12 if I’d been able to connect with them and ask for their help
00:02:15 and get their support and have them on my team,
00:02:18 things would have gone a lot better.
00:02:20 And I really wish I had.
00:02:23 Jesus, who was a perfect human being
00:02:25 and who had perfect judgment, didn’t make decisions on his own.
00:02:29 He always looked to his Father for guidance.
00:02:31 And that got me thinking,
00:02:33 ‘Well, if Jesus did that,
00:02:34 ‘there has to be something good
00:02:35 in it for me too.’
00:02:36 What really helped me was Colossians 4:6.
00:02:40 I knew I needed to speak more graciously in the family.
00:02:43 And I realized that I was speaking very defensively
00:02:47 and that I needed to be more approachable to my parents.
00:02:50 When I first tried to talk with them, of course,
00:02:52 it was awkward and I didn’t want to talk about anything personal
00:02:56 because I wasn’t used to it.
00:02:58 So I thought I could maybe ask them about themselves
00:03:01 —ask them how their day was or what they liked from the meetings.
00:03:05 So I just tried to show more interest in them
00:03:07 instead of focusing on myself.
00:03:09 And I think that’s what got
00:03:10 the conversations going
00:03:11 and got me comfortable
00:03:12 to really talk with them.
00:03:14 I was so focused on how my parents weren’t understanding me
00:03:18 that I wasn’t really trying to understand them.
00:03:23 When I thought about my parents,
00:03:25 I thought about how much work it takes to be a parent.
00:03:28 From when I was a baby, for many years,
00:03:31 they were working day and night to try to care for me.
00:03:33 They never demanded a thank you or anything from me.
00:03:37 They were really self-sacrificing.
00:03:40 And I imagined: ‘If I had to work that much for somebody,
00:03:44 ‘how would I feel if they didn’t really say thank you?
00:03:48 ‘Or how would I feel
00:03:50 ‘if this person whom I worked so hard for
00:03:52 didn’t really view me as their friend?’
00:03:55 Later on, as I got older and started
00:03:58 that communication going with my parents,
00:04:01 I realized that taking their advice and really listening to their opinions
00:04:05 and always letting them know
00:04:07 what I’m going to do and where I’m going to go
00:04:10 was a mature thing to do.
00:04:13 Our heart oftentimes
00:04:14 takes the driver’s seat, and it directs us
00:04:17 to where it thinks it should go.
00:04:19 And oftentimes it goes in the wrong direction,
00:04:22 and we sometimes get hurt.
00:04:25 Then we look back and say, “I wish I hadn’t done that.”
00:04:27 And our parents have been there.
00:04:29 What they’re trying to do for us now is to tell us,
00:04:34 “Don’t let your heart take the driver’s seat.”
00:04:36 If I could talk to my teenage self,
00:04:39 I would tell myself to see my mom and dad more like coaches,
00:04:43 because I used to think they were always trying to criticize me
00:04:46 and point out my faults.
00:04:48 But, really, they’re just trying to help me,
00:04:51 and they want me to have a happy life.
00:04:54 I really wish I knew that as a teenager.
00:04:56 But I’m glad I learned that now.

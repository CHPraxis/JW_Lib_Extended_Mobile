00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:09.530 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So I’m sitting in physics class,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and all of a sudden,

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:13.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the subject of evolution comes up.

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.703 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When my teacher asked me, “Why?”

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:17.162 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—to give the reason why I don’t believe

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.330 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in evolution—

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember all I could say was: “It’s just
because I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s my belief.”

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many students actually believe

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:30.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like, they seem so sure—
that evolution is a fact.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could feel my hands, like my palms,
getting sweaty

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was just nervous.

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt intimidated.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just sat there.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt paralyzed,
and I couldn’t defend the truth.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t I explain this?

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could explain so easily
why I don’t salute the flag

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why I don’t celebrate birthdays.

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:54.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t understand
why I couldn’t explain this specific topic.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had doubts.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was asking myself questions like:

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Does God really exist?

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the Bible accurate?’

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that day, after I came home from school,

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to my mom and I told her,

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what happened at school, and I need—
I need answers.”

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I didn’t know what to do,

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially since my parents
were not serving Jehovah.

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I had to pray to Jehovah to help me.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she sat me down at the computer.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:30.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to jw.org,

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in the search box,
my mom told me to type in anything

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was the problem
—what I had questions on.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we typed in “evolution.”

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:41.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I clicked
on <i>The Origin of Life </i> brochure.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just started, like, coming in.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.252 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everything started clicking as if, like,

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:49.588 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you know, there’s a light bulb that went off.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:54.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in one of the videos in the “Viewpoints
on the Origin of Life” section,

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it talked about the brain

00:01:57.012 --> 00:01:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how the brain is so complex

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that billions and billions

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of neurons are connected to one another.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:09.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It amazed me so much
that because of the brain,

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can move our hands,
we can move our feet,

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can do facial expressions.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.572 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We can do so many things

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because of this great part of the body

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:18.617 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the brain.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:20.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had, you know, the exact questions

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was having trouble understanding.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for each question, I was like,

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:30.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, I remember reading this
in one of the <i>Watchtowers</i>

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or one of the books I was studying.’

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:34.383 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But it broke it down into ways

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:36.969 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and into words that were simple for me

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.178 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to understand at that point.

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was almost—
It felt like

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was talking to me

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
through this brochure.

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:45.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And it just felt—

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was like, ‘This is what I need to read.’

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what helped me get through it.

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought to myself:
‘This couldn’t have been

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:55.821 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘made just by chance.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.407 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘It couldn’t just exist by an accident.

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:00.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It had to be created.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to be designed.’

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was able to go back.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to my science class,
and I told my teacher,

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m ready to explain why.”

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here we go again.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s physics class.

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:16.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the same topic all over again.

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:18.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time it was different.

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to defend my faith in Jehovah.

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:25.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that, you know,
Jehovah always provides the answers

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to any topic—anything.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just have to be willing to go and find it.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever I have questions about anything,
I look for the answers.

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, I pray to Jehovah.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has made it so easy for us
to find the truth.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m totally convinced
that whatever he says in the Bible,

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can completely trust in it.

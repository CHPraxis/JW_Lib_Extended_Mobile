It’s still chaos in many parts of the city,

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with armed soldiers detaining and arresting

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 those not pledging support

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the new government.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we still going to the meeting tonight?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to do what was best

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for my wife and daughter.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a few of the elders

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have already been arrested.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if I was arrested?

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would happen to my family?

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not going home to pray, are you?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray at my window three times a day,

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day.

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I even appear to compromise,

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they think?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I trust him,

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:43.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that I keep my faith

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we all keep our faith—

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how this ends.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are clear.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must continue to meet together,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in small groups if necessary.

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:01.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just pray that whatever happens,

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:04.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the strength to endure it.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear Jehovah God, please . . .

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I was arrested.

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:26.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We miss you so much,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re very proud of you.

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know whatever the outcome of your trial,

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll maintain your faith,

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will we.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you scared?

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very scared,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah helps us when we’re scared.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I would be OK

00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would take care of my family.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all went by so quickly

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pioneering,

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreign language,

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circuit work.

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:27.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was even a time

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was the one encouraging older ones.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:34.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss those days so much.

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now I’m the one in a nursing home.

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I feel like I have

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:48.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing left to offer.

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:56.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Daniel,

00:03:57.883 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you very precious man.

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:05.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been sent to you.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words have been heard

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:12.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the first day you gave your heart

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:13.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understanding.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no strength.

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no breath left in me.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, O very precious man.

00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you have peace.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong.

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong!

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:37.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on to the end.

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:40.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will rest, but you will stand up

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, just checking on you.

00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a minute?

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something I’ve been wanting

00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share with you.

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:55.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sure.

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah does remember me,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I still have much to offer.

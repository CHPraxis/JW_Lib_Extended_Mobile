00:00:07 Few things in life are more painful
00:00:10 than the death of someone we love.
00:00:13 When my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s,
00:00:15 I felt incredibly worried and anxious.
00:00:19 When he finally passed away,
00:00:22 I had spent so much time worrying about him
00:00:25 and thinking about him
00:00:27 that I felt a huge emptiness.
00:00:29 I didn’t really know what to do with myself.
00:00:32 Shiho, our daughter,
00:00:36 died from a sickness
00:00:38 when she was 16 years old.
00:00:40 She had a disability,
00:00:43 so she was always with us.
00:00:45 Losing someone who was always there,
00:00:49 you know, right here in front of you
00:00:51 —that loss can’t be expressed in words.
00:00:57 If you’ve experienced the loss of someone you love,
00:01:00 is there anything that can help ease the pain?
00:01:05 No two people experience grief in the same way.
00:01:08 But there are some practical suggestions
00:01:10 that may help you.
00:01:12 These are frequently cited by grief counselors as being effective.
00:01:17 Number one: Accept support from your friends and family.
00:01:22 I found it difficult to accept help from others
00:01:25 because I felt like what I was going through
00:01:27 was so difficult that I felt like my friends wouldn’t understand.
00:01:31 But when I reached out to my friends,
00:01:35 they could do some of the things
00:01:37 that I maybe had enjoyed with my dad.
00:01:39 And so it gave me the confidence
00:01:42 that I wasn’t going to be alone
00:01:44 —that I had friends that could fill that hole for me.
00:01:48 Our friends sent us upbuilding messages
00:01:52 and lots of flowers,
00:01:55 enough to fill up this room.
00:01:57 Friends are a big help.
00:02:00 They truly were there for us.
00:02:08 Number two: Take care of your health.
00:02:12 Maintain a balanced diet,
00:02:15 stay physically active,
00:02:17 drink plenty of water,
00:02:20 and try to get enough sleep.
00:02:23 This is especially important when you are grieving,
00:02:26 because grief can be exhausting.
00:02:29 I found that if I didn’t get good enough sleep,
00:02:32 it made things a lot harder.
00:02:35 I try to avoid being on my phone
00:02:37 too much before bed, and I try and do things that relax me.
00:02:42 Number three: Be balanced.
00:02:47 Many find it helpful to alternate
00:02:49 periods of grieving with breaks in their routine.
00:02:53 You might consider spending time with new friends,
00:02:56 learning new skills, or just enjoying some time off.
00:03:03 While at home, I was a bit down and maybe a little pessimistic.
00:03:08 But when I stepped outside, I noticed how nice
00:03:12 the breeze was and I felt so much better.
00:03:15 Taking moments to relax works.
00:03:23 Number four: Help others.
00:03:28 Many find it helpful to use some of their time
00:03:30 to help others, including friends and relatives
00:03:34 who are also grieving the loss of your loved one.
00:03:38 Acts 20:35, where it says
00:03:41 “there is more happiness in giving than there is
00:03:43 in receiving,” really helped me.
00:03:45 So I tried every day, even if it was reaching out
00:03:50 on the phone, to do something for someone else.
00:03:53 And I found that really helped
00:03:55 with not just making me happy but it helped control my anxiety too.
00:04:01 Number five: Remember your loved one.
00:04:05 Many find it comforting to do things
00:04:08 that help keep alive the memory of the person they’ve lost.
00:04:12 We sometimes talk about her,
00:04:14 saying, “Shiho used to laugh if we said this”
00:04:18 or “Do you remember she liked this?”,
00:04:20 and remembering those moments
00:04:22 warms our hearts.
00:04:24 None of these things can
00:04:26 completely erase the pain of grief,
00:04:29 but they may provide you with at least a measure of relief.
00:04:34 The advice offered in this video is in perfect harmony
00:04:37 with principles found in the Bible.
00:04:41 Many who have lost someone they love have found
00:04:43 that turning to the Bible gives them peace of mind and comfort.

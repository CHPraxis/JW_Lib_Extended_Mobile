Few things in life are more painful

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the death of someone we love.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.619 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I felt incredibly worried and anxious.

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he finally passed away,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had spent so much time worrying about him

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:27.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thinking about him

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:29.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I felt a huge emptiness.

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:31.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t really know what to do with myself.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:36.307 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Shiho, our daughter,

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:38.142 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
died from a sickness

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she was 16 years old.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had a disability,

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so she was always with us.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Losing someone who was always there,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, right here in front of you

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that loss can’t be expressed in words.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve experienced the loss
of someone you love,

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there anything
that can help ease the pain?

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:08.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No two people experience
grief in the same way.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are some practical suggestions

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may help you.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are frequently cited
by grief counselors as being effective.

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
Accept support from your friends and family.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found it difficult
to accept help from others

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I felt like what I was going through

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was so difficult that I felt like
my friends wouldn’t understand.

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I reached out to my friends,

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:37.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could do some of the things

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I maybe had enjoyed with my dad.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it gave me the confidence

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I wasn’t going to be alone

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I had friends
that could fill that hole for me.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:52.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our friends sent us upbuilding messages

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lots of flowers,

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enough to fill up this room.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends are a big help.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They truly were there for us.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two:
Take care of your health.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maintain a balanced diet,

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay physically active,

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drink plenty of water,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try to get enough sleep.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:26.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is especially important
when you are grieving,

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because grief can be exhausting.

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found that if I
didn’t get good enough sleep,

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made things a lot harder.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to avoid being on my phone

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
too much before bed,
and I try and do things that relax me.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three:
Be balanced.

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many find it helpful to alternate

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
periods of grieving
with breaks in their routine.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might consider spending time
with new friends,

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:01.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning new skills,
or just enjoying some time off.

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:08.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While at home, I was a bit down
and maybe a little pessimistic.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I stepped outside,
I noticed how nice

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the breeze was and I felt so much better.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taking moments to relax works.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number four: Help others.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many find it helpful
to use some of their time

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others,
including friends and relatives

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:38.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are also grieving
the loss of your loved one.

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:41.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 20:35, where it says

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there is more happiness
in giving than there is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in receiving,” really helped me.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I tried every day,
even if it was reaching out

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the phone,
to do something for someone else.

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:55.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I found that really helped

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:59.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with not just making me happy
but it helped control my anxiety too.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number five:
Remember your loved one.

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:08.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many find it comforting to do things

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:12.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help keep alive the memory
of the person they’ve lost.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sometimes talk about her,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying, “Shiho used to laugh if we said this”

00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:20.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “Do you remember she liked this?”,

00:04:20.197 --> 00:04:22.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remembering those moments

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
warms our hearts.

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of these things can 

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:29.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely erase the pain of grief,

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they may provide you
with at least a measure of relief.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The advice offered in this video
is in perfect harmony 

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with principles found in the Bible.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many who have lost someone
they love have found

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that turning to the Bible gives them
peace of mind and comfort.

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

At 6:00 a.m.,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband and I were woken up

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a loud bang on the door.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.385 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As soon as my husband had opened the door,

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.470 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
people burst in shouting,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone on the floor!”

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heard them

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very aggressively
ordering him to do something.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I heard some noise, and I realized

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was being beaten.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Feliks, and I

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were on our way back from the shopping mall

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:31.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the car park.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A jeep with tinted windows

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blocked our path, and people

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with weapons
jumped out, shouting:

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the ground!
Don’t move!”

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks was sent
to a pretrial detention facility,

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he spent a year.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first bang on the door,

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:56.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began praying to Jehovah
for wisdom, calmness,

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for holy spirit
so that I could make the right decisions

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act in the right way.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for the whole day, I was praying.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered all my prayers,

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt that he was close at my side.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:14.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before each court hearing
when I was very afraid

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and felt overwhelmed by emotion
and couldn’t calm myself down,

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was prayer

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped me to settle down.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they took us for interrogation,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started panicking and, at that moment,

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to meditate on something positive.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought,

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I need to sing our songs.’

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:39.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just one song came into my mind:

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Will Make You Strong.”

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really strengthened me.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words
about how Jehovah gave his Son for us

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show he loves us and will never leave us.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray and tell me

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are praying for me.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives me the feeling that I am part

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a large family.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the interrogation,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was sent home.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to stick to our spiritual routine.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continue to conduct family worship,
and we are always in the ministry.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
constantly support us.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They write kind words;

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they commend us;

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they send us
encouraging scriptures from the Bible.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:36.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to three years
in a general regime colony.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he and the other brothers arrived there,
they were beaten up by officers

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the colony.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks told me

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he prayed
while he was being beaten,

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he noticed that at that moment,
he stopped feeling the pain.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While he is behind bars,

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks tries to conduct
family worship with me by letters.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He picks certain themes
and some specific questions.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I do research

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the publications
and send back what I find.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30
really strengthens me,

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:27.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says
that “your strength will be in keeping calm

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing trust.”

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I tend to worry,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that calmness is expressed

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fully trusting in Jehovah.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have become stronger
because thanks to Jehovah,

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way, I have developed almost a shell

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the difficulties

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that used to scare me.

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:51.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That confidence and faith help me.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with me,

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will remain

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close by me,

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be made stronger thanks to him,

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:02.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will get through these trials.

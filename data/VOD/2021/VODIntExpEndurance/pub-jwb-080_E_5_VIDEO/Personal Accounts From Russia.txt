00:00:02 At 6:00 a.m.,
00:00:04 my husband and I were woken up
00:00:05 by a loud bang on the door.
00:00:08 As soon as my husband had opened the door,
00:00:10 people burst in shouting,
00:00:12 “Everyone on the floor!”
00:00:14 I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen
00:00:17 and heard them
00:00:18 very aggressively ordering him to do something.
00:00:20 Then I heard some noise, and I realized
00:00:22 that he was being beaten.
00:00:25 My husband, Feliks, and I
00:00:27 were on our way back from the shopping mall
00:00:30 to the car park.
00:00:31 A jeep with tinted windows
00:00:33 blocked our path, and people
00:00:35 with weapons jumped out, shouting:
00:00:37 “On the ground! Don’t move!”
00:00:40 We were thrown against the vehicle.
00:00:42 Feliks was sent to a pretrial detention facility,
00:00:45 where he spent a year.
00:00:49 From the very first bang on the door,
00:00:52 I began praying to Jehovah for wisdom, calmness,
00:00:56 and for holy spirit so that I could make the right decisions
00:00:59 and act in the right way.
00:01:00 And for the whole day, I was praying.
00:01:02 Jehovah answered all my prayers,
00:01:04 and I felt that he was close at my side.
00:01:11 Before each court hearing when I was very afraid
00:01:14 and felt overwhelmed by emotion and couldn’t calm myself down,
00:01:17 it was prayer
00:01:19 that helped me to settle down.
00:01:23 When they took us for interrogation,
00:01:26 I started panicking and, at that moment,
00:01:29 I realized that I needed to meditate on something positive.
00:01:32 So I thought,
00:01:34 ‘I need to sing our songs.’
00:01:36 And just one song came into my mind:
00:01:39 “He Will Make You Strong.”
00:01:41 It really strengthened me.
00:01:44 Those words about how Jehovah gave his Son for us
00:01:47 show he loves us and will never leave us.
00:01:52 Brothers and sisters
00:01:54 pray and tell me
00:01:56 that they are praying for me.
00:01:58 It gives me the feeling that I am part
00:02:00 of a large family.
00:02:04 After the interrogation,
00:02:07 he was sent home.
00:02:08 My husband and I
00:02:10 continue to stick to our spiritual routine.
00:02:14 We continue to conduct family worship, and we are always in the ministry.
00:02:19 Our brothers and sisters constantly support us.
00:02:22 They write kind words;
00:02:24 they commend us;
00:02:27 they send us encouraging scriptures from the Bible.
00:02:31 In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty
00:02:36 and sentenced to three years in a general regime colony.
00:02:42 When he and the other brothers arrived there, they were beaten up by officers
00:02:46 from the colony.
00:02:49 Feliks told me
00:02:50 that he prayed while he was being beaten,
00:02:54 and he noticed that at that moment, he stopped feeling the pain.
00:03:01 While he is behind bars,
00:03:03 Feliks tries to conduct family worship with me by letters.
00:03:08 He picks certain themes and some specific questions.
00:03:12 Then I do research
00:03:14 in the publications and send back what I find.
00:03:19 The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30 really strengthens me,
00:03:22 where it says that “your strength will be in keeping calm
00:03:28 and showing trust.”
00:03:29 Although I tend to worry,
00:03:32 I understand that calmness is expressed
00:03:35 by fully trusting in Jehovah.
00:03:39 I have become stronger because thanks to Jehovah,
00:03:42 in a way, I have developed almost a shell
00:03:46 against the difficulties
00:03:48 that used to scare me.
00:03:49 That confidence and faith help me.
00:03:51 Jehovah was with me,
00:03:53 and he will remain
00:03:55 close by me,
00:03:56 and we will be made stronger thanks to him,
00:03:58 and we will get through these trials.

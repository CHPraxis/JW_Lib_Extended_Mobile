When I was in my 40’s, I was divorced,

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:08.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had three younger kids at home,

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working three jobs,

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had drifted away from the congregation.

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had an acquaintance who was telling me

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was in a cult

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I needed to look

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at some information that he had.

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was about 30 years old,

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.676 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a fellow employee saw

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:32.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and was trying to access jw.org.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told me about someone
he knew in another country

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could prove to me
that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t have the truth.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me curious,

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and little by little, I was persuaded to look

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at apostate material.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born and raised in the truth,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the age of 16,

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:57.870 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but I began to associate with people

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.039 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who had either formerly been associated

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.123 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the truth

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or were very loosely associated
with Jehovah and his organization,

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s really where the apostasy
began to take root.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was reading this literature,

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw through it to an extent,

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you’re drifting away,

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re looking for a reason not to believe.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:24.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to feed my mind

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with different philosophies, different ideas.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even studied different religions.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, I told myself
that I was doing that academically,

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it started to influence the way

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I thought and felt about things.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:43.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the elders reached out to me.

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very combative with those brothers.

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:50.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even made the accusation
that Noah’s ark was

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fairy tale,
that it was part of mythology.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those apostate doubts that I was reading

00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped reading the publications,

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped going to the meetings,

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result,
my spiritual routine was dead.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:10.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I’d try to find truth elsewhere.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I looked for something out there that was

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with what I knew the Bible taught.

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I couldn’t find anything.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Sunday morning,
I rode by the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said to myself,

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, they’re all in there
waiting for Armageddon.’

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately when I thought that thought,

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to myself:

00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, at least they
feel good about themselves.

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel?’

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer was I felt terrible.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, by skillful use of the Scriptures
and just reasoning with me,

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:45.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders got me to realize

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had been ‘carried off’

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that I had been ‘taken captive’
by human philosophy,

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:53.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the deceptions

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the empty reasoning of men.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually said a prayer;
I supplicated Jehovah

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would really show me
the way to the truth.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took away

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this feeling of emptiness,
spiritually speaking.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that a relationship with Jehovah

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:15.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s our most precious possession.

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to get back.

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:20.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible with sincerity.

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart,

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted it to effect
change in my behavior.

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now as I did that,
I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts.

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to help me
to rebuild that relationship with him.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I began to use Jehovah’s name.

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a great pleasure to me.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result was that my ministry
was very productive.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:47.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s an amazing joy

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to help someone
come to love Jehovah.

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just so happy

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be back under Jehovah’s wings

00:03:56.298 --> 00:03:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have that peace of mind.

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How loving Jehovah is!

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to help us.

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:03.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what better helper could we have?

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the best in the universe.

When I went through difficult times
during my childhood,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was like my Father.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was my refuge.

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first memory I have of my dad

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when I went to visit him

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:27.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the prison where he was being held.

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jehovah so many times
for my dad to come back home.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day,

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mom said, “Dad’s coming home today.”

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:45.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to school,
and when I came back, he was there.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that he was finally back for good
and that it would be forever.

00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But soon after that,
I heard my mom and my grandmother crying,

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they started to explain
that my dad was back in prison.

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From then on, I felt hatred,
resentment, and anger toward my dad

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also toward Jehovah.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to take drugs

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to lead an immoral and violent lifestyle.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a couple of sisters
gave me a magazine.

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was looking through it,

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the experience about Dustin.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to think about the times

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during my childhood

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I would take refuge in Jehovah

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would feel the same way Dustin did.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say: “Jehovah is there.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hasn’t abandoned me.”

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin never doubted Jehovah’s love,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up until the day he died.

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him to forgive me because,

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:10.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well,

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wasn’t his fault.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night I poured out all my feelings
to Jehovah.

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt Jehovah’s love every step of the way.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed it through the brothers
who didn’t judge me for what I had done.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how many problems we have

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how far we’ve drifted away from Jehovah.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never abandons us.

00:00:03 As a child, I dreamed
00:00:06 of becoming a ballerina.
00:00:09 I trained as a ballet dancer from childhood.
00:00:12 I was taught to give complete obedience to the artistic director,
00:00:16 absolute loyalty to the dance company,
00:00:19 and to put ballet before everything else in my life.
00:00:25 I finally realized there’s no way to get ahead in this world
00:00:28 without compromise.
00:00:31 It just can’t be done.
00:00:33 Such a life is empty and unsatisfying.
00:00:41 The problem is, once you get into that,
00:00:44 you get lulled in by that glamour and glitz.
00:00:48 Now, down the road when you finally see the trap
00:00:52 and what you got into, it’s very hard to get out.
00:00:55 And I always tell young people, you know,
00:00:58 that it doesn’t matter how good everything seems; it doesn’t matter how great.
00:01:02 There’s always a string attached—always.
00:01:06 And then one day, you’re going to wake up and it’s a rope.
00:01:10 And you can’t cut a rope that easily
00:01:13 —meaning you can’t get out of the situation
00:01:15 once Satan has you trapped in it.
00:01:18 And it happens without you even realizing it.
00:01:22 Ballet is discipline,
00:01:24 and I had to figure out a way
00:01:27 to take that skill
00:01:29 and transfer it into my everyday life.
00:01:31 It took some time, but I finally figured it out,
00:01:33 because it’s not a waste.
00:01:35 It’s good.
00:01:36 But what I had to learn was to get out of my comfort zone.
00:01:41 We were in Bethel until 1987.
00:01:44 Jack had a job lined up when we left Bethel, and that was good.
00:01:49 I couldn’t get a job because of my physical health issues.
00:01:53 I probably was in bed for about five months.
00:01:56 Eventually, I started feeling better,
00:01:59 and that’s when I realized how bad the medical bills were getting.
00:02:03 I just dragged myself out of bed and went and looked for a part-time job.
00:02:08 Obviously, through all of this, Jack and I just kept praying.
00:02:11 We knew Jehovah would take care of us.
00:02:13 No question about that.
00:02:15 Eventually, I did get a job at a law firm.
00:02:18 It was a good job.
00:02:20 I actually lasted there 30 years.
00:02:22 Absolutely Jehovah blessed me,
00:02:25 and I believe what he was blessing were my efforts.
00:02:28 I didn’t quit, and I refused to compromise.
00:02:32 When I started seeing that I was really learning this new skill
00:02:36 and I was getting good at it,
00:02:38 that’s when I sat down and I said: “Well, Jehovah, I have this new skill.
00:02:41 I want to be able to use it for you.”
00:02:43 One thing led to another, and I became
00:02:46 a commuter Bethelite for the Legal Department.
00:02:48 I’d say that about 11 years after I had left Bethel,
00:02:52 I was working and all of a sudden, I got sick again with the same thing
00:02:56 —complete rapid loss of weight and all the weakness came back.
00:02:59 I was eventually diagnosed as having celiac disease.
00:03:03 So once I changed my diet, I just started getting better and better.
00:03:08 I stayed with the law firm until 2014,
00:03:10 and then my husband and I retired and moved to another part of the country.
00:03:14 And now, currently, I’m a remote Bethel consultant.
00:03:19 If you slave for the world, you really are a slave.
00:03:22 If you slave for Jehovah,
00:03:24 in my opinion, you’re not slaving at all.
00:03:27 You couldn’t have a better partnership
00:03:29 than you and Jehovah, and that’s how I view it.
00:03:34 And you’re never going to experience Jehovah to the full
00:03:37 unless you put yourself out there for him to use.
00:03:40 I’ve had a wonderful life
00:03:43 of extraordinary spiritual privileges.
00:03:46 There’s no career in the world that is ever going to come close to that.

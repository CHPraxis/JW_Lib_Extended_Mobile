00:00:20 Music expresses things
00:00:23 that you can’t express in any other way.
00:00:29 It is so powerful.
00:00:38 It’s just an amazing gift.
00:00:42 Before I got the truth, I lived for music.
00:00:46 I played hard and heavy rock and roll
00:00:48 in bars and clubs around the New York City area for many years.
00:00:53 To me, I just found it to be a very depressing atmosphere.
00:00:58 But then I developed a love for classical music,
00:01:00 and I would practice six hours a day.
00:01:04 I applied to The Juilliard School for the performing arts.
00:01:06 I was accepted,
00:01:07 but I did not attend.
00:01:10 Deep inside something was missing.
00:01:15 My life changed drastically on February 16, 1973,
00:01:20 because that’s when I learned the truth in a taxicab.
00:01:31 I came to Bethel on February 16, 1979.
00:01:37 When I first came to Bethel,
00:01:39 I had to put music aside for a little bit.
00:01:41 I started working in the pressroom,
00:01:43 and that was a completely different environment for me.
00:01:46 I also worked with landscaping.
00:01:48 I worked in construction over at Wallkill,
00:01:50 and I also worked with drafting and engineering.
00:01:53 These were things I was not good at,
00:01:55 but I really felt I learned so much
00:01:58 from doing these things that it really kind of groomed me.
00:02:01 And I think that when Jehovah looked at me,
00:02:03 he said, ‘Well, we got somebody we have to work with here.’
00:02:09 Just as you tune your instrument so it can be played in tune,
00:02:12 Jehovah tunes you.
00:02:14 He teaches us to keep things in their place
00:02:17 and put worship of him first because that’s where it’s proper.
00:02:19 When Jehovah became number one, everything else took its place.
00:02:24 Back in 1981, I met my wife when I was playing music at a wedding.
00:02:28 We fell in love with each other.
00:02:33 As our love for Jehovah grows through the years,
00:02:35 our love for our mates grows.
00:02:37 Now, I didn’t leave music completely, because I still had a love for it;
00:02:41 I still practiced as much as I could within my Bethel schedule
00:02:45 and within my whole theocratic schedule.
00:02:48 I don’t miss it being number one.
00:02:50 I just feel happier now that it’s in its proper place.
00:02:53 In 1995, when I first came over to Patterson,
00:02:56 I was working with Audio/Video Services.
00:02:59 Since 2016,
00:03:01 I’ve been working with music —working as a music editor
00:03:03 and as a music composer.
00:03:06 Working with brothers on a piece of music
00:03:08 is a real blessing and a privilege.
00:03:10 Jehovah is letting us take advantage of a tool that we all like to listen to
00:03:13 but now using it in a way that praises him.
00:03:18 Our whole motive is not to earn money.
00:03:21 Our whole motive in using music
00:03:23 is to glorify our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:03:25 And we get music from all different cultures.
00:03:29 It really unites Jehovah’s people.
00:03:33 Music—it has a very special power in being able to reach the heart.
00:03:37 Now, there are times when we just sit around
00:03:39 and just jam and play,
00:03:41 and you’re really talking and communicating with each other.
00:03:44 There’s nothing like it.
00:03:46 I’m happier now
00:03:49 knowing that I’ve lived a clean life.
00:03:59 Do I have any regrets?
00:04:01 I have no regrets.
00:04:04 What I did when I was 22 years old
00:04:08 was the best thing that ever happened to me
00:04:10 because that’s how I came to know Jehovah
00:04:12 and that’s how I was able to find a balance in my life.
00:04:15 Our happiness doesn’t depend on our job.
00:04:19 Our happiness really depends upon our spirituality
00:04:22 and our relationship with Jehovah.
00:04:31 That’s what life is all about.
00:04:38 It’s a wonderful life.

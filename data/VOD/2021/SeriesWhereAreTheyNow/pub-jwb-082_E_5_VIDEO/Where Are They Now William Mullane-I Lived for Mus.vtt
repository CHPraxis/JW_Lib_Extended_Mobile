Music expresses things

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can’t express in any other way.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is so powerful.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just an amazing gift.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:46.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I got the truth, I lived for music.

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I played hard and heavy rock and roll

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:53.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in bars and clubs
around the New York City area for many years.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, I just found it to be
a very depressing atmosphere.

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I developed
a love for classical music,

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would practice six hours a day.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I applied to The Juilliard School
for the performing arts.

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:07.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was accepted,

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I did not attend.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deep inside something was missing.

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life changed drastically
on February 16, 1973,

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s
when I learned the truth in a taxicab.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to Bethel on February 16, 1979.

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I first came to Bethel,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to put music aside for a little bit.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started working in the pressroom,

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was
a completely different environment for me.

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also worked with landscaping.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked in construction over at Wallkill,

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:53.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also worked
with drafting and engineering.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were things I was not good at,

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I really felt I learned so much

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from doing these things
that it really kind of groomed me.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that when Jehovah looked at me,

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, ‘Well, we got somebody
we have to work with here.’

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:12.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as you tune your instrument
so it can be played in tune,

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:14.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tunes you.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He teaches us to keep things in their place

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put worship of him first
because that’s where it’s proper.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah became number one,
everything else took its place.

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:28.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in 1981, I met my wife
when I was playing music at a wedding.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We fell in love with each other.

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our love for Jehovah
grows through the years,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our love for our mates grows.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I didn’t leave music completely,
because I still had a love for it;

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still practiced as much as I could
within my Bethel schedule

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and within my whole theocratic schedule.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t miss it being number one.

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just feel happier now
that it’s in its proper place.

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1995, when I first came over to Patterson,

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working with Audio/Video Services.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:01.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 2016,

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been working with music
—working as a music editor

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:05.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a music composer.

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:08.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working with brothers on a piece of music

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a real blessing and a privilege.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is letting us take advantage
of a tool that we all like to listen to

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:16.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now using it in a way that praises him.

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:21.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our whole motive is not to earn money.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our whole motive in using music

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to glorify our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we get music from all different cultures.

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:31.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really unites Jehovah’s people.

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:37.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Music—it has a very special power
in being able to reach the heart.

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:39.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are times
when we just sit around

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:41.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just jam and play,

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re really talking
and communicating with each other.

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:46.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing like it.

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m happier now

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that I’ve lived a clean life.

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I have any regrets?

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no regrets.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:08.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I did when I was 22 years old

00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:10.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best thing that ever happened to me

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s how I came to know Jehovah

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:14.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s how I was able
to find a balance in my life.

00:04:15.984 --> 00:04:19.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our happiness doesn’t depend on our job.

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our happiness really depends
upon our spirituality

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what life is all about.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:40.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful life.

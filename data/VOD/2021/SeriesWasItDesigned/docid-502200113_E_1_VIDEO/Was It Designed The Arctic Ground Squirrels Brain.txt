00:00:07 Arctic ground squirrels
00:00:09 hibernate up to seven months every year.
00:00:16 Though sometimes
00:00:18 compared to sleep, hibernation
00:00:20 is very different.
00:00:23 Sleep refreshes the brain.
00:00:25 In contrast, hibernation seems to devastate it.
00:00:31 As the squirrel enters hibernation,
00:00:34 his breathing and heartbeat slow dramatically
00:00:38 and his tiny body chills to just below freezing.
00:00:43 Blood flow slows to a trickle
00:00:45 and deprives his brain of oxygen and nutrition.
00:00:49 As the days pass,
00:00:51 brain cells called neurons
00:00:53 shrink and thousands or even millions of connections
00:00:57 that make up his memories appear to dissolve.
00:01:02 Proteins clump and cling to the neurons,
00:01:05 advancing memory loss.
00:01:08 In some ways, his brain starts to resemble
00:01:11 a brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease.
00:01:14 Then something amazing happens.
00:01:19 About every two weeks,
00:01:21 he shivers vigorously until his body warms
00:01:24 to its normal temperature,
00:01:26 which it remains at for up to 15 hours.
00:01:30 During this time, his brain cleans away the clumped proteins
00:01:35 and regrows the shrunken neurons,
00:01:38 restoring full brain capacity in about two hours.
00:01:42 The process is repeated
00:01:44 during his entire seven-month hibernation
00:01:47 —depriving his brain of food and oxygen
00:01:50 and then rebuilding it about every two weeks
00:01:56 until he emerges in the spring
00:02:01 unscathed.
00:02:04 And that’s not all.
00:02:06 Scientists think that old connections between neurons
00:02:10 are somehow marked for quick reconnection.
00:02:13 So the squirrel gets back not just a working brain
00:02:16 but also something inconceivable
00:02:19 —his memories.
00:02:22 Researchers hope a better understanding
00:02:25 of this process will pave the way for therapies
00:02:28 to treat disease in the human brain.
00:02:31 What do you think?
00:02:33 Did the regenerative ability
00:02:35 of the arctic ground squirrel’s brain simply evolve?
00:02:38 Or was it designed?

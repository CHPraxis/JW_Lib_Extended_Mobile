Arctic ground squirrels

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hibernate up to seven months every year.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though sometimes

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to sleep, hibernation 

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very different.

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sleep refreshes the brain.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, hibernation
seems to devastate it.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the squirrel enters hibernation,

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his breathing and heartbeat slow dramatically

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his tiny body chills
to just below freezing.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blood flow slows to a trickle

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deprives his brain
of oxygen and nutrition.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the days pass,

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brain cells called neurons

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shrink and thousands
or even millions of connections

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make up his memories appear to dissolve.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proteins clump and cling to the neurons,

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
advancing memory loss.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some ways, his brain starts to resemble

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then something amazing happens.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About every two weeks,

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he shivers vigorously until his body warms

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to its normal temperature,

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which it remains at for up to 15 hours.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:35.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this time,
his brain cleans away the clumped proteins

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:38.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and regrows the shrunken neurons,

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
restoring full brain capacity
in about two hours.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The process is repeated

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during his entire seven-month hibernation

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—depriving his brain of food and oxygen

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then rebuilding it about every two weeks

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until he emerges in the spring

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unscathed.

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:06.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s not all.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scientists think
that old connections between neurons

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are somehow marked for quick reconnection.

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the squirrel gets back
not just a working brain

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also something inconceivable

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his memories.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Researchers hope a better understanding

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this process
will pave the way for therapies

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to treat disease in the human brain.

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:33.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the regenerative ability

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the arctic ground squirrel’s brain
simply evolve?

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

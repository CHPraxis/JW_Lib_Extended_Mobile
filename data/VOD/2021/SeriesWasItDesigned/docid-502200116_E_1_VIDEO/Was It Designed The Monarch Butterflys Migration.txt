00:00:08 Every spring
00:00:10 the eastern monarch butterfly begins a migration
00:00:13 that rivals that of some birds and whales.
00:00:19 How does such a delicate insect make such a long trip?
00:00:26 Monarchs are strong, efficient flyers
00:00:29 thanks to their wing shape and the way they flap them.
00:00:34 They may also glide on air currents for an extra boost.
00:00:43 In spring, millions of monarch butterflies
00:00:46 leave central Mexico.
00:00:50 They fly northeast
00:00:52 for several hundred miles,
00:00:53 where they reach
00:00:54 the end of their lifespan.
00:00:59 Amazingly, the end of their life
00:01:01 doesn’t mean the end of the journey.
00:01:04 Before they die, they lay eggs.
00:01:13 The next generation hatches, matures,
00:01:17 and keeps flying north again and again
00:01:21 until up to four generations later
00:01:24 when the great
00:01:25 and great-great grandchildren
00:01:27 of the original monarchs
00:01:29 occupy their summer home
00:01:31 mostly throughout
00:01:32 the northeastern United States.
00:01:34 They perform this multigenerational relay
00:01:37 with no training, no map,
00:01:39 and a brain no larger than the head of a pin.
00:01:43 Amazingly, one thing they do have is
00:01:47 a solar compass.
00:01:50 It tells them what direction to fly
00:01:53 relative to the sun
00:01:58 even when it’s behind clouds.
00:02:01 A clock in their antennae adjusts their heading
00:02:04 as the sun moves across the sky.
00:02:09 Monarchs also have an annual clock
00:02:12 that tells them when to begin their journey
00:02:14 back to Mexico before the weather turns too cold.
00:02:18 But the trip home is not so easy.
00:02:21 They’ll need more than efficient flying
00:02:23 and good navigation to succeed
00:02:25 because this generation
00:02:28 will fly the entire journey back,
00:02:30 stretching over almost 3,000 miles.
00:02:34 The monarchs prepare for their journey
00:02:36 in an unexpected way.
00:02:38 They stop producing eggs temporarily
00:02:41 and instead build muscle and store fat.
00:02:44 They grow larger,
00:02:46 can fly almost ten times as far,
00:02:48 and live up to eight times as long.
00:02:51 They’re a butterfly “super generation.”
00:02:56 Their compass heading flips from north to south.
00:02:59 And off they go.
00:03:02 In about two months,
00:03:04 they arrive back
00:03:05 to their point of origin in Mexico
00:03:08 —a place neither they nor their parents,
00:03:11 grandparents,
00:03:13 nor perhaps even their great-grandparents
00:03:15 have ever seen.
00:03:17 Researchers hope that a better understanding of the monarch butterfly
00:03:21 will help create efficient, long-range, micro-air vehicles.
00:03:25 What do you think?
00:03:27 Did the monarch butterfly’s ability
00:03:29 to migrate long distances evolve?
00:03:32 Or was it designed?

It was made in secret,

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hidden in the lining of a jacket,

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:12.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then smuggled out of the country.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A recording
of brothers and sisters in Siberia

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
singing Kingdom songs.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent it from one side
of the earth to the other 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be played at the 1958
international convention in New York

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an audience of more than 250,000 people.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is singing so important
to Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out in this episode
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s worshippers

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have long praised him with song.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did singing become

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a part of our modern-day worship?

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story begins more than 150 years ago.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year is about 1869

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charles Taze Russell

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a young man
searching for Scriptural truth.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:25.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One evening he’s walking along
and hears something

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—singing coming from a religious meeting
being held in a basement.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He goes in, and what he hears sparks a fire

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bible study like never before.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Russell and his associates

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make music’s role in pure worship clear

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they rediscover Bible truth.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charles Taze Russell

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have come to appreciate

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the power of music can stir emotions

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a music business
that his father owned for a period of time.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He believed that “the singing of the truth

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a good way to get it into the heads

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hearts of God’s people.”

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first issue of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower,</i>

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:15.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published in July of 1879,

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:17.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
announced a songbook

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the first of many to come.

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was called <i>Songs of the Bride.</i>

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contained 144 hymns,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or religious songs of praise.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students sang
at their meetings and assemblies.

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it like to sing
these songs back in the early 1900’s?

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:43.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that you’re
at one of Charles Taze Russell’s lectures. 

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:47.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you walk in,
you’re handed a small sheet of paper.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look for a seat, but it’s packed.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the crowd quiets down,

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they announce that the meeting
will start with a song and prayer.

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:01.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a church,
you expect to find a hymn book in your pew,

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is a rented hall.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you realize
that the paper you were handed

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has the song lyrics,

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it also has a place
to leave your name and address

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:15.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’d like a Bible study.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the audience
starts to sing, you join in.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did songs sound like back then?

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:28.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s listen to a song
we sang for over eight decades.

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a recording from 1916.

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:40.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a little different than how

00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our songs sound today.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compare different versions of this song,

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:47.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll notice that the lyrics

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:50.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theme changed over the years.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a version of <i>“</i>All Hail”

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:56.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Watch Tower Male Quartet in 1935.

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:11.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first songbook this song was called

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:14.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name,”

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was about, well,

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:18.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of Jesus’ name

00:04:18.237 --> 00:04:20.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with zero mention of Jehovah.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, many songs prior to this

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were adapted from existing church hymns.

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:30.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s the same song in 1950.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:32.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of the lyrics

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overemphasizing Jesus’ name,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lyrics refer to “making known God’s will”

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:42.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mention Jehovah by name.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why all the changes?

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our songs reflect

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our current understanding
of Scriptural truth.

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:57.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the light gets brighter,

00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:00.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we understand the truth more clearly,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the songs change.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first songbook explained

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:06.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explained the goal to publish 

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:11.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“songs free from objectionable theology,”

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s been the case ever since.

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t hold on to songs

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for tradition or nostalgia.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sing them because it’s the truth!

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:27.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the 1928 songbook onward,

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:29.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a big shift.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many songs were written
by our brothers and sisters.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They put more emphasis on Jehovah’s name,

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:39.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his attributes, and his Kingdom.

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:41.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can even tell by the title 

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Songs of Praise to Jehovah.</i>

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the songs might even sound familiar,

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:49.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this one.

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:03.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are your parents in the truth?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your grandparents?

00:06:05.093 --> 00:06:07.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even your great-grandparents?

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:11.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, they sang the same song as you

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at their meetings and assemblies.

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:17.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a real legacy!

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s fast-forward to the 1940’s.

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:23.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our brothers
were imprisoned for their faith.

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:27.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world was at war and needed good news.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we intensified

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:31.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our preaching and teaching work.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is when
the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Theocratic Ministry School started,

00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:41.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s also when
singing was reintroduced at our meetings.

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait a minute!

00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:47.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reintroduced?

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:50.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we stopped singing at meetings.

00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:52.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When?

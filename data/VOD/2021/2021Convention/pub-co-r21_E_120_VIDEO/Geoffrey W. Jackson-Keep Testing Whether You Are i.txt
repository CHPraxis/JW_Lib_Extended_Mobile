00:00:01 Do you own a car or a motorbike
00:00:04 or some other type of vehicle?
00:00:07 If you do, you realize that it brings with it
00:00:10 a serious responsibility.
00:00:13 Initially, it costs quite a bit of money to buy a vehicle,
00:00:16 but also you need to keep on spending money to keep it running.
00:00:22 In addition to that, there is another serious responsibility
00:00:26 that comes with owning a vehicle.
00:00:28 And that is the responsibility to maintain it safely
00:00:33 so that it doesn’t break down, doesn’t cause accidents
00:00:37 and, most important, doesn’t cause loss of life.
00:00:42 Of course, if you have a maintenance program,
00:00:45 you’re not just going to wait for something to fall off the vehicle
00:00:49 or perhaps for it just to stop.
00:00:51 But, rather, ahead of time, you have to have a checklist
00:00:55 to see that everything is working properly.
00:01:00 Well, in a similar way, spiritually speaking,
00:01:04 each one of us needs a maintenance program
00:01:07 with regard to our spirituality.
00:01:10 What sort of maintenance program are we talking about?
00:01:13 Well, let’s take our Bibles, please,
00:01:15 and turn to the second book of Corinthians
00:01:18 chapter 13 and verse 5,
00:01:22 2 Corinthians 13:5;
00:01:28 there it says:
00:01:30 “Keep testing whether you are in the faith;
00:01:34 “keep proving what you yourselves are.
00:01:38 “Or do you not recognize that Jesus Christ is in union with you?
00:01:43 Unless you are disapproved.”
00:01:46 So notice right in the beginning of that verse, it says
00:01:49 to “keep testing” and “keep proving.”
00:01:53 What does that really mean?
00:01:56 Well, if you look at the study note associated with verse 5,
00:02:00 it tells us this:
00:02:02 “One lexicon states that the word Paul here uses for ‘testing’
00:02:07 “means ‘to endeavor to discover
00:02:10 “the nature or character of someth[ing].’
00:02:13 “They could discover the nature of their own spiritual standing
00:02:17 “by comparing their daily conduct, attitudes, and decisions
00:02:22 “with the sacred truths they were taught.
00:02:25 “Doing such testing would help them
00:02:28 “to keep proving that they were true Christians.
00:02:31 “For ‘proving,’ Paul uses a word
00:02:35 “that could refer to testing whether something is genuine,
00:02:38 as one might test metals.”
00:02:41 Do we see the point of what this verse tells us?
00:02:46 As Christians, we need to ‘keep testing continually
00:02:50 that we’re in the faith.’
00:02:52 But now, what does this word “faith” mean in this context?
00:02:56 It’s not just referring to the quality of faith
00:03:00 but, rather, it involves all the Christian teachings
00:03:05 that we find in God’s Word, the Bible.
00:03:08 So having that in mind, “keep testing” and “keep proving” really mean
00:03:13 that we need to look at ourselves
00:03:16 and see if we’re really living up
00:03:18 to what the Bible tells us to do.
00:03:21 Now, that’s a very serious maintenance program.
00:03:25 But just as we do a maintenance program for a vehicle
00:03:29 and we might have a checklist,
00:03:32 is there a checklist that we can use
00:03:34 when we’re testing and proving that we’re in the faith?
00:03:38 Yes, there is.
00:03:39 We can say there are three things.
00:03:42 First of all, we need to ask
00:03:45 heart-searching questions about our relationship with Jehovah.
00:03:50 That’s the first point:
00:03:52 Ask the questions that will search through our heart.
00:03:56 Second, we have to answer honestly.
00:04:01 Yes, whatever we see as an answer to those questions,
00:04:04 then we need to have a correct answer.
00:04:08 And then, finally, we need to seek Jehovah’s help
00:04:12 in making whatever adjustments we need to make
00:04:15 so that we can maintain our spirituality
00:04:18 strong and in good standing
00:04:21 so that our relationship with Jehovah is good.
00:04:26 So with that in mind, let’s go back to the illustration we started with
00:04:31 —a vehicle, a car, or a motorbike.
00:04:35 If you were to compare
00:04:37 our Christian faith or our beliefs or our conduct
00:04:42 to a vehicle and the need to maintain it,
00:04:45 what sort of things would you make as a comparison?
00:04:49 Well, perhaps the first thing we might think about is the engine.
00:04:53 You certainly need to make sure the engine works correctly
00:04:57 because that’s what gives the vehicle the power to keep moving.
00:05:01 So it’s good for us to ask the question,
00:05:05 What is it that moves us or motivates us
00:05:09 so that we serve Jehovah acceptably?
00:05:13 Well, the answer is found in the Scriptures.
00:05:15 And if we turn together to the first book of Timothy
00:05:19 chapter 4 and verse 8
00:05:23 —that’s 1 Timothy 4:8—
00:05:28 see if you can discern what it is that we could liken
00:05:33 to the engine in a car.
00:05:35 It tells us:
00:05:37 “For physical training is beneficial for a little,
00:05:42 “but godly devotion is beneficial for all things,
00:05:47 “as it holds promise of the life now
00:05:50 and the life that is to come.”
00:05:54 Did you see what the scripture tells us is so important?
00:05:58 Godly devotion.
00:06:01 But we need to understand what godly devotion is.
00:06:04 In fact, we also need to appreciate
00:06:07 this beautiful expression in the New World Translation.
00:06:11 Many other Bibles just simply translate this
00:06:15 as “godliness”—“godliness is beneficial.”
00:06:19 Or perhaps they say “godly training”
00:06:23 or “being religious,”
00:06:26 or even one version says “mental training.”
00:06:30 But the New World Translation  captures
00:06:33 the meaning of the original word here,
00:06:35 because you can train, or program, a robot
00:06:39 to do a certain job,
00:06:42 but you can’t program it to have godly devotion.
00:06:46 Why not?
00:06:47 Because godly devotion involves how we feel about Jehovah.
00:06:52 It means our loyalty to him
00:06:54 based on a heart full of love and appreciation.
00:06:59 So when it says godly devotion is important,
00:07:03 it really involves why  we do things,
00:07:07 not just what  we do.
00:07:10 Well, let’s think back to our illustration of the vehicle.
00:07:15 You want to test the engine.
00:07:18 What would you do to check the engine to see if it’s OK?
00:07:23 Well, one thing you might do is keep an eye on the temperature gauge,
00:07:27 because if the engine is overheating, you know there’s a problem.
00:07:31 Or perhaps you might check the oil to see if there’s enough oil.
00:07:36 Or you may check to see if you’ve changed the oil regularly enough.
00:07:41 Or when the engine is idling,
00:07:44 you might listen carefully to it
00:07:46 to see if it’s running smoothly or roughly
00:07:50 and, of course, you’d be interested if there are any strange sounds or noises.
00:07:55 So that’s the type of thing you would have on a checklist
00:07:58 when you’re trying to see if an engine is working properly.
00:08:04 Now, none of that applies to godly devotion, does it?
00:08:07 But what could be on our checklist
00:08:10 for us to test godly devotion
00:08:13 to see if it’s healthy and strong or not?
00:08:17 Well, again, the Bible helps us.
00:08:20 If you turn with me this time to the book of Psalms,
00:08:24 let’s look at Psalm 40:8
00:08:29 —that’s Psalm 40:8.
00:08:34 Here it tells us: “To do your will, O my God,
00:08:38 “is my delight,
00:08:41 and your law is deep within me.”
00:08:45 Now, this is a test of our godly devotion.
00:08:49 How so?
00:08:51 Well, we need to ask ourselves:
00:08:54 ‘Is my service to God something that I really delight in,
00:08:59 ‘or is it simply a chore?
00:09:01 ‘Is it something that I do as a mere routine
00:09:05 ‘—something that I just keep on doing regularly
00:09:08 but don’t really have a strong desire to accomplish?’
00:09:14 Well, if we were thinking
00:09:17 that our godly devotion was not so good, not so strong,
00:09:21 and perhaps we were just doing things out of routine
00:09:24 rather than for our love for Jehovah,
00:09:27 we need to take action,
00:09:29 just the same as if we heard that the engine had a knocking sound
00:09:34 or if we saw that it was overheating.
00:09:38 And that’s exactly what Jesus told the brothers
00:09:41 back in the first century in the congregation in Ephesus.
00:09:46 Please turn with me to the book of Revelation,
00:09:50 Revelation chapter 2.
00:09:53 And you’ll remember that this section of the book of Revelation
00:09:57 has a series of messages that Jesus gives to different congregations.
00:10:02 Now, the first congregation mentioned is in Ephesus.
00:10:07 If you look at chapter 2 of Revelation
00:10:09 and if we glance through verses 2 and 3,
00:10:13 what do you notice?
00:10:15 Well, Jesus says to the brothers:
00:10:17 “I know your deeds, and your labor and endurance.”
00:10:20 That sounds good, doesn’t it?
00:10:22 Then he goes on to say that they didn’t “tolerate bad men.”
00:10:27 And then in verse 3, he mentions that they “persevered”
00:10:31 and that they “[had] not grown weary.”
00:10:34 So, what do we assume from these two verses?
00:10:37 That our brothers back then in the first century
00:10:40 in the congregation in Ephesus
00:10:42 were busy doing the work of Jehovah.
00:10:46 Yes, they were active.
00:10:48 They weren’t giving up.
00:10:50 But then what does Jesus say in verse 4?
00:10:54 “Nevertheless, I hold this against you,
00:10:58 that you have left the love you had at first.”
00:11:03 Do we see the point?
00:11:05 Clearly, it shows us that Jehovah and Jesus
00:11:09 are not just interested in what  we do
00:11:13 but also why  we do it.
00:11:17 Yes, they want us to serve our God, Jehovah,
00:11:22 in a way that shows that we love him and that we’re loyal to him,
00:11:25 just the same as Jesus loves his Father
00:11:28 and is loyal to him.
00:11:31 And this is so important!
00:11:33 The apostle Paul highlighted this.
00:11:35 If you turn with me, please, to 1 Corinthians chapter 13,
00:11:41 1 Corinthians chapter 13,
00:11:43 and notice what Paul says under inspiration
00:11:47 in verse 3:
00:11:50 “And if I give all my belongings to feed others,
00:11:55 “and if I hand over my body so that I may boast,
00:11:59 “but [I] do not have love,
00:12:02 I do not benefit at all.”
00:12:07 Now, if we look across at the study note on this verse,
00:12:11 notice that it says:
00:12:13 “Speaking hypothetically,
00:12:16 “Paul says that if instead of love,
00:12:18 “such pride were his motive,
00:12:21 “he would give everything he owned to feed others
00:12:25 “or would even die a martyr’s death as a witness to the truth,
00:12:29 but he would not benefit at all.”
00:12:34 Isn’t that food for thought?
00:12:37 So thinking about this expression, “godly devotion,”
00:12:41 it’s interesting that one Bible scholar
00:12:43 defined the original word this way:
00:12:46 He said that it is “a very practical awareness of God
00:12:51 in every aspect of life.”
00:12:54 So if we were to check our godly devotion
00:12:58 and we see that perhaps it’s not really working
00:13:03 as well as it should,
00:13:05 maybe it needs maintenance.
00:13:07 What sort of maintenance would we give it?
00:13:11 Well, surely we would need to think of Jehovah
00:13:14 more often every day
00:13:16 to see him as part of our life.
00:13:20 Also, meditating on what Jehovah has done for us
00:13:23 builds up appreciation and love for him,
00:13:27 and that motivates us
00:13:29 to do what Jehovah wants us to do out of love,
00:13:33 yes, a heart full of appreciation.
00:13:37 And, of course, offering prayers regularly to Jehovah
00:13:41 helps to strengthen that relationship.
00:13:45 So, what have we learned so far in our discussion?
00:13:48 Well, just like the engine of a vehicle needs to be maintained,
00:13:53 we need to be aware of whether or not it’s operating correctly.
00:13:57 In a similar way, we need to ask ourselves
00:14:00 honest questions
00:14:02 —questions that search our hearts
00:14:05 with regard to our godly devotion:
00:14:09 ‘Is our service to Jehovah
00:14:11 ‘based simply on routine and a sense of duty?
00:14:15 ‘Do we view it just as a chore,
00:14:17 ‘or does our heart show
00:14:21 that it’s filled with appreciation and love for Jehovah?’
00:14:25 Well, if we build up that appreciation —that love—
00:14:28 we can be sure that our godly devotion is good.
00:14:32 Yes, it’s well maintained.
00:14:35 So that’s the first point of comparison that we’d like to make
00:14:39 in the maintenance schedule for a vehicle
00:14:42 and for our spirituality.
00:14:45 So let’s think of another comparison.
00:14:48 Another very important part of any vehicle
00:14:51 is the brakes.
00:14:53 Now, when we think of the brakes,
00:14:55 they’re absolutely necessary —aren’t they?—
00:14:57 because someone could jump in front of your vehicle.
00:15:01 There could be someone who perhaps is coming too quickly,
00:15:06 and you have to avoid them,
00:15:08 and you need to use those brakes.
00:15:11 So, what do you think we could compare the brakes to
00:15:15 with regard to our service to Jehovah
00:15:18 and our relationship with him?
00:15:20 Well, the Bible gives us a clue.
00:15:22 As we read Psalm 111,
00:15:26 we’ll see the answer to that question.
00:15:28 So as we turn there to Psalm 111,
00:15:32 let’s see what verse 10 tells us:
00:15:37 “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.
00:15:42 “All those observing his orders show good insight.
00:15:47 His praise endures forever.”
00:15:51 So do you see what could be likened
00:15:54 to the brakes of a vehicle?
00:15:57 What is it that stops us
00:15:59 from doing something that displeases Jehovah?
00:16:03 It’s our fear of Jehovah.
00:16:06 So just as you need to maintain the brakes in a vehicle,
00:16:11 we also need to make sure that our love for Jehovah
00:16:14 and our fear of Jehovah
00:16:16 is strong and well maintained.
00:16:19 Now, of course, we need to think: ‘What do we mean by fear of Jehovah?
00:16:23 ‘Do we mean shaking all the time,
00:16:25 worried that he’s going to do something wrong to us?’
00:16:28 No.
00:16:29 Perhaps we could liken it to a chef
00:16:32 who has a razor-sharp knife.
00:16:35 Now, this knife, when used properly,
00:16:37 can help him to attain all sorts of wonderful things.
00:16:41 But if he misuses it, then he has a problem.
00:16:46 So, in a similar way, if our relationship is strong with Jehovah,
00:16:50 there’s no need for us to be shaking in our boots, as it were.
00:16:53 But, rather, we need to remember always that Jehovah is with us.
00:16:58 And so a healthy fear of Jehovah
00:17:01 means that we don’t want to displease him in any way.
00:17:06 So a fear of Jehovah helps us so that as we’re moving along,
00:17:10 if anything comes our way,
00:17:13 we’re ready to stop
00:17:15 if we shouldn’t engage in that activity.
00:17:19 So let’s think for a few moments about the maintenance check for the brakes.
00:17:24 What would you do?
00:17:26 How would you check if the brakes are OK or not?
00:17:29 Well, mechanics tell us
00:17:31 that if you’re applying pressure to the brakes
00:17:33 and you find the steering wheel is starting to shake,
00:17:37 that’s a sign that maybe they need attention.
00:17:40 Or if you apply pressure to the brakes
00:17:44 and the vehicle starts to veer off to one side,
00:17:47 again, it’s not a good sign.
00:17:51 Or as you press the brake pedal,
00:17:54 if you find there’s very little resistance and you have to start pumping it,
00:17:58 again, that’s a problem.
00:18:01 And, of course, like with the engine,
00:18:03 if you start to hear strange, grinding noises,
00:18:07 that is never a good sign, is it?
00:18:11 Well, what about our fear of Jehovah?
00:18:14 How can we test whether or not
00:18:18 our fear of Jehovah is at the right level?
00:18:22 Well, we know that Satan and his world
00:18:24 constantly throw things at us:
00:18:27 temptations, wrong thinking, and so on.
00:18:31 So it’s just like when you’re driving in a vehicle
00:18:33 and someone jumps out in front of you or an animal runs across the road
00:18:38 —that’s when we need those brakes.
00:18:41 But how do we apply them?
00:18:44 How does our godly fear help us?
00:18:47 Well, let’s turn to the book of 2 Corinthians
00:18:51 and see a very interesting point
00:18:53 that is mentioned to the brothers back there in Corinth.
00:18:57 So 2 Corinthians chapter 10
00:19:00 and we’re going to look at verse 5.
00:19:03 Now, the context of this chapter
00:19:06 is where Paul is talking about wrong teachings.
00:19:10 But the principle as outlined in this verse
00:19:13 can be applied also to our reaction
00:19:16 to wrong thoughts and immoral thoughts
00:19:19 or all sorts of things that are not in harmony with Jehovah’s will.
00:19:24 So let’s see if we can see what the principle is,
00:19:27 2 Corinthians 10:5:
00:19:32 “For we are overturning reasonings
00:19:35 “and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God,
00:19:39 “and we are bringing every thought into captivity
00:19:44 to make it obedient to the Christ.”
00:19:48 So do we see the point?
00:19:50 No matter what sort of thought it is
00:19:53 —if it’s an immoral thought,
00:19:55 a temptation to do something wrong,
00:19:58 something that’s not neutral with regard to the political situation—
00:20:03 what does it say here?
00:20:04 We have to react quickly.
00:20:06 It’s just as if we put on the brakes.
00:20:10 Yes, we have to overturn all these sort of things
00:20:13 that could be going on in our mind.
00:20:16 So, obviously, it’s important for us
00:20:18 to test our godly fear in the sense of thinking:
00:20:22 ‘How do I normally react
00:20:25 ‘if I’m faced with a situation that perhaps tempts me?
00:20:29 ‘Am I quick to react?
00:20:31 ‘Do the brakes work properly,
00:20:34 or is my godly fear compromised?’
00:20:37 —an interesting question.
00:20:40 Also, another illustration: Just imagine that in your car
00:20:45 you find a whole lot of poisonous spiders.
00:20:48 Well, that’s not good, is it?
00:20:51 Of course, you’d get someone to help you get rid of those spiders.
00:20:55 Now, after you’ve paid that person to do the job,
00:20:58 how would you feel if they said: “Well, we got most of them.
00:21:00 There could be one or two left”?
00:21:03 I don’t think you’d be very happy —would you?—
00:21:05 because you want all of those poisonous spiders
00:21:08 out of the car.
00:21:10 But what does it tell us here in verse 5?
00:21:13 It says that we have to get
00:21:16 all the things that are out of harmony with Jehovah
00:21:20 under control.
00:21:22 Yes, we could find that even though
00:21:25 most of the things are under control,
00:21:28 there could be just a few areas
00:21:30 where we haven’t gotten them under control.
00:21:33 It could even be that it’s
00:21:35 as if we’re going in the wrong direction.
00:21:38 Well, what do you need to do if you find out
00:21:41 you’re driving on the highway in the wrong direction?
00:21:44 Stop, turn around, and go the opposite direction.
00:21:49 So isn’t that exactly what we should do
00:21:51 when it comes to this matter of checking our godly fear?
00:21:56 Yes, if we see that in any way
00:21:59 we’re a little slow in reacting
00:22:02 when immoral temptations come our way or other wrong thinking,
00:22:06 then we need to strengthen our fear of Jehovah.
00:22:09 Yes, our fear of Jehovah helps us to resist these things.
00:22:14 Now, what’s something that can help to strengthen our fear of Jehovah?
00:22:19 Well, again, the Bible gives us an indication.
00:22:22 This time, we find it in the book of Proverbs,
00:22:27 Proverbs 8:13.
00:22:31 And you’ll notice that this is a little definition, or formula, for us.
00:22:37 Proverbs 8:13:
00:22:41 “The fear of Jehovah
00:22:44 means the hating of bad.”
00:22:48 So, what is it that can help us strengthen our fear of Jehovah?
00:22:52 We need to hate what is bad.
00:22:56 Now, for a moment, let me ask you this question:
00:22:59 Is there some type of food that you really hate?
00:23:03 I know I can think of a couple of things that I just really can’t eat,
00:23:08 and I hate them.
00:23:11 If someone tries to tempt you to eat that food,
00:23:14 are you going to give in easily?
00:23:16 Of course not, because you hate that type of food.
00:23:20 Well, how much more important it is for us
00:23:23 to develop within ourselves a hatred
00:23:26 for what is bad.
00:23:28 Yes, we have to make sure
00:23:30 that when we see things that Jehovah hates,
00:23:34 that we feel the same way —that we don’t accept them.
00:23:37 Never would we allow gradualism
00:23:40 to change our feelings
00:23:42 with regard to what Jehovah says is wrong.
00:23:47 Now, as we read on, looking back at Proverbs 8:13,
00:23:52 notice it says: “The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad.”
00:23:56 Then it says: “I hate self-exaltation and pride
00:24:02 and the evil way and perverse speech.”
00:24:06 So we need to make sure that we take out of our hearts
00:24:11 any sort of pride
00:24:13 that could interfere with our relationship with Jehovah.
00:24:18 That’s very important, and that’s part of hating what Jehovah hates.
00:24:23 Just think for a moment: As we’re doing this checklist
00:24:26 to see how our fear of Jehovah is —is it strong or weak?—
00:24:31 we need to think:
00:24:33 ‘What things do I really feel proud about?’
00:24:37 Is there something deep inside you that you feel,
00:24:40 ‘Mmm, yes, I feel really proud about this’?
00:24:45 Well, never forget David’s son Absalom.
00:24:50 He was proud about his hair.
00:24:53 But in the end, it was his hair that caused him the problem,
00:24:56 and he ended up dying because of his hair being caught in the branches.
00:25:01 So never would we want to be like Absalom
00:25:04 and allow the thing that we are proud of
00:25:07 to actually cause us a serious problem.
00:25:11 So that’s been interesting —hasn’t it?—
00:25:14 looking at a second comparison
00:25:16 between the maintenance of a car
00:25:19 and the maintenance of our godly fear.
00:25:23 Just like the brakes,
00:25:25 godly fear can help us to stop
00:25:28 before we do something that would displease Jehovah.
00:25:33 Now, of course, when we’re thinking of this matter
00:25:35 of comparing the maintenance of a vehicle
00:25:39 with the maintenance of our spirituality,
00:25:41 there are so many different comparisons that we could make.
00:25:46 And your mind is probably already going there thinking,
00:25:49 ‘Well, will we make this comparison or that one?’
00:25:52 But we only have time for one more comparison.
00:25:55 And you probably won’t think of the one that we’re going to talk about
00:25:59 —that is, the horn.
00:26:02 You see, in some parts of the world, drivers say
00:26:05 that the horn is just as important as the brakes.
00:26:08 Why?
00:26:10 Because they need to let people know they’re driving along the road.
00:26:14 It could be that someone is beside them
00:26:16 and they’re about to change lanes and crash into them.
00:26:19 Well, the horn can help.
00:26:21 Or it could be that someone is distracted and they’re crossing the road.
00:26:25 Again, the horn will help.
00:26:28 So a horn used correctly
00:26:31 can save lives.
00:26:33 So, what do you think we’re going to compare the horn to
00:26:36 with regard to our spiritual activities?
00:26:40 Well, if we read 1 Timothy together,
00:26:43 1 Timothy 4:16,
00:26:48 we’ll see what the comparison is.
00:26:51 First Timothy 4:16:
00:26:57 “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.
00:27:01 “Persevere in these things, for by doing this
00:27:05 you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”
00:27:10 So we could say
00:27:12 that just as a horn is important with regard to a vehicle,
00:27:17 likewise our sounding out the message of the good news
00:27:22 —our teaching others and telling them about the nearness of Jehovah’s day—
00:27:27 can result in lives being saved.
00:27:31 But now, if you were to check a horn,
00:27:34 what would you be looking for or perhaps more importantly listening to?
00:27:39 Well, for a start, you’d try to test the horn and honk it.
00:27:43 Now, if no sound comes out, you know you have a problem.
00:27:46 Or, on the other hand, if the sound is too soft
00:27:50 that nobody can hear it,
00:27:52 that likewise is a problem.
00:27:55 So, what about us?
00:27:57 Do we need to think
00:28:00 about how our proclamation of “the good news” is?
00:28:02 Yes!
00:28:04 Let’s take not just the normal activities we’re involved with with our preaching work,
00:28:09 but what about informal witnessing?
00:28:11 Do you see the opportunity?
00:28:13 You think, ‘Yes, I need to talk to this person,’
00:28:17 and
00:28:18 nothing happens.
00:28:21 The horn is not working in a symbolic sense.
00:28:25 Or perhaps we do have the opportunity and we take it,
00:28:28 but the message is not clear.
00:28:32 So persons don’t really understand what we’re saying.
00:28:36 So if either of those were the case,
00:28:39 we’d need to see that maintenance is required
00:28:43 with regard to this symbolic horn.
00:28:46 What would we do?
00:28:48 Well, it could involve praying to Jehovah
00:28:50 for courage —yes, boldness—
00:28:53 to be able to witness to others,
00:28:55 whether it’s informally, telephone witnessing,
00:28:58 or other forms of witnessing.
00:29:01 And then if we’re not so clear, or coherent,
00:29:04 with regard to how we present the message,
00:29:07 how important it is for us to practice ahead of time,
00:29:11 to have special sessions where we practice what we’ll say!
00:29:15 And then in this way, we can be ready to give a clear message
00:29:19 to those who listen.
00:29:22 Well, that’s been a very interesting exercise, hasn’t it?
00:29:25 What did we see?
00:29:27 If we’re using this comparison, this illustration, of a vehicle,
00:29:31 we could say that the engine of a vehicle
00:29:33 is like our godly devotion.
00:29:37 Our devotion to Jehovah needs to come from our hearts.
00:29:41 And the brakes of a vehicle
00:29:43 we could liken to our fear of Jehovah.
00:29:45 Yes, if we hate what is bad the same as Jehovah does,
00:29:49 it will stop us, just like brakes do.
00:29:52 And then finally, we discussed this matter of having a horn
00:29:57 that sounds the message properly.
00:29:59 Yes, we need to make sure that we ask for Jehovah’s help
00:30:02 to maintain our witnessing in such a way
00:30:06 that we can clearly help others to hear the message.
00:30:10 So as we’ve gone through this, I’m sure (as we’ve already mentioned)
00:30:13 you can think of many other comparisons.
00:30:16 But the point is
00:30:19 that a wise driver
00:30:21 does not just drive his car
00:30:25 or motorbike or whatever vehicle it is.
00:30:29 A wise driver also checks to make sure
00:30:33 that the vehicle is safe to use.
00:30:36 So likewise for us,
00:30:38 as 2 Corinthians 13:5 says,
00:30:41 we need to “keep testing.”
00:30:44 Yes, we need to “keep proving” that we are in the faith.
00:30:48 In other words, keep checking that we really are Christians,
00:30:52 that we are really living up to what we believe
00:30:55 and what we teach others to do.
00:30:58 But remember, what is it that can be a problem for us?
00:31:03 Well, again, if we turn to the book of Corinthians,
00:31:05 this time 1 Corinthians
00:31:08 chapter 10 and verse 12,
00:31:11 we’ll see what the problem can be.
00:31:15 That’s 1 Corinthians 10:12:
00:31:20 “Let the one who thinks he is standing
00:31:24 beware that he does not fall.”
00:31:27 Yes, just thinking everything is OK (there are no problems)
00:31:32 and thinking that we’re just going on fine
00:31:35 without testing ourselves and proving that we’re in the truth
00:31:40 —that can be a problem,
00:31:42 just like lack of maintenance to a vehicle
00:31:45 can result in not only damage with regard to the vehicle
00:31:49 but also loss of life.
00:31:51 How important then it is that we continue to keep testing
00:31:56 whether or not we are in the faith, or in the truth!
00:32:01 So if we do these tests regularly
00:32:04 and if we check to see: How is our godly devotion going?
00:32:07 How is our fear of Jehovah? our hatred for what is bad?
00:32:11 How is our sounding out of the message going?
00:32:14 If we see some weaknesses,
00:32:18 what do we need to do?
00:32:20 Well, our final scripture takes us back to our theme scripture.
00:32:24 Remember, that was 2 Corinthians 13:5,
00:32:29 where it says: “Keep testing . . . keep proving
00:32:33 what you yourselves are.”
00:32:37 But then if we look down a little further to verse 11,
00:32:42 we’ll notice what it tells us that we need to do
00:32:46 if we see some problems.
00:32:49 In verse 11, it tells us:
00:32:51 “Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice,
00:32:56 to be readjusted.”
00:33:00 Now, what does it mean “to be readjusted”?
00:33:03 Well, if you look at verse 9,
00:33:05 you see the same expression is used there
00:33:08 at the end of verse 9.
00:33:10 And the study note to that verse tells us this:
00:33:13 It says the word is “used to describe
00:33:16 “the restoring of something to a proper condition.
00:33:20 “For instance, at Mt 4:21,
00:33:23 the [word] . . . is used to describe ‘mending’ nets.”
00:33:26 So nets that are damaged or have holes in them
00:33:29 —mending them is just like readjusting them.
00:33:33 At Galatians 6:1, the same verb is used
00:33:36 for the need to spiritually readjust
00:33:38 a fellow believer who has taken a false step.
00:33:42 The term is sometimes used in medical text
00:33:46 to describe the setting of a bone, a limb, or a joint.
00:33:51 So, what’s the point?
00:33:53 If we do this checklist —go through it—
00:33:56 and we see that somehow
00:33:58 our godly devotion is not as strong as it should be
00:34:02 and we are just doing things out of routine
00:34:04 but our love for Jehovah is no longer strong,
00:34:07 or if we find that our fear of Jehovah
00:34:09 is not stopping us from doing what is wrong,
00:34:13 or if we are finding that we just are not
00:34:16 thoroughly bearing witness to the good news,
00:34:19 then we need to take action.
00:34:21 What does it involve?
00:34:23 Well, as it says here,
00:34:25 first of all, identifying what the problem is
00:34:28 and then readjusting, repairing,
00:34:31 and (in some places) replacing activities.
00:34:35 So, brothers and sisters, let’s always remember
00:34:39 that no matter how long we’ve been in the truth,
00:34:41 no matter what privileges we have,
00:34:44 we need to keep looking at that checklist.
00:34:47 Yes, we need to “keep testing” and “proving”
00:34:51 that we are  in the faith.

00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:06.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have relatives
who are presently not serving Jehovah?

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:08.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think most of us do.

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re not alone.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even our Lord Jesus
had that same circumstance.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though his half brothers knew
about the miracles he was performing,

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says that they were not

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was so bad
—can you imagine?—

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when Jesus was being put to death,

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:34.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it appears that his brothers were not there.

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the account
when Jesus was on the torture stake

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he looked down at the disciple

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked him basically
to become responsible for His mother?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t there to support Him.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened just a short while

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after Jesus had been resurrected?

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was amazing

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because some of those
half brothers were found,

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with Jesus’ mother,
with the disciples fervently praying.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt?

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine the joy
he must have experienced

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them now beginning to express faith?

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe you’ve had that experience too.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe one of your relatives

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe your mate,
one of your children, one of your siblings—

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has now come to serve Jehovah.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyful feeling!

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, nothing could compare to it.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was it

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped Jesus’ half brothers
to go from being faithless

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to putting faith in him?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can you
and I learn from that example?

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address that question.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that helped
Jesus’ brothers to acquire faith?

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:55.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s the number one thing:

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was patient with his relatives.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an important point,

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because look at how Jesus
was treated by his relatives.

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:10.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you look with me at Mark 3:21?

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:15.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says there:
“But when his relatives heard about it,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they went out to seize him,

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for they were saying:
‘He has gone out of his mind.’”

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not take offense

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though his relatives
were trying to seize him

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even though they said he had gone crazy.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:35.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have your relatives perhaps
said some things like that to you?

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:37.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not take offense.

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was patient.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in fact, after his resurrection,
look at what Jesus did.

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together verse 7.

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “After that he appeared to James,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then to all the apostles.”

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:01.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is just a very small detail,
but did you notice what it said?

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “[Jesus] appeared to James.”

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:10.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, we don’t know what Jesus
said to James when He appeared to him.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is
that Jesus made a special effort

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appear to His half brother James.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, James must have deeply appreciated

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that special attention from Jesus.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do we say that?

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, James went on to become

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a respected elder
in the congregation in Jerusalem.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, you may remember
that in Acts chapter 15,

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the apostles and older men
gathered in Jerusalem

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:43.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to consider the matter about circumcision,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that James was the one
who was presiding at that meeting.

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:50.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what had happened?

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James had gone from being a faithless person

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:58.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to now being a pillar in the congregation.

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:01.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James and His other half brother Jude

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both had the privilege of writing letters

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:09.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were included
in the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, in the following video,

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please take careful note

00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:17.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what helped a family member
to be a person with faith.

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:25.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth came to our home
through my mother.

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was never seriously interested
in the truth.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we grew up,
education was very important.

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:35.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person needed to make money
and live a lavish life.

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:39.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the life I chose

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to study, to get higher education—

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could have what others had.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although they could see
that I wasn’t interested in the truth,

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother and brother did not give up on me.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back from school in January, 

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:57.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother ordered the <i>Examining</i>
<i>the Scriptures Daily</i>  booklet for me.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:03.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Year after year, I always had
the <i>Examining the Scriptures Daily </i> booklet

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Bible.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:09.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She made sure
that although I wasn’t attending meetings,

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least I had literature.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:17.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides that, my younger brother,
the one I was close to,

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:21.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided to take the truth seriously.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:23.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back from school,

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:26.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw my brother
getting a Bible study of his own,

00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was surprised to see him

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
studying the Bible
and noticed that he had prepared.

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:36.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cared about
and loved what he was learning.

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:40.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I understood
that the Bible changes lives.

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that comes to mind

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:47.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Hosea 11:4.

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:50.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it shows that Jehovah

00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:54.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pulls us with “cords of love” and “kindness.”

00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:57.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my situation, Jehovah did this.

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:02.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I made the decision to be regular
at the congregation meetings,

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:07.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I finally started studying
the Bible with someone in 2007

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:09.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got baptized in 2008.

00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:13.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family really encouraged me;

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.312 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they never gave up on me.

00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:17.314 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I encourage parents

00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:19.358 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not to give up on their children.

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:25.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must continue encouraging them
and have the hope

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:28.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God
will draw them to the organization

00:06:28.575 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have good hearts.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters, we want

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:40.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that same experience for our relatives.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:45.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to help them to grow in faith?

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s talk briefly about three things.

00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:50.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first one:

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be patient with your relatives.

00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:58.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to imitate the example
of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when the nation of Israel
went astray so many times?

00:07:03.193 --> 00:07:06.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in Jeremiah chapter 44,

00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says that Jehovah sent his prophets

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“again and again.”

00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:15.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very patient with his people.

00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:18.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be patient with our relatives too.

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:20.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t give up on them.

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:24.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then second, we want to be tactful.

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:29.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to look for ways that we
can stimulate their interest in the truth.

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it’s true, Jesus described
the message of the truth

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like “water” that could
lead to “everlasting life.”

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But have you ever tried
to drink from a fire hydrant?

00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:43.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very difficult thing to do.

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want our relatives to choke

00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:50.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re forcing too much information

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:52.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with too much force, or power.

00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:54.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,

00:07:54.578 --> 00:07:59.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want our relatives
to feel refreshed by the truth.

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:03.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whether our relatives
feel choked or refreshed

00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:07.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will really depend on how we
go about explaining the truth to them.

00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be tactful and speak
to them in a loving way

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:14.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will stimulate their interest.

00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:17.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to that third point:

00:08:17.642 --> 00:08:19.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to show empathy

00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:24.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our relatives
and let our conduct speak for us.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when we first learn the truth,

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:29.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relatives may not be sure of how this

00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:32.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now going to affect
our relationship with them.

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:37.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of thinking of many,
many different things that we could say,

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:40.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important to remember that what we do

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:43.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to speak far more loudly

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:45.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the things that we say.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, there is a saying that says:

00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:51.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’d rather see a sermon than hear one.”

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:53.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:57.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister named Pauline realized
that instead of talking to her husband

00:08:57.224 --> 00:09:01.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much about the truth,
she needed to set a good example.

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:04.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when her husband
observed the good effect

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible was having on his wife
and on his children,

00:09:08.151 --> 00:09:12.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was the thing that opened
his mind and opened his heart

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the message of the good news.

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just don’t know, brothers and sisters,

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good effect of your conduct,
of your example, on your relatives.

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:24.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, about two years ago,

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was out in California
at a regional convention

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a sister came up to me with two brothers.

00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, she had been raised

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:36.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by her faithful mother in the truth,

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had gone away
from the truth for more than 30 years.

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:44.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She watched a broadcast,
and she was moved to return.

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:46.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She then reached out to her brother

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was also away from the truth
for more than 30 years.

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He decided to come back too.

00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:56.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the two of them
reached out to their other brother

00:09:56.074 --> 00:10:00.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was also away for more than 30 years,
and he also came back.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the three of them were in front of me.

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:05.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the sister said:

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:08.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think my mother is going to have
to be resurrected twice.

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:12.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were all out of the truth when she died.

00:10:12.674 --> 00:10:15.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When she sees us in the new world,

00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:19.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she’ll be so shocked that I’m sure
she’ll need to be resurrected again.”

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:25.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good example
of their mother stayed with them

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:29.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even long after their mother had passed away.

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:31.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:10:31.109 --> 00:10:35.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can use you to help your relatives.

00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might be faithless right now,

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:41.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with your help,
they can become full of faith.

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:44.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It worked in the case of Jesus,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can work for you too.

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:51.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the next talk
of this symposium,

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:58.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember—Faithless People
Can Acquire Faith!

00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:00.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Prominent Ones.”

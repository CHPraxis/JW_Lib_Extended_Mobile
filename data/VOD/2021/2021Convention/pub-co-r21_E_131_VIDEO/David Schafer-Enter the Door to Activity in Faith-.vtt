Can you see faith?

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to Mark chapter 2,

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what the Bible says about this.

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this account, Jesus is teaching
in a crowded house in Capernaum,

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Mark 2:2-5 he tells us:

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And so many gathered

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there was no more room,
not even around the door,

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he began to speak the word to them.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they brought him a paralytic
carried by four men.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But they could not bring him right to Jesus
because of the crowd,

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so they removed the roof above Jesus,

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and after digging an opening,

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they lowered the stretcher
on which the paralytic was lying.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Jesus saw their faith,

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said to the paralytic:
‘Child, your sins are forgiven.’”

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, faith can be seen.

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s seen in the way we act.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like other invisible things,
faith is measured by its effects.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, James 2:26 says

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “faith without works is dead.”

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is, Can others see my faith?

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What effect is my faith

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
producing in me?

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One effect that faith has on people

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it moves them to expand
their activity in Kingdom service.

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul expressed this

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 16:9:

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because a large door that leads to activity

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been opened to me,
but there are many opposers.”

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul took advantage
of such opportunities to show his faith.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has Jehovah opened
the door to activity for you?

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,
we’re going to discuss five ways

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which a temporary opportunity
leading to great activity

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making disciples might present itself.

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be in the form
of learning a new language,

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:11.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moving to where the need is greater,

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assisting with a theocratic building project,

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or donating generously
to support the Kingdom work.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:26.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is faith needed
to seize such opportunities,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what blessings do we receive when we do?

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, why is faith needed

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn a new language
in order to make disciples?

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to Zechariah chapter 8

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Zechariah chapter 8.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes faith

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:48.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discern that current events
are fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes faith to understand 

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we can act in harmony with God’s purpose

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as revealed in that prophecy.

00:02:56.572 --> 00:03:00.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zechariah 8:22 says:

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And many peoples and mighty nations

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:09.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will come to seek
Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem 

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to beg for the favor of Jehovah.”

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 23 says:
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:20.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘In those days ten men

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘out of all the languages of the nations

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will take hold, yes, they will take
firm hold of the robe of a Jew,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘saying: “We want to go with you,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for we have heard
that God is with you people.”’”

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:37.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ten men”

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:42.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people who recognize that the only way
to gain Jehovah’s approval

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:44.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to associate
with those who already have it.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “Jew” is also referred to here
as “you people.”

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which people?

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, not the people
who refuse to pronounce God’s name

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or those who remove it altogether
from their Bible translations.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:58.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This refers to those who worship 

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah by name

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:07.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spirit-anointed Christians,
“the Israel of God”

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:10.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referred to at Galatians 6:16.

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:14.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because ten
can represent earthly completeness,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “ten men” represent all men and women

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have the hope of living forever on earth.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice that they come
not simply from all the nations

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but from “all the languages of the nations”

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:31.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to learn Jehovah’s requirements.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how will they hear

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:38.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the voice of the “Jew” in their language?

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:41.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That might just be

00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your door to activity.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some might hesitate
to learn a new language.

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they hold back because of the time
and energy that are required.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others feel that they lack the ability.

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while it’s true
that before making any decision

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:57.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to calculate the expense,

00:04:57.109 --> 00:05:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the question here is one of faith.

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:03.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can the God who gave ability to Bezalel,

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who made the sun stand still for Joshua,

00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:10.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who gave power to Samson
also give you the ability,

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time, and energy to help those

00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are begging for the favor of Jehovah?

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Matthew 17:20:

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:24.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith
the size of a mustard grain, . . .

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:27.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:29.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And according to Philippians 2:13,

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:33.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holy spirit can give us even “the desire”

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:36.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach to those
who speak another language.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that spirit drawing you now?

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:43.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, too, that through his organization,

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:47.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides much help
for those who are learning a new language.

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:49.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW.ORG contains reading material,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
audio recordings, and videos

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:55.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more languages than any other website.

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:58.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we have the <i>JW Language </i> app

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and language classes
arranged by the branch office.

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:04.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When faith motivates us

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sacrifices to serve Jehovah,

00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:11.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will help us to succeed
and he will reward us

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many blessings.

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:18.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, a couple in their 60’s
kept finding Chinese people

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:21.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who accepted their invitations
to attend congregation meetings.

00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:24.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they decided to learn Chinese,

00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and within ten years, they studied

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 112 Chinese people.

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, but with so many languages,

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:36.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do I know
which language to start learning?

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:39.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zechariah 8:22,

00:06:39.044 --> 00:06:42.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is ‘begging for the favor of Jehovah’?

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can learn about the needs in your area

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by consulting with the elders
and the circuit overseer.

00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:52.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how one couple

00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:55.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responds to a need in the field.

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, honestly, you shouldn’t have.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to need it.

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:14.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gabriel’s leaving to serve where 

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:17.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need is greater made us feel like we

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:20.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had missed the chance to expand our ministry.

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:25.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we start now?

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:27.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not getting any younger.

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:28.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:30.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could ask the circuit overseer for advice

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:34.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his next visit,
but I’m worried he’s going to say

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should . . .

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:38.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . join the new language group.

00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a big need in our circuit.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve never felt like the right people

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:46.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve in a foreign language.

00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lindstrom
shared Zechariah 8:23 with us,

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:53.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helped us see how we could have a hand

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping “men out of all
the languages of the nations”

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:58.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn about Jehovah.

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:09.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning was a struggle at first.

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:20.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help, we made progress

00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—slowly.

00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!
You did it!

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:43.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the language was a challenge,

00:08:44.753 --> 00:08:46.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving our new family was not.

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, uhh.

00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:20.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t—I don’t understand.

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:28.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say again what you say.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, uh.

00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:42.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:45.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank—thank you!

00:09:48.608 --> 00:09:51.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we aren’t getting any younger.

00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:56.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why we’re so glad

00:09:56.533 --> 00:10:00.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we took the chance to expand our ministry.

00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:09.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Elliott and Corrine
showed faith and how they were blessed?

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:12.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They talked to their circuit overseer,

00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:15.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who revealed a big need
in a foreign-language group in their circuit.

00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:19.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then showed them Zechariah 8:23.

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:22.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They read that scripture again later,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they prayed about it together,

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:28.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then came
the measurable effect of their faith.

00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:30.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They put forth great efforts to learn.

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, with humility and courage,
they used their new language skills

00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:36.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the meetings and in the ministry,

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:39.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were able to help those

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:42.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were ‘begging for the favor of Jehovah.’

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:44.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how it works.

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:46.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simple?

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:50.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, but if we invest the time and effort

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:53.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn a new language
in order to do more for Jehovah,

00:10:53.048 --> 00:10:56.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be confident
that Jehovah will bless us

00:10:56.384 --> 00:10:58.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a rewarding ministry.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a couple from Britain said:

00:11:00.972 --> 00:11:03.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The ministry in the foreign-language field

00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:06.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is one of the most exciting
we have experienced

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:10.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during our 40 years of Kingdom service.”

00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:12.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did they do it?

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:15.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because people who are seeking Jehovah

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:19.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to hear his requirements for life
in words they can understand.

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:24.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During a meeting held in Vietnamese,
a man stood up

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:27.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said with tears in his eyes:

00:11:27.082 --> 00:11:29.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you, thank you for the efforts

00:11:29.751 --> 00:11:32.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you are making
to learn my difficult language.

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:34.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am so grateful to learn

00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:38.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many wonderful things
from the Bible in my old age.”

00:11:38.677 --> 00:11:42.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After attending a circuit assembly
in his native Albanian,

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:46.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man in his 70’s
living in New York City, said:

00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:49.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the best day of my life!”

00:11:49.896 --> 00:11:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made arrangements
that very day to start studying the Bible

00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:55.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a pioneer who had learned his language,

00:11:55.694 --> 00:12:00.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and within just a few years,
he began serving as a ministerial servant.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are blessings for exercising faith.

00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:10.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is measured by the way we act.

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:13.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you enter
this door to activity in faith?

00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:17.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Samuel Herd,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider the next talk
of this symposium,

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:23.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Move to Where the Need Is Greater.”

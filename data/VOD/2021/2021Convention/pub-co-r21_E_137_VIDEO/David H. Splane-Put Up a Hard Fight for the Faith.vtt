00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith”!

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those are the words of Jude,
the half brother of Jesus,

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s important to consider them
in their context.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Jude 3,
and then leave your Bibles open

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re going
to consider another verse in Jude,

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this will help us
to get the point that Jude was making.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Jude 3,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:
“Beloved ones,

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“although I was making
every effort to write you

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about the salvation we hold in common,

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:42.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I found it necessary to write you

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:47.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to urge you to put up
a hard fight for the faith.”

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jude himself

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been “[putting] up
a hard fight for the faith.”

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider this:
Just three years earlier,

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own fleshly brother James

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was stoned to death
at the order of High Priest Ananias.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an open attack on God’s people,

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:12.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it must have been
very painful to Jude and to others.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here is something interesting:

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jude is not warning his brothers

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about High Priest Ananias
or about persecution.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has something else in mind,

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a different type of attack,
and this is a sneaky one.

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at verse 4,
and we’ll see why he wrote his letter.

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that the very first words are
“my reason is.”

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So this is what I have in mind
when I’m writing you brothers.’

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:45.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My reason is that certain men
have slipped in among you

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were long ago appointed
to this judgment by the Scriptures.”

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jude is talking about false brothers

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are presenting a real danger
to the congregations

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in some ways,
a greater danger than outright persecution.

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice what Jude said
about those false brothers?

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had “slipped in.”

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were sneaky.

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was true back then,
and it’s true today, as we’ll see.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers, this is a very serious matter
that we’re considering today.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of this:

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was the Christian congregation
brought down by persecution

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the second and third centuries?

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was brought down by false brothers

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apostate teachings.

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the Devil can use an outright attack.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can use persecution

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to batter the structure
of the Christian congregation.

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:50.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes he uses rot from within,

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a subtle means to attack us.

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever method he uses,
we have to fight.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:03:00.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our faith is involved,
and our faith is worth fighting for.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a gift from Jehovah.

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:03.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to hold on to it.

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a product of his holy spirit.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to put up
a hard fight for our faith.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this talk,
we’re not going to discuss persecution.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to discuss
two of the subtle means

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan uses to weaken our faith:

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apostasy

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and negative reports
about Jehovah’s Witnesses in the media.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So first, let’s talk about apostasy,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll call it spiritual poison.

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about poison.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the best way to avoid being poisoned?

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:43.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have to recognize poison
when we see it, and then avoid it.

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the same principle applies

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:49.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teachings that could destroy our faith.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s not always easy.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, not many of our brothers and sisters

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would deliberately get involved
with apostates,

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:59.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it could happen without our realizing it.

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:03.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We receive letters at times
from brothers and sisters

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are troubled by something
they saw on a web page,

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an accusation, a rumor about the Society,
or about the organization.

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:13.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the problem is,

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had no idea
that apostates were behind it.

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:20.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s tricky
because the apostates don’t advertise,

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:23.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are now on an apostate web page.”

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They often pose as sincere Witnesses

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who just have questions or concerns.

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some who aren’t really apostates

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:34.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause just as much trouble
as the apostates do

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their negative talk and criticism.

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, we need to be on the alert.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is serious.

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose that out of curiosity

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you get into a discussion forum
with individuals

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:50.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe they are, maybe they aren’t.

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t know.
You’ve never met them.

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someone starts asking questions:

00:04:56.608 --> 00:04:59.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What did you think
of last month’s broadcast?

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:02.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you really find it encouraging?”

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “Do you think the brothers
who write <i>Watchtower</i>  articles

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are living in the real world?

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:10.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wonder if they realize
just how hard it is out here.”

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then a few others join in
with their own negative comments.

00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:18.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you don’t know
whether these individuals are apostates

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just brothers and sisters
who are in serious spiritual trouble.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does it matter?

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does it make you feel?

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:29.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you leave the forum,
do you feel upbuilt,

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
determined to expand your ministry,

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:35.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more convinced than ever that Jehovah
has an organization that you love

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you’re delighted to be a part of?

00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:41.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you feel honored
to be a part of that organization?

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:45.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or does the experience leave you sad,

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:48.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uneasy, uncomfortable?

00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:51.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, someone might say,

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I need to get involved in that forum
so that I can help those people.”

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:57.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They shouldn’t be together.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if they aren’t apostates,
they’re not good for one another.

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:05.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Staying in that forum to “help someone”

00:06:05.302 --> 00:06:07.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like holding his hand
while he drinks poison

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:11.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then having some yourself
so that he doesn’t have to drink alone.

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:13.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to follow the advice

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded at Romans 16:17.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about this imaginary forum
that we just described

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:26.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the light of Romans 16:17.

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:28.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
there are all kinds of negative talk

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:30.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flying around in this forum;

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:32.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t know who’s behind it.

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:37.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s what it says at Romans 16:17:

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I urge you, brothers,
to keep your eye

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on those who create divisions

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:49.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and causes for stumbling

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:52.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“contrary to the teaching
that you have learned,

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid them.”

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:57.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about that forum.

00:06:57.187 --> 00:07:00.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it create divisions?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:03.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it a cause for stumbling?

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:05.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could be.

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:07.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it contrary to what we have learned?

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:10.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we even have to answer that question?

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:15.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, whether it’s intended or not,
the effect will be to weaken our faith.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we do?

00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:19.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Paul tell us to do
here at the end of verse 17?

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:21.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Avoid them.”

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:26.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’d like to say a kind word

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:29.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to some who may be involved
in discussion forums.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may like to use this medium
to blow off steam, so to speak.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe there are
little things in the congregation

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:38.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are happening
that you wonder about

00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:40.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or decisions the elders have made

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:43.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you wonder about,
and so you write.

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:45.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get involved in the forum,
and you blow off steam,

00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:48.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after that, you feel better.

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:50.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about others in the forum?

00:07:50.824 --> 00:07:52.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they feel?

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:56.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t you feel awful
if negative comments you made

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:59.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were responsible
for someone leaving the truth?

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:01.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you wouldn’t want that to happen.

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:06.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please, please,
be careful about what you say.

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:09.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another person might say:

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:12.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, I can see where those warnings
about apostates apply to so-and-so.

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:14.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s weak,
but don’t worry about me.

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:16.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m spiritually strong.
I can handle it.”

00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:21.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s like a weight lifter thinking
that he can drink a vial of poison

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:25.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it won’t hurt him
because he’s so big and strong.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:29.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not so strong,
so spiritual, so intelligent

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can’t be affected
by the poison of apostate ideas.

00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:39.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when might we feel pressured

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:42.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read something
that the apostates have written?

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:44.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider this scenario:

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unbelieving husband of your Bible student

00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:51.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sends his wife a link
to an apostate web page and says,

00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:55.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here, you better look at this
and see what you’re getting into.”

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:57.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your student is concerned,

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:00.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she wants you to take a look
and tell her what you think.

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:02.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not an option.

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:05.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “Avoid them.”

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:09.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t mean reading apostate literature

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or searching social media
to see what they’re saying about us.

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:14.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you say to your student?

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:18.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say something like this:

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can imagine
that this is very upsetting for you,

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:25.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you certainly do need to know
what you’re getting into.

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:27.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have a suggestion.

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have nothing to hide.

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:31.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you’re at the meetings,
listen carefully

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:33.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to what the brothers are saying.

00:09:33.218 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Watch how we interact with one another.

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:39.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take note
of how the organization is financed.

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:41.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Get to know the elders and their wives.

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Introduce yourself to the circuit overseer
and his wife when they come.

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Visit world headquarters or the branch.

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:49.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ll come with you.
I’ll help you.

00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:53.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I want you to get really acquainted
with the organization.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:56.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And if you do,
I’m sure you’ll soon realize

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:59.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what these people
are saying about us isn’t true.”

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:04.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe you can think of a better answer,
but you get the idea.

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:09.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few drops of poison in a drink

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:12.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are enough to cause serious harm.

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And apostates
often mix a few truths with lies.

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Eliphaz,
one of Job’s false comforters?

00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:22.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of what he said was true.

00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:26.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Job 5:13.

00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:33.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job chapter 5 (I’ll give you a moment)
and verse 13.

00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:36.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if what I read sounds familiar:

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:43.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He catches the wise in their own cunning,

00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:47.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the plans of the shrewd
are thwarted.”

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:51.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He catches the wise in their own cunning.”

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that sound familiar?

00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:54.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, yes.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:58.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul said the very same thing
at 1 Corinthians 3:19.

00:10:58.428 --> 00:11:00.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the marginal reference,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see (in the little <i>a</i>  in the middle there)

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:05.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians 3:19.

00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul may even have been quoting Eliphaz.

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:12.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was a truth.

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:17.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did Jehovah feel
about Eliphaz’s argument overall?

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Job 42:7

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:24.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how Jehovah felt about it.

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:27.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 42:7:

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job,

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:36.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite:

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:40.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My anger burns against you
and your two companions,

00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:42.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you have not spoken
the truth about me

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:46.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as my servant Job has.’”

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:50.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few grains of truth
were mixed in with falsehoods,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:55.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at least some of what Eliphaz said
was inspired by the demons.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know that?

00:11:56.653 --> 00:11:58.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He admitted it.

00:11:58.113 --> 00:12:02.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Job 4:15-17.

00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.
This is interesting.

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:10.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 4:15-17,

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:17.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliphaz says:
“A spirit passed over my face;

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:19.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the hair of my flesh bristled.

00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:21.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It then stood still,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I did not recognize its appearance.”

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s stop there for a second.

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:30.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I did not recognize its appearance.”

00:12:30.228 --> 00:12:33.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he didn’t know whom he was talking to,

00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:38.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like someone in a discussion forum
may not know whom he is talking to.

00:12:38.778 --> 00:12:41.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue; he says:

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:45.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A form was in front of my eyes;
there was a calm,

00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:48.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then I heard a voice:

00:12:48.705 --> 00:12:51.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Can a mortal man
be more righteous than God?

00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:54.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can a man
be cleaner than his own Maker?’”

00:12:55.837 --> 00:12:59.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it surprise you
that a demon would get involved

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:02.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the debate
between Job and the false comforters?

00:13:02.302 --> 00:13:03.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shouldn’t.

00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:05.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was no small debate.

00:13:05.096 --> 00:13:06.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big issue.

00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:10.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan had challenged Jehovah
in the presence of all the angels

00:13:10.894 --> 00:13:14.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no man
would keep his integrity under test.

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:17.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That demon was using Eliphaz

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:20.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to demoralize Job and weaken his faith.

00:13:20.612 --> 00:13:25.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was something that Job had to fight for,
and Job fought back.

00:13:27.118 --> 00:13:30.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apostates are more active in some places
than they are in others.

00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:34.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if there’s a lot of apostate activity
in your area,

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:36.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people in the territory may be listening

00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:39.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may challenge you
when you meet them in the ministry.

00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:41.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how should you handle it?

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:45.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t try to argue with the apostates;

00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:47.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t read their comments.

00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:50.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask the elders
or other experienced publishers

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for suggestions
on how to answer the householders.

00:13:54.896 --> 00:13:59.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how poisonous are apostate teachings?

00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:03.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out
as we watch the following video.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:09.494 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was in my 40’s, I was divorced,

00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:12.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had three younger kids at home,

00:14:12.372 --> 00:14:14.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working three jobs,

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had drifted away from the congregation.

00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had an acquaintance who was telling me

00:14:21.798 --> 00:14:24.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was in a cult

00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:27.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I needed to look

00:14:27.262 --> 00:14:29.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at some information that he had.

00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was about 30 years old,

00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:34.686 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a fellow employee saw

00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:36.271 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:38.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and was trying to access jw.org.

00:14:38.565 --> 00:14:41.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told me about someone
he knew in another country

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:43.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could prove to me
that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:14:43.528 --> 00:14:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t have the truth.

00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:47.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me curious,

00:14:47.407 --> 00:14:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and little by little, I was persuaded to look

00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:51.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at apostate material.

00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:55.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born and raised in the truth,

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:00.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the age of 16,

00:15:00.128 --> 00:15:01.880 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but I began to associate with people

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who had either formerly been associated

00:15:04.132 --> 00:15:05.133 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the truth

00:15:05.133 --> 00:15:09.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or were very loosely associated
with Jehovah and his organization,

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:13.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s really where the apostasy
began to take root.

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:17.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was reading this literature,

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:19.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw through it to an extent,

00:15:20.732 --> 00:15:22.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you’re drifting away,

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:25.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re looking for a reason not to believe.

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:28.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to feed my mind

00:15:28.823 --> 00:15:31.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with different philosophies, different ideas.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even studied different religions.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, I told myself
that I was doing that academically,

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:41.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it started to influence the way

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:43.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I thought and felt about things.

00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:47.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the elders reached out to me.

00:15:47.217 --> 00:15:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very combative with those brothers.

00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even made the accusation
that Noah’s ark was

00:15:54.557 --> 00:15:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fairy tale,
that it was part of mythology.

00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:01.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those apostate doubts that I was reading

00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:04.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.

00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:06.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped reading the publications,

00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:08.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped going to the meetings,

00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result,
my spiritual routine was dead.

00:16:11.574 --> 00:16:14.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I’d try to find truth elsewhere.

00:16:14.118 --> 00:16:16.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I looked for something out there that was

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with what I knew the Bible taught.

00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I couldn’t find anything.

00:16:22.126 --> 00:16:26.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Sunday morning,
I rode by the Kingdom Hall,

00:16:26.005 --> 00:16:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said to myself,

00:16:28.007 --> 00:16:30.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, they’re all in there
waiting for Armageddon.’

00:16:30.802 --> 00:16:33.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately when I thought that thought,

00:16:33.346 --> 00:16:34.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to myself:

00:16:34.973 --> 00:16:37.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, at least they
feel good about themselves.

00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:39.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel?’

00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:42.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer was I felt terrible.

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:47.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, by skillful use of the Scriptures
and just reasoning with me,

00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:49.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders got me to realize

00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:51.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had been ‘carried off’

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that I had been ‘taken captive’
by human philosophy,

00:16:55.368 --> 00:16:57.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the deceptions

00:16:57.662 --> 00:16:59.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the empty reasoning of men.

00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:04.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually said a prayer;
I supplicated Jehovah

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:06.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would really show me
the way to the truth.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took away

00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:11.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this feeling of emptiness,
spiritually speaking.

00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that a relationship with Jehovah

00:17:16.306 --> 00:17:19.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s our most precious possession.

00:17:19.434 --> 00:17:21.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to get back.

00:17:21.853 --> 00:17:24.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible with sincerity.

00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart,

00:17:27.483 --> 00:17:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted it to effect
change in my behavior.

00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now as I did that,
I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts.

00:17:34.282 --> 00:17:38.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to help me
to rebuild that relationship with him.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I began to use Jehovah’s name.

00:17:42.332 --> 00:17:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy

00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:47.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a great pleasure to me.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result was that my ministry
was very productive.

00:17:49.881 --> 00:17:51.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s an amazing joy

00:17:51.883 --> 00:17:55.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to help someone
come to love Jehovah.

00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just so happy

00:17:57.847 --> 00:18:00.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be back under Jehovah’s wings

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have that peace of mind.

00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:04.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How loving Jehovah is!

00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:05.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to help us.

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what better helper could we have?

00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the best in the universe.

00:18:10.693 --> 00:18:14.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
the second challenge we face:

00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:18.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
negative reports
about Jehovah’s Witnesses in the media.

00:18:18.743 --> 00:18:20.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s a good principle to follow

00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:24.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 14:15.

00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:26.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs chapter 14

00:18:30.171 --> 00:18:34.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 15,

00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:39.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“The naive person believes every word,

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the shrewd one ponders each step.”

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:49.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people believe everything
they read in the newspaper or see on TV.

00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you?

00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:53.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should you?

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:56.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider this:
Now, you’re working from door to door,

00:18:56.864 --> 00:18:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you meet a householder who says:

00:18:58.866 --> 00:19:01.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You Jehovah’s Witnesses are terrible people.

00:19:01.202 --> 00:19:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You let your children die.
You don’t accept medical treatment.”

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you ask the householder,

00:19:06.749 --> 00:19:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know
any Jehovah’s Witnesses personally?”

00:19:09.585 --> 00:19:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No.”

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then where did you get the idea
that we let our children die

00:19:14.298 --> 00:19:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t accept medical treatment?”

00:19:16.926 --> 00:19:20.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The householder says:
“I have it on good authority.

00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:22.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it in the newspaper.”

00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:27.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if it’s in the newspaper,
it must be true, right?

00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:29.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember this:
Reporters have a deadline to meet,

00:19:33.317 --> 00:19:38.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a reporter may not have the time
or the inclination to check the facts.

00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:42.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or the reporter
may have written a balanced article,

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then the editor changes it.

00:19:44.495 --> 00:19:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe the editor
doesn’t like Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:19:47.123 --> 00:19:50.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or he’s been misinformed about us.

00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:52.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s bad enough if people in the world

00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:54.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
believe everything they read in the newspaper

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:57.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, brothers, let’s not be among them.

00:19:57.925 --> 00:20:02.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s not be naive;
let’s consider things carefully.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, sometimes there’s a TV program
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:20:09.312 --> 00:20:12.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a few of these programs
are balanced and fair.

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:16.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many or, I daresay, most are not.

00:20:16.694 --> 00:20:20.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they’re not, you’ll often find
that the producers started out

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:22.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a negative view of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:20:22.408 --> 00:20:26.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they looked for information
to support their prejudice.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whom did they turn to?

00:20:28.372 --> 00:20:30.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apostates and the clergy.

00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:34.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From them,
they got suggestions for people to interview.

00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:36.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know what those people would say.

00:20:36.714 --> 00:20:40.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the very last minute,
they may ask the brothers for a comment

00:20:40.218 --> 00:20:42.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to give an appearance of fairness,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the program wasn’t designed to be fair.

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:47.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was designed to be unfair.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was slanted against Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:20:51.938 --> 00:20:54.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s be clear.

00:20:54.107 --> 00:20:58.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some news organizations
are very conscientious about their reporting,

00:20:58.194 --> 00:21:01.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want to present
both sides of an issue.

00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:03.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And where Jehovah’s Witnesses
are concerned,

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:06.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they do so at their cost.

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:09.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a newspaper publishes
anything positive about us,

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:11.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the churches will push back.

00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:13.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Our parishioners are upset.

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:15.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They subscribe to your newspaper,

00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:18.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they don’t like reading favorable things
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.’

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:20.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The message:

00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:24.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If it ever happens again,
you’re going to lose subscribers.’

00:21:25.555 --> 00:21:29.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this matter of Jehovah’s people

00:21:29.308 --> 00:21:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being the subject of malicious reports
isn’t new.

00:21:33.062 --> 00:21:36.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the days of Queen Esther.

00:21:36.774 --> 00:21:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wicked Haman brings a bad report
to King Ahasuerus.

00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:43.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The Jews don’t obey our laws.

00:21:43.322 --> 00:21:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re a danger to society.’

00:21:45.908 --> 00:21:48.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Ahasuerus check the facts?

00:21:48.744 --> 00:21:50.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he demand proof?

00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:52.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:54.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ahasuerus is naive;

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:58.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he allows himself to be taken in by Haman.

00:21:59.172 --> 00:22:02.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are
a lot of modern-day Hamans today,

00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:05.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they use similar tactics.

00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
some government officials are taken in.

00:22:09.098 --> 00:22:13.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They believe the slanderous accusations
of the apostates.

00:22:13.394 --> 00:22:16.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if they just took the time
to check the facts,

00:22:16.522 --> 00:22:20.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’d see that they’re being lied to,
but they don’t check the facts.

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:23.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now again, it’s bad enough, brothers,

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:27.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when government officials
are taken in by false reports,

00:22:27.325 --> 00:22:29.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so don’t you be taken in.

00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:35.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever heard the expression
“trial by media”?

00:22:37.293 --> 00:22:40.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It works like this:
Someone is charged with a crime,

00:22:40.713 --> 00:22:43.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the case
is widely publicized in the media,

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:46.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the media
presents the case in such a way

00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:50.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that everyone who hears about it
thinks the man is guilty.

00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:54.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
to avoid a lawsuit for slander or libel,

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these media reports
are very carefully worded,

00:22:57.271 --> 00:22:59.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to understand
what the wording means.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a good principle to keep in mind

00:23:01.442 --> 00:23:05.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Job chapter 12

00:23:05.404 --> 00:23:07.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 11.

00:23:07.448 --> 00:23:09.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how many principles

00:23:09.784 --> 00:23:12.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can draw from the book of Job
for this talk.

00:23:12.286 --> 00:23:16.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 12:11,

00:23:16.749 --> 00:23:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is Job speaking and he says:

00:23:20.002 --> 00:23:23.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not the ear test out words

00:23:23.756 --> 00:23:26.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the tongue tastes food?”

00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:30.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not the ear test out words?”

00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:23:32.515 --> 00:23:37.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean that if we learn that apostates
are going to be featured on a TV program,

00:23:37.144 --> 00:23:40.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should watch it
to see if what they say is true?

00:23:40.398 --> 00:23:41.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It basically means
to consider the source of the words.

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:50.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are the words of apostates,
why would we believe them?

00:23:50.574 --> 00:23:52.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think of it this way:

00:23:52.743 --> 00:23:56.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a bottle on your shelf
that’s marked “poison.”

00:23:56.289 --> 00:24:00.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you need to open it up and take a swig
to see if it really is poison?

00:24:00.793 --> 00:24:04.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Believe what the label says.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for the purpose of this discussion,

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:09.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider another way
we can test out words

00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that is to pay attention
to what the words mean.

00:24:13.723 --> 00:24:16.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we talked about media reports

00:24:16.142 --> 00:24:19.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how these are very often carefully worded

00:24:19.312 --> 00:24:21.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid a lawsuit.

00:24:21.397 --> 00:24:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So suppose a report indicates

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:26.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone has been charged with a crime

00:24:26.277 --> 00:24:28.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he’s being investigated.

00:24:28.612 --> 00:24:33.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, you have two words:
charged and investigated.

00:24:33.242 --> 00:24:36.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t mean he’s guilty.

00:24:36.037 --> 00:24:40.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or suppose that someone
is convicted and put in jail.

00:24:40.583 --> 00:24:43.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that would apply
to our young brothers in Korea, wouldn’t it?

00:24:43.502 --> 00:24:45.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were convicted and jailed.

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:47.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was their crime?

00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:50.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They refused to kill someone.

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:53.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they do anything wrong?

00:24:53.471 --> 00:24:57.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if someone is found guilty by man,

00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:59.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus was,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t mean that he’s guilty
in the sight of God.

00:25:03.272 --> 00:25:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers,
we really have to think about these things.

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:10.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may read that a person
or an organization was sued

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then settled out of court.

00:25:13.532 --> 00:25:17.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does settling out of court
mean that they were guilty?

00:25:17.536 --> 00:25:19.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this country and others,
court cases are often handled by a jury.

00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:26.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, who are on the jury?

00:25:26.253 --> 00:25:28.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ordinary citizens with no legal training.

00:25:28.756 --> 00:25:31.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only that,
these ordinary citizens

00:25:31.842 --> 00:25:34.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t always have access to all the facts

00:25:34.428 --> 00:25:39.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the judge and lawyers decide
which facts will be shared with the jury,

00:25:39.016 --> 00:25:43.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s unlikely that the whole truth
will ever come out in court.

00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:48.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, neither side probably wants
the whole truth to come out in court.

00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:53.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes attorneys
deliberately withhold information

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be prejudicial to their clients.

00:25:55.991 --> 00:26:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in addition, the juries
have prejudices like everyone else,

00:26:00.162 --> 00:26:04.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them
just can’t set their prejudices aside.

00:26:05.584 --> 00:26:07.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you an actual experience.

00:26:07.878 --> 00:26:12.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago,
a lawyer told me about a case he had.

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:16.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a case
of medical malpractice by a doctor.

00:26:16.804 --> 00:26:18.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a jury.

00:26:18.222 --> 00:26:22.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at trial, the doctor was clearly shown
to be in the wrong

00:26:22.643 --> 00:26:26.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the jury didn’t give the patient a penny.

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lawyer was confused.

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:32.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after the trial,
he approached two of the jurors and asked,

00:26:32.987 --> 00:26:37.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you don’t mind, tell me which part
of the testimony you didn’t believe.”

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:40.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The jurors replied:
“Oh, we didn’t get that far.

00:26:40.286 --> 00:26:42.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The doctor was cute,

00:26:42.413 --> 00:26:45.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we didn’t want him
to have to pay anything.”

00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:47.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With deep thinkers like that,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no wonder many lawyers
try to settle their cases

00:26:50.212 --> 00:26:52.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than bring them to a jury.

00:26:53.674 --> 00:26:55.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But someone will say:

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:57.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, I don’t believe
in settling out of court.

00:26:57.428 --> 00:26:59.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe in justice and truth.”

00:26:59.847 --> 00:27:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that brings up the question,

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:06.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it wrong to settle a matter
before it goes to trial?

00:27:06.395 --> 00:27:08.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is it Scriptural?

00:27:08.397 --> 00:27:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s let Jesus answer that question.

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:15.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Matthew 5:25, 26.

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:24.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting
that Jesus should mention this

00:27:24.246 --> 00:27:28.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the important things
that Jesus taught.

00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:33.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:25, 26:

00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:37.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be quick to settle matters

00:27:37.426 --> 00:27:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with your legal opponent,

00:27:39.595 --> 00:27:42.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while you are with him on the way there,

00:27:42.473 --> 00:27:46.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that somehow the opponent
may not turn you over to the judge,

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the judge to the court attendant,

00:27:48.812 --> 00:27:50.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you get thrown into prison.

00:27:50.898 --> 00:27:52.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I say to you for a fact,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will certainly not come out of there

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you have paid over
your last small coin.”

00:28:00.616 --> 00:28:02.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is interesting.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the Mosaic Law.

00:28:04.995 --> 00:28:07.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there any provision in the Mosaic Law

00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:09.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to throw someone in jail
if he couldn’t pay a debt?

00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:11.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That wasn’t the way.

00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he couldn’t pay, he’d have to work it off

00:28:14.129 --> 00:28:16.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a family member would have to work it off.

00:28:16.882 --> 00:28:20.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jesus talks about prison and a judge,

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:24.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s obviously referring
to what a Gentile judge would do.

00:28:24.473 --> 00:28:27.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you couldn’t necessarily expect
justice from him.

00:28:27.935 --> 00:28:31.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why might he rule against our brother?

00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:34.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe he got paid
under the table by the other party.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe he was prejudiced

00:28:36.902 --> 00:28:41.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the race
or the religion of the other party.

00:28:41.657 --> 00:28:45.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice, Jesus didn’t say
that the man should settle

00:28:45.744 --> 00:28:48.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only if he was guilty.

00:28:48.038 --> 00:28:51.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, let’s not be naive;

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t believe everything you read.

00:28:53.877 --> 00:28:56.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just because an article
is called a news report

00:28:56.338 --> 00:28:58.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t make it true,

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an editorial is someone’s opinion

00:29:00.342 --> 00:29:02.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that someone may be wrong.

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:06.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And TV producers
may have their own agenda,

00:29:06.265 --> 00:29:09.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prejudice, and viewpoint.

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:15.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we say in conclusion?

00:29:15.983 --> 00:29:19.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our faith is under attack,

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have to fight.

00:29:21.614 --> 00:29:24.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah gives us
what we need to fight with.

00:29:24.533 --> 00:29:27.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things he gives us
is good associations.

00:29:27.995 --> 00:29:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will try to lure us
away from good associations.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll try to weaken our faith

00:29:32.708 --> 00:29:36.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by getting us involved in bad associations
without our knowing it,

00:29:36.587 --> 00:29:41.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah provides
good association in the congregation.

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:43.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are people we know.
These are people we love.

00:29:43.802 --> 00:29:47.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are people
who have our best interests at heart.

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:52.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind the principle we find
at Proverbs 13:20:

00:29:59.276 --> 00:30:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise,

00:30:03.947 --> 00:30:08.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one who has dealings with the stupid
will fare badly.”

00:30:08.577 --> 00:30:10.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the members of your congregation;

00:30:10.954 --> 00:30:12.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that they are wise;

00:30:12.956 --> 00:30:15.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that they have
your best interests at heart.

00:30:15.876 --> 00:30:18.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you get involved in a forum,

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might not know whether you’re walking
with wise persons or not

00:30:21.048 --> 00:30:23.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at least not at first.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:25.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be careful.

00:30:25.386 --> 00:30:28.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the conversation turns negative,

00:30:28.138 --> 00:30:30.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get out.

00:30:31.016 --> 00:30:36.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is behind
the twisted teachings of apostates.

00:30:36.021 --> 00:30:38.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is “the father of the lie.”

00:30:38.023 --> 00:30:42.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those who lie
are doing exactly what their father does.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostates have nothing
to offer us, brothers.

00:30:45.739 --> 00:30:47.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they have to offer is hate.

00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they have to offer
is criticism and negative talk.

00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, oh, how upbuilt we feel

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re with those who love Jehovah!

00:30:57.334 --> 00:31:01.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah provides us
with good, wholesome associations.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also provides us with his Word of truth,

00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an accurate knowledge of the truth

00:31:07.136 --> 00:31:09.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the best defense against apostasy.

00:31:09.513 --> 00:31:12.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the Bible every day and meditate on it.

00:31:12.182 --> 00:31:15.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay attention to the words;
pay attention to what they mean.

00:31:15.686 --> 00:31:20.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like the Beroeans
referred to at Acts chapter 17

00:31:20.691 --> 00:31:23.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 10 and 11.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that.

00:31:24.528 --> 00:31:29.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 17:10, 11:

00:31:31.452 --> 00:31:36.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately by night the brothers
sent both Paul and Silas to Beroea.

00:31:36.373 --> 00:31:39.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On arriving,
they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

00:31:39.668 --> 00:31:43.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now these were more noble-minded
than those in Thessalonica,

00:31:43.547 --> 00:31:47.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for they accepted the word
with the greatest eagerness of mind,

00:31:47.384 --> 00:31:51.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“carefully examining the Scriptures daily

00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:54.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[carefully examining the Scriptures daily]

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see whether these things were so.”

00:31:58.562 --> 00:32:03.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul compares the Beroeans
with the Thessalonians.

00:32:03.442 --> 00:32:05.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we know about the Thessalonians?

00:32:05.694 --> 00:32:08.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have YouTube in those days,

00:32:08.071 --> 00:32:11.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at one point, the Thessalonians
apparently heard a rumor

00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:14.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the day of Jehovah” had arrived.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who circulated the rumor?

00:32:16.663 --> 00:32:17.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An apostate?

00:32:17.956 --> 00:32:19.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe.

00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:21.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe it was just someone
who had heard the rumor

00:32:21.585 --> 00:32:24.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and passed it on without checking it out.

00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:26.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever done that

00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:29.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—passed on a report
without checking the facts?

00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:32.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of us have to admit

00:32:32.095 --> 00:32:35.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve been guilty of that
at one time or another.

00:32:35.098 --> 00:32:38.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
how did the Thessalonians react?

00:32:38.018 --> 00:32:39.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were alarmed.

00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:42.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were “quickly shaken
from [their] reason.”

00:32:42.439 --> 00:32:44.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We mustn’t let that happen to us.

00:32:44.942 --> 00:32:47.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hear something,
check it out;

00:32:47.486 --> 00:32:49.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t just circulate it;
don’t just believe it;

00:32:49.863 --> 00:32:51.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
check it out.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 2:6, 7

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:56.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the last scripture we’ll read
during this talk.

00:32:56.829 --> 00:32:59.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here Paul explains how we can avoid

00:32:59.832 --> 00:33:02.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being quickly shaken from our reason.

00:33:02.543 --> 00:33:04.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this final scripture.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 2:6, 7:

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:15.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, just as you
have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord,

00:33:15.097 --> 00:33:18.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“go on walking in union with him

00:33:18.308 --> 00:33:21.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[you do that, and you’ll be walking
with a wise one, certainly],

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“being rooted and built up in him

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then notice this]
and being stabilized in the faith,

00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:32.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as you were taught.”

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:36.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re “stabilized in the faith,”
we won’t be quickly shaken

00:33:36.451 --> 00:33:40.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by unfounded accusations
by apostates or the media.

00:33:42.124 --> 00:33:47.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
False rumors are often spread during wartime.

00:33:47.087 --> 00:33:50.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, this is war.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to put up a hard fight for the faith

00:33:53.176 --> 00:33:55.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if our life depended on it

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:57.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—because it does!

Have you ever stood on the ocean shore,

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoying the salt spray,

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching the breakers dash against the rocks

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or run up onto the sandy beach
then withdraw?

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many enjoy spending hours at the ocean.

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never stop marveling

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at its beauty and its immense size.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, many fear

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the destructive power of the ocean.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like other natural forces,
the ocean can act like a powerful giant

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sometimes goes on a rampage.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can man do to stop
the wall of water of a tsunami

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from approaching the coastline?

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The power of storm waves
is almost unbelievable.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have been known to throw
boulders weighing 7,000 pounds

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over a wall 20 feet high.

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we trust that Jehovah in the future

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will bring the oceans
and other natural forces

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into perfect balance?

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how the oceans
give loud and clear evidence

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s wisdom and power.

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions of cubic meters of water

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circulate continually around our planet.

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Near the poles, water that is colder,

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saltier, and denser sinks,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
creating a flow almost 100 times

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:55.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that of the Amazon River.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This drives a massive circulation of water

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may take 1,000 years to complete

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the global ocean conveyor belt.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This enormous system distributes heat,

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helps to stabilize the weather

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and transport great quantities

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:30.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of nutrients around the world

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:33.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that life

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may flourish in abundance.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah set these mechanisms in motion

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and understands them perfectly.

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You rule over the raging of the sea;

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when its waves surge, you calm them.”

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw in our video,

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:18.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the oceans are essential
to sustain life on the earth.

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, however, greedy men

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have trashed them with pollution.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Global warming has caused
ocean levels to rise,

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:30.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
threatening coastal areas.

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experts are concerned that the natural forces
are so out of balance

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:39.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that soon the planet
will no longer sustain life.

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, friends, if Jehovah had
the wisdom and power

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create the earth’s oceans,

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his time comes to bring
all natural forces back into perfect balance,

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can certainly cause us
to live in harmony with them.

00:03:57.174 --> 00:04:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though the oceans might appear
to be uncontrollable,

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that Jehovah is vastly more powerful.

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note how Psalm 93:4 describes his power,

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 93:4:

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Above the sound of many waters,

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“mightier than the breaking waves of the sea,

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:23.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is majestic in the heights.”

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the great sea may lift up
its powerful waves to heaven,

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:32.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is no match for our majestic,
Almighty God.

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:39.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s powerful ability
to perfectly control the oceans

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:41.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us great confidence

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is also perfectly capable

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:47.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of protecting us, his people.

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Jeremiah 5:22, notice how Jehovah

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds his people of his power.

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 5:22:

00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do you not fear me?’ declares Jehovah,

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:04.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Should you not tremble before me?

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is I who placed the sand

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘as the boundary for the sea,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘a permanent regulation
that it cannot pass over.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:18.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Although its waves toss,
they cannot prevail;

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although they roar,
they still cannot pass beyond it.’”

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Almighty God placed the sand

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:29.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the boundary for the sea.

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:33.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when its furious waves pound against sand,

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:37.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sand absorbs their impact
and the force vanishes.

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:41.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since Jehovah controls
the literal roaring sea

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:44.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from going beyond its boundaries,

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can he not also protect his people

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the wicked sea of humanity threatens us

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:52.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with its violent storms?

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:58.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s control over vast waters
was well demonstrated

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:00.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he protected the Israelites

00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:05.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by allowing them to cross
the Red Sea on dry land.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Red Sea has an average depth

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of over 1,600 feet.

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:15.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is estimated that at the point
where the Israelites crossed it,

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the depth of the sea was as much as 50 feet.

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:24.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine being an Israelite
walking through this corridor

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:27.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with walls of water on each side of you

00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:30.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 50 feet high.

00:06:30.577 --> 00:06:35.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Jehovah used
those same walls of water to collapse,

00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:38.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drowning their enemies, the Egyptians.

00:06:38.627 --> 00:06:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah controlled those vast waters

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:45.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver an entire nation
from a world power.

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:48.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you recall the account

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:52.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mark 4:37-39

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:55.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when God empowered his Son, Jesus,

00:06:55.894 --> 00:06:58.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to control the sea and the wind?

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus and the disciples
were crossing the Sea of Galilee in a boat,

00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:07.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great windstorm caused the sea to rage,

00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:10.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it threatened to fill up their boat.

00:07:10.534 --> 00:07:12.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus do?

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:17.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He commanded the wind and the sea
with the words, “Hush!

00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:19.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be quiet!”

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:23.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the raging wind and sea calmed down.

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on this occasion, Jesus showed
what he will do

00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as King of God’s Kingdom
during the millennium.

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:33.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will control forces of nature.

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:36.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be no need to fear the ocean.

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, disastrous storms

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:43.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are becoming more frequent and severe.

00:07:43.859 --> 00:07:46.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What used to be considered extreme

00:07:46.737 --> 00:07:51.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—massive floods, killer droughts,
and monster snow storms—

00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:54.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the new normal.

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:57.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many experts now put the blame
on human activity

00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has affected the oceans and the climate.

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:05.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, men continue to ruin
the earth today.

00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s the good news.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:10.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the millennium,
by means of his Kingdom,

00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:15.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wise Creator will undo
all the damage done by humans.

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:20.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything will function in harmony
with Jehovah’s principles,

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:24.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will learn how to properly care
for this beautiful planet.

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:29.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, everything will be brought back
into proper balance,

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:32.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the climate and the oceans.

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:38.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While some men today fear that the earth
will be destroyed because of man’s abuse,

00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:42.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives us this comforting promise

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:45.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 104:5,

00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:49.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 104:5:

00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He has established the earth
on its foundations;

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:58.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it will not be moved from its place

00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:01.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forever and ever.”

00:09:01.645 --> 00:09:05.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the beautiful, deep, and dark blue ocean

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:07.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will roll on forever.

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:10.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Creator will make sure of that.

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:13.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By our observing the oceans

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on what we see,

00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can build our faith that soon
we will enjoy Jehovah’s creation

00:09:20.247 --> 00:09:22.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forever without fear.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother James Mantz,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:31.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:35.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith—Forests.”

00:00:01.647 --> 00:00:04.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two Israelite men
sneak into the city of Jericho.

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:06.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The men are spies.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They take refuge in a place
where they feel no one will notice them

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the home of a prostitute, Rahab.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And little does Rahab know

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the visit
of these two men will affect her life.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But someone recognizes the spies,
and they notify the king.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king sends men
to take the spies into custody.

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the king’s men bang on the door,

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab is confronted
with a life-or-death decision

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a decision that will affect her livelihood

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the lives of everyone in her family.

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will she take a stand for Jehovah’s people,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or will she side with the king of Jericho?

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine the challenges that Rahab faced

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what helped her
to make a life-saving decision.

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jericho was doomed.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People were scared.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Israelite men showed up at my door,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was barely time to think.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew what was at stake.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even as a young girl,
I had heard all the stories.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wasn’t like the other gods.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had dried up the waters of the Red Sea

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given his people victory
over the Amorites.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I helped these men,
I knew Jehovah would help me.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time in my life,

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was standing with Jehovah’s people

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s side.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my faith was being rewarded.

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:52.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spies were probably
the first Israelites that Rahab had ever met.

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, she was convinced

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:58.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if she helped the two men,
Jehovah would help her.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did she feel that way?

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 31.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:10.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we find the answer
to that question in a single word.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:31 says:

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Rahab the prostitute

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not perish
with those who acted disobediently,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she received
the spies in a peaceable way.”

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Rahab took a decisive stand

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on her faith
in what she had heard about Jehovah

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how he had delivered
his people at the Red Sea

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:37.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he had given them
victories over nearby kings.

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in Joshua chapter 2

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes the significant sequence of events.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab had already hidden
the spies on her roof

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the king’s men arrived.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after sending the king’s men away,

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she went back up to the roof
to talk to the spies.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There she explained to them
the reasons for her faith,

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:05.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she expressed confidence
that Jehovah is the true God

00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah would give his people

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:11.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
victory over Jericho.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only then did she ask
the spies for protection

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for herself and her family.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Rahab’s faith
was not based on the promise of a reward.

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:28.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, her faith
was based on her firm conviction

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is the almighty God.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:36.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab’s faith gave her courage
to hide and protect the spies.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then her faith moved her

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey the spies’ unusual instructions.

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a young Bible student

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows faith like that of Rahab.

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no doubt about it.

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had found the truth.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:04.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why did I feel so anxious?

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:32.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They displease him.

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some changes in my life were easy to make.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I really needed Jehovah’s help
for what I had to do next.

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:10.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my mom so much.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I explained that I wouldn’t celebrate
the holidays anymore,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell that she was hurt.

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:29.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I was doing the right thing

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed that Jehovah
would help her understand.

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is going to be
a holiday season like no other

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like this 36 megapixel DSLR camera kit
for just $399.

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:48.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would you believe this 65” 4K UHD
Smart TV is only $849?

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:50.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry in before it’s gone because these . . .

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:14.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I admit I was surprised when she said
she wanted to learn more.

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing!

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, I had found the truth,

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now maybe my family would find it too.

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:32.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Rahab, this Bible student

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:35.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had already identified the true God.

00:06:35.374 --> 00:06:39.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was convinced
that she had found the truth.

00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:42.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now she needed to act on that faith,

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:47.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was blessed
when she took a stand on Jehovah’s side.

00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:51.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us must ask ourselves,

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I standing firmly on Jehovah’s side?’

00:06:55.852 --> 00:07:00.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you feel that you
don’t have enough knowledge to take a stand.

00:07:00.148 --> 00:07:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, imitate Rahab and do not hesitate.

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:08.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What little knowledge Rahab had about Jehovah

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was enough to give her faith

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:15.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that moved her
to take prompt, obedient action.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Rahab had to do more than protect
the spies and follow their instructions.

00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:23.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 2:25

00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:28.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
states that Rahab was
“declared righteous by [her] works.”

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:32.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, she was a prostitute

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:36.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a work that is not in harmony
with Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Canaanites didn’t view
prostitution as something bad.

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in order to be accepted

00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:45.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of Jehovah’s clean worshippers,

00:07:45.694 --> 00:07:49.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab had to abandon her immoral way of life.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:55.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise today, all who want
to please Jehovah must abandon

00:07:55.746 --> 00:08:00.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any lifestyles or conduct
that displeases him.

00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:03.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes sexual immorality,

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
idolatry, theft, drunkenness,

00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:10.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and customs that are not in harmony
with the Scriptures.

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab and her family certainly were grateful

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:19.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that her faithful actions
led to their salvation.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:24.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that wasn’t all that Jehovah
did to bless this woman of strong faith.

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:27.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also had the privilege
of becoming an ancestress

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:31.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:33.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, may all of us

00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imitate the faith of Rahab.

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may that faith move us to action

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to abandon immoral conduct
and false religious customs,

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:49.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take our stand for Jehovah
and his pure worship,

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:51.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue to grow in knowledge of God,

00:08:51.927 --> 00:08:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to draw closer to him
as our loving, heavenly Father.

00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:59.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we show faith like that of Rahab,

00:08:59.768 --> 00:09:04.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will enjoy
Jehovah’s favor and blessing forever.

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:09.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:09:09.277 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:16.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!—Hannah.”

00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium, we’ve been reminded

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah cherishes and empowers

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who serve him loyally.

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:13.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this concluding part of the symposium,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll focus on single brothers and sisters.

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s answer three questions:

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, how do we know
that married and single Christians

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>all</i>  have an honored place
in the congregation?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, how can we show
that we value and support 

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fellow believers who are not married?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, if you’re single,

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you be
a successful fighter for the faith?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin,
let’s briefly consider Jehovah’s view

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of married and single Christians.

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:52.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing we love
about our God is that Jehovah is not partial.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:55.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of a person’s
nationality or skin color,

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anyone who wishes can serve him acceptably.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s impartiality also means

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he does not favor
married or single Christians,

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one over the other.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, remaining single
or getting married is a personal choice.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And nowhere does the Bible
state that our value to Jehovah

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is linked to being either single or married.

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Matthew 19:12,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that some of his followers
would choose to remain single

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on account of the Kingdom.”

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then went on to say:

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:37.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the one who can
make room for it make room for it.”

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about that for a moment.

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a Christian, younger or older,

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chooses to remain single
for the sake of the Kingdom,

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus respect such a decision

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they appreciate the good motive
behind that personal choice.

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:59.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other Christians are unmarried
because of circumstances in life.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, some faithful Christians
in the congregation are too young to marry.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others have lost a mate
because of death or divorce.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul
maintained God’s impartial view

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:16.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both single and married Christians.

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus,
Paul did not teach that Christians

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should marry or that they
should remain single.

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In commenting on Paul’s
first inspired letter to the Corinthians,

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> back in 2012 said this:

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:33.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Really, both [marriage and singleness]

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can be described as gifts from God. 

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not view
[singleness] as a cause for shame or grief.”

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:46.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Singleness may bring
a Christian certain advantages.

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An unmarried Christian who is not
weighed down with family responsibilities

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have more time and energy

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to devote to God’s service
than a married Christian.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, single Christians
do not view themselves

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:03.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as better than married
Christians for this reason.

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:07.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible’s message
—Jehovah’s thinking—is clear, isn’t it?

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Married and single Christians

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all can have an honored
place in the congregation.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider our second question:

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we who are married

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:24.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show that we value
and support fellow believers

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are not married?

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:30.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible
with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice verse 25.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the context,
we notice that Paul is emphasizing

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the Christian congregation,
we need one another.

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We depend on one another.

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as we need all
the parts of our literal body

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our eyes, our hands, and our feet—

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:52.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all Christians, single and married,
are valued and needed.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we show that we appreciate
our single brothers and sisters?

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 25:

00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . so that there should be
no division in the body,”

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s the point,
“but its members should have

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mutual concern for one another.”

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:16.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study edition of the <i>New World</i>
<i>Translation </i> says that this expression,

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have mutual concern for one another,”

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could also be rendered
as “be anxious over one another.”

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:24.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson is clear:

00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Married Christians,

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:30.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we show appreciation
for single brothers and sisters

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we show concern for their welfare,

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether that’s spiritually or physically.

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not ignore them;
we don’t look down on them;

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:45.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor do we treat them as if we
have very little in common with them.

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard, the apostle Paul
set an example worthy of imitation.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:56.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was keenly interested
in Timothy’s spiritual health and progress.

00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:58.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though single,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul saw potential in Timothy
and invested in that spiritual man.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:05.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened as a result?

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:09.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An inexperienced, young, single Christian

00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:13.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became an excellent overseer.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the two of them, Paul and Timothy,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were no longer traveling together,

00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:21.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul continued to show
genuine interest in Timothy’s welfare.

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:24.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that because he wrote two letters

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:28.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has preserved
for our benefit in the Holy Scriptures.

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine
how Timothy must have felt

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:36.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have received a letter
from his older friend Paul?

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:40.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For just a moment,
let’s put ourselves in Timothy’s sandals

00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:45.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we listen to just a few lines
from Paul’s first letter.

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:50.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith:

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May you have undeserved kindness
and mercy and peace

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:57.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:01.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A little later in the letter,
Timothy would have read this:

00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:05.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This instruction I entrust to you,
my child Timothy,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in harmony with the prophecies
that were made about you,

00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:13.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that by these you may
go on waging the fine warfare.”

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there was this encouragement:

00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:18.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not neglect the gift in you

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was given you through a prophecy

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the body of elders
laid their hands on you.”

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:29.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think those
words of encouragement reassured Timothy

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:31.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made him feel appreciated?

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:33.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same letter,
Paul went on to express concern

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Timothy’s “frequent cases of sickness.”

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:42.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s concern for Timothy’s welfare,

00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:45.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his spiritual and physical welfare,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt touched
Timothy’s heart and encouraged him

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:51.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move forward in Jehovah’s service.

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul’s example touches our heart as well.

00:06:56.144 --> 00:06:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may be moved to ask ourselves:

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there more I can do

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:04.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to look out for the needs of single ones

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:07.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘who are exerting
themselves in God’s service?

00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:12.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I wrongly view single ones as incomplete,

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:15.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘inferior, or lacking,

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or do I show them honor?’

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:22.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a traveling overseer,
Timothy was a success.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:25.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul did not look down on him.

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:29.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Paul chose Timothy,
a single Christian,

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for weighty assignments
and gave him the training he needed

00:07:33.432 --> 00:07:35.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to succeed.

00:07:35.976 --> 00:07:40.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, I’m sure you
and I can think of many practical ways

00:07:40.397 --> 00:07:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can demonstrate
our concern for the welfare

00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:48.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our fellow believers who are unmarried.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The August 2020 issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:53.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided this reminder in a study article:

00:07:53.493 --> 00:07:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We do well to keep in mind

00:07:56.872 --> 00:08:01.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that some single Christians have made it
a personal goal to remain unmarried.

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:04.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Other . . . Christians would like to marry,

00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:07.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they simply
have not found the right person.

00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:11.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Still others may
have lost their mate in death.

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:14.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In any case,
should those in the congregation

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:18.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“feel the need to ask
single Christians why they are not married

00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:21.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to offer [help to] find a mate?”

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:27.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we reason on Jehovah’s thinking
as found in the Scriptures,

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:29.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know the answer to that question.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:33.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We <i>do not</i>  need to ask single ones
when they are getting married;

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor do we need to pair them up
with other single ones

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they have not requested our help.

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we should look for ways
to commend them

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:46.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their fine example and assure them

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:49.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we love and appreciate them.

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:52.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:56.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please note what an elder learned
about the challenges faced by single ones.

00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:02.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, it’s hard to believe
this is our last time together.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:08.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a packed agenda,
so let’s get started.

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:09.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first point . . .

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:12.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is our last week
with our circuit overseer

00:09:12.322 --> 00:09:14.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he leaves us
for his new circuit assignment.

00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:17.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick has been a great circuit overseer

00:09:17.077 --> 00:09:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spiritually mature, experienced,

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and patient with us.

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:23.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom, your thought?

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:24.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers and sisters . . .

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick is single.

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sadly, there were plenty of times

00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:32.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we turned that gift into a challenge

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:34.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ever since his first visit.

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:49.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Jeff.

00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:51.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I have a minute.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that.

00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:54.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laundry night.

00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:56.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My washing machine is a clunker.

00:09:56.867 --> 00:10:01.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just assumed a single brother
had lots of free time.

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:05.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know how much he had to do
on his own.

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a lot more I didn’t understand.

00:10:12.757 --> 00:10:13.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you. Bye!

00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:14.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, look!

00:10:19.848 --> 00:10:22.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have something there.

00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:24.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like a great Bible study.

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:26.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t wait to meet her.

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:27.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.
See you then.

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:28.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:31.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would be really good . . .

00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:35.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what you’re waiting for.

00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:37.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For what?

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:39.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on!

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A single circuit overseer, a pioneer sister

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:44.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you’ve got to be looking for a C.O.’s wife.

00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:49.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, . . .

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:51.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teasing was so inappropriate

00:10:51.588 --> 00:10:54.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was there at every visit.

00:10:57.844 --> 00:11:00.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there were those trying to be,

00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:03.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how should I say, <i>helpful.</i>

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:08.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!

00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:11.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to meet them,

00:11:11.983 --> 00:11:15.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I invited them for lunch Saturday.

00:11:15.862 --> 00:11:18.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick never asked for that help.

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:21.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All it did was put him

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:24.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and plenty of sisters
in an awkward situation.

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:28.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he dealt with week after week.

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:33.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all failed at times
to see past the single person

00:11:33.213 --> 00:11:36.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the spiritual man giving Jehovah his best.

00:11:37.634 --> 00:11:39.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll miss you.

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:42.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just maybe not as much
as some of the sisters.

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:46.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to make that mistake again

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:48.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with any single brother or sister.

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick.

00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:50.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeff.

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:51.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:52.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot from you.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I hope Jehovah blesses you
wherever you go.

00:11:56.152 --> 00:11:57.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!
Thanks, Rick.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now consider our final point:

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:06.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re single,

00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:11.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you too can be powerful by faith.

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:13.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how?

00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:15.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A great help in building faith

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:19.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by setting and reaching spiritual goals.

00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:22.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of Abraham, Romans 4:20 says:

00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:25.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of the promise of God,

00:12:25.432 --> 00:12:28.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not waver in a lack of faith.”

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:32.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Abraham, we encourage you
single brothers and sisters

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to frequently meditate on God’s promises.

00:12:36.026 --> 00:12:38.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking often about how Jehovah

00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:41.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has kept every promise to us in the past

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he’s keeping his promises now

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely encourages us to remember

00:12:46.786 --> 00:12:51.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will keep every promise
that he has made for our future.

00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:55.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so strengthens our faith.

00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:58.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, like Paul, like Timothy,

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:01.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk about Jehovah’s promises with others

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by zealously sharing in the field ministry.

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:09.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, please, do not isolate yourself

00:13:09.017 --> 00:13:11.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from others in the congregation,

00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:14.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that you have
very little to contribute.

00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:17.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you have much to contribute

00:13:17.692 --> 00:13:22.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a faithful brother or sister
in the Christian congregation.

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We warmly encourage you to reach out

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:27.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and associate with spiritually mature ones

00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:31.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your congregation,
whether single or married.

00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:35.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Timothy, “ponder over these things;

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:38.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be absorbed in [spiritual pursuits],

00:13:38.046 --> 00:13:43.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that your advancement
may be plainly [manifest to] all.”

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:47.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you are needed and loved.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what have all of us
learned in this faith-strengthening

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:54.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouraging symposium?

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:58.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible
with me to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:13:58.983 --> 00:14:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting in verse 4, you’ll notice,
as you scan the verses,

00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:08.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many familiar names of men
and women of faith are outlined for us.

00:14:08.076 --> 00:14:10.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s Abel and Enoch,

00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:12.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah, Abraham, Sarah,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab, Gideon, and David, and many more.

00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:20.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these men and women
had different circumstances in life.

00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:22.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true.

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:25.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did they all have in common?

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:28.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Hebrews 11:34.

00:14:28.847 --> 00:14:31.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the middle of the verse, it tells us

00:14:31.182 --> 00:14:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they “were made powerful.”

00:14:34.978 --> 00:14:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they “were made powerful” by faith.

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:42.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the same is happening today

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:47.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every congregation
of Jehovah’s people earth wide.

00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:51.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young ones, older ones, men and women

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:54.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—regardless of our family circumstances—

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:58.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us are being made powerful by faith.

00:14:58.126 --> 00:15:01.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:06.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please be assured that we love you
and appreciate you.

00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may Jehovah bless your efforts

00:15:09.012 --> 00:15:12.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a successful fighter for the faith.

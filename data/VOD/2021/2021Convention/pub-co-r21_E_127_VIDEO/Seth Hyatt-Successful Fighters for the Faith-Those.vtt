At Psalm 68:5,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is called
“a father of the fatherless.”

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:12.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a fatherless child?

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do you have a fatherless child

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or fatherless children in your congregation?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be wondering,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What do we mean by fatherless child?’

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the context of our discussion,

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:31.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re talking about young people

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have only one believing parent

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:37.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one parent in the truth.

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that allows
for a spectrum of possibilities:

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a single-parent family;

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could be a religiously divided family,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially when the unbeliever
is opposed;

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could even include a situation

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where only one parent
is actively serving Jehovah.

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:06.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was five years old when my mother
learned the truth from the Bible.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some years,
I lived in a religiously divided home.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And eventually,
my mother became a single parent,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we dealt with those circumstances.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many of us here at Bethel

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the field pioneering,

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as missionaries,
circuit overseers,

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
construction workers

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many of us who
have experienced similar circumstances.

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, in the Bible,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw fit to include
the life experience of a young man

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who grew up
in a religiously divided home

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Timothy.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes him as having

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘a believing Jewish mother

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a Greek father.’

00:01:56.261 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had only one parent who served Jehovah.

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that his mother, Eunice,

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his grandmother Lois

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:10.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were instrumental in helping him

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become well-founded in the truth.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Scriptures indicate
that others had a share

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his spiritual advancement as well.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where all of us
come into this conversation.

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us, like Jehovah,

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to appreciate the fatherless children

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:33.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our congregations.

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should view them as modern-day Timothys.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do that?

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can learn a lot
from the apostle Paul.

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Late in the year 49 or early 50 C.E.,

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:53.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul,
on his second missionary journey,

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visited the city of Lystra

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there he observed Timothy

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just in a casual way.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:07.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul really saw Timothy.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed his potential,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he took the initiative
to provide training

00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Timothy could realize that potential.

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a beautiful example for us.

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to take note of

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encourage

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fatherless children in our midst.

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul set a nice example

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:39.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in something that he wrote to Timothy.

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the year 65 C.E.,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was a prisoner in Rome

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no prospect of being released.

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, his death was imminent

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—time to write one more letter.

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To whom did he write?

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Timothy
—his beloved “child in the faith.”

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he have to say to Timothy

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this last inspired letter?

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together,
2 Timothy chapter 1,

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Timothy 1:5:

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:27.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I recall your unhypocritical faith,

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:31.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your mother Eunice,

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but which I am confident is also in you.”

00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what Paul did?

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a few words,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he commended and expressed confidence

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:51.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Timothy

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he also commended Timothy’s mother

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grandmother
—didn’t he?—

00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:59.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their “unhypocritical faith.”

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:04.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Lois and Eunice,
serving Jehovah was not playacting.

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith was genuine.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:11.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing for Timothy
that proved to be!

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:16.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can offer

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
specific, sincere, heartfelt commendation

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:25.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fatherless children

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:28.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their parents

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:32.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and commend them
for what they’re able to do.

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:37.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Include them
in spiritual and recreational activities.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a boy,

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my grandmother used to pick me up
every Saturday morning

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:46.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take me in the ministry.

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had to wonder if she was coming,

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:51.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I never had to wonder
who I would work with.

00:05:51.997 --> 00:05:55.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book study conductor, an older brother,

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:59.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would always include my grandmother and me

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the group with him and his wife.

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cherish those memories.

00:06:05.928 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay close attention now

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as some who grew up
in single-parent homes

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:14.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explain how they were encouraged

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:17.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be successful fighters for the faith.

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:24.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like a bad dream.

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:28.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family was really zealous in the truth.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were playing downstairs one day,

00:06:31.453 --> 00:06:33.080 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Mom came down to tell us

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she was leaving Jehovah and leaving Dad.

00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:39.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying goodbye to Mom,
that was the hardest day of my life.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.631 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My mother and father became inactive

00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:44.841 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when I was about four years old.

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.552 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My father was never really around.

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:50.430 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When my mom started to learn the truth,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my dad said she was forbidden from studying.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were to go to the meetings,
he would take us out forcibly.

00:06:57.354 --> 00:07:00.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became verbally and physically abusive
to my mom.

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents’ breakup was very tough.

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:08.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle for my mother
to raise two boys on her own.

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would work two or three jobs,

00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:13.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serving Jehovah just took a backseat.

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:17.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my parents divorced,
my mom was very depressed.

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:19.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did the best she could,

00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:23.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah didn’t intend for mothers
to fill both roles

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as parents.

00:07:26.383 --> 00:07:27.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sisters and I,
we made a conscious choice

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:31.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we weren’t going to make
the same bad choices that Mom did.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that it was up to us.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:36.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:39.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was baptized when I was 15.

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:44.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thrived spiritually
when we didn’t have the opposition from Dad.

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:48.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we could go out in service,
go to the meetings freely.

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:51.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have to hide our literature
for fear he would rip them up.

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:54.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was around 15 years old,

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother took us to the meeting,

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was determined
that this was going to be her last meeting.

00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the night of a local needs part.

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:04.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the right time.

00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:08.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah just opened my mother’s heart wide.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that experience,

00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:12.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was like she was a new woman.

00:08:13.638 --> 00:08:15.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sisters and I have always been a team.

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:18.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pioneered together; we moved to Cambodia

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as need-greaters together.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re both in special full-time service

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:24.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their husbands in Cambodia,

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been serving here in Myanmar Bethel,
along with my husband,

00:08:27.903 --> 00:08:29.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for just over 11 years now.

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:33.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom set a stellar example
for me to follow.

00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:36.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her relationship with Jehovah
was always above everything else.

00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:39.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was her example that helped me

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set and reach spiritual goals.

00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:45.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering
during my senior year of high school.

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:48.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In nearly 20 years of full-time service,

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:52.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve spent most of that time
at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:57.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother had a very strong influence
on my theocratic goals.

00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:02.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I had the privilege of attending
the first School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:06.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and currently we’re serving
in the circuit work.

00:09:07.484 --> 00:09:10.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one needs to be defined
by their negative circumstances.

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:12.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:10 says:

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘God himself will complete your training.’

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:19.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be tough at times,
but with Jehovah’s help, you can succeed.

00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of what David said
in the 27th Psalm and verse 10;

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:28.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “Even if my . . . father [or] mother
abandon me,

00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:30.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah . . . will take me in.”

00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was definitely the case

00:09:33.343 --> 00:09:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my situation.

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:38.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t define us
by our upbringing or our past.

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:40.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our potential.

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:41.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s up to us.

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:45.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah,
we can be anything we want to be.

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:51.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we appreciate
those beautiful expressions.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:57.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those of you who are fatherless children,

00:09:57.159 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you see yourself?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see yourself as Jehovah sees you,

00:10:03.832 --> 00:10:08.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a unique individual with potential?

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:13.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, you’re not inferior in any way
because of your circumstances.

00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:17.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you appreciate the comments
made by those in the video?

00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:22.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your circumstances don’t have to define you.

00:10:22.517 --> 00:10:27.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Negative circumstances and upbringing
do not have to define you.

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:29.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would add this:

00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:34.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your unique experience in life
gives you a unique perspective,

00:10:34.362 --> 00:10:38.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah may be able
to use you to help others.

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:42.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be a Timothy.

00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:45.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a young age, relatively speaking,

00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:49.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was a spiritual man
and entrusted with responsibility.

00:10:49.586 --> 00:10:51.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul described him

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:55.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as having a disposition like no one else’s.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy cared for others.

00:10:58.386 --> 00:11:00.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do the same.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reach out!

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:04.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be a pioneer, a Bethelite,

00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:08.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a field missionary, a construction worker,

00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a circuit overseer.

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:13.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You young brothers,
qualify and reach out

00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:18.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a ministerial servant
and then an elder.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opportunities are endless.

00:11:21.284 --> 00:11:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow Jehovah to use you,

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:30.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue to cultivate appreciation

00:11:30.252 --> 00:11:32.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your loyal parent.

00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:35.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I appreciate my mother very much

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:37.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her fine example of faith

00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:41.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through a number
of very trying circumstances.

00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:46.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t take the faithfulness
of our single parents

00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:48.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for granted.

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:50.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in conclusion,

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:52.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to assure you

00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:57.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can be
a successful fighter for the faith,

00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:00.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Timothy was.

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:02.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have confidence in you,

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:06.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray Jehovah’s continued rich blessing

00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:08.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your service to him.

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:22.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith
—Single Christians.”

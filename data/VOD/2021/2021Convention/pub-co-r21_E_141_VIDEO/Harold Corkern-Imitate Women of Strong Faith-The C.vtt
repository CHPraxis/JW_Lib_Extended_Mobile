In the 11th century B.C.E.,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the nation of Syria
would often attack Israel,

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capturing many and making many their slaves

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:12.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even children.

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the Bible describes
one of these raids

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Kings chapter 5.

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Kings chapter 5, and in verse 1,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are told that Naaman
was the army chief of the Syrians.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a mighty warrior,
but he was also very sick with leprosy.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verse 2:

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On one of their raids,

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Syrians had taken captive
from the land of Israel

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little girl who became
a servant to Naaman’s wife.”

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you picture this little girl
being ripped away from her parents?

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:48.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was frightening for her.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was taken to a strange land
with people that were intimidating,

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they worshipped many false gods.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that very difficult circumstance,

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how was this little girl
required to exercise strong faith?

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note the answer to this question
in the following video.

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember the day the soldiers took me away.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never felt more alone.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My home, my friends,

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything I knew was gone.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I still had Jehovah.

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The master of the house was very sick.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in pain.

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha could help him.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard about Elisha’s miracles.

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had even raised the dead.

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Elisha could cure him,

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave me the courage to speak up.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite being away from her parents,

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:02.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this little girl exercised strong faith.

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did she get that faith?

00:02:04.603 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt her parents had inculcated

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love and trust for Jehovah in her.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she also had things

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were happening in her lifetime
that would build her faith.

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would have known
about the miracles of the prophet Elisha

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how, with Jehovah’s spirit,
he performed many miracles,

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including raising a little boy from the dead.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This little girl could have reasoned,

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why, if Jehovah
can raise a little boy from death,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can certainly cure
my master from his disease.’

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did she do
with this faith and trust?

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She spoke up courageously.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:48.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice her words to her mistress

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at 2 Kings 5:3:

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She said to her mistress:

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If only my lord would visit
the prophet in Samaria!

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he would cure him of his leprosy.’”

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such boldness!

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because she spoke up,
Naaman went to Israel,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got in touch with Elisha the prophet,

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humbled himself,
listened to the instructions,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was completely cured of the leprosy.

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else very important occurred.

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of Naaman’s coming
to know about Jehovah,

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:28.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did he declare?

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Kings 5:15, he said:

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that there is no God
anywhere in all the earth but in Israel.”

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Naaman also vowed

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would never serve
any other god but Jehovah.

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy Naaman and his entire household
was when he went home!

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only was he cured of his leprosy

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now he was
a happy, joyful servant of Jehovah.

00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:58.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s not just in Bible times

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that good experiences
like this have occurred.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:08.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how one of our sisters
showed strong faith,

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under the most difficult
of circumstances.

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken from my home,

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:22.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband,

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my spiritual family.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:30.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was imprisoned for my faith.

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was another world.

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:43.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy staying strong.

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I asked for a Bible,
the answer was no.

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s Word was already in my heart.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I did what I love the most;

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked about God’s Kingdom.

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:22.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of those I preached to
seemed cold at first,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but genuine love and the warmth of God’s Word

00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:29.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just seemed to melt their hearts.

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes speaking up
took more courage than I thought I had,

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:40.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not more courage
than Jehovah could give me.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:58.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to look
beyond the locks and uniforms.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s will is that “all sorts of people”
learn about him.

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:08.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I spoke about my God, Jehovah.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that even behind prison bars,

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:46.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would give me the strength

00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:50.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others.

00:06:56.228 --> 00:07:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, we’d like to address
our young ones in the audience.

00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:05.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too can have strong faith
like the little Israelite girl

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell others about Jehovah.

00:07:08.323 --> 00:07:12.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the words of Romans 10:13, 14.

00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:17.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is so important
that people know about Jehovah.

00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:20.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can they know about him
and gain salvation

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there’s no one to preach?

00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:26.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too can become a bold
and faithful preacher of the good news.

00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:28.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By taking in Bible truths
and building up strong faith in your heart,

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:37.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you’ll be able to do
like our sister did in the dramatization.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what she said?

00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:41.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I had God’s Word in my heart.

00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:44.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And as a result, even in prison

00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:47.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when I was surrounded
by all those difficulties,

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I did what I love to do;

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked about God’s Kingdom.’

00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:57.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another thing you can do
is pray for more courage and faith.

00:07:57.456 --> 00:07:59.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what our sister said?

00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:04.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It seemed that, at times,
to speak up required more courage than I had,

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:07.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not more courage
than Jehovah could give me.’

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:14.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So dear young ones,
don’t be afraid to talk about Jehovah

00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:17.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the truth to your schoolmates,

00:08:17.517 --> 00:08:21.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your unbelieving relatives,
to your teachers.

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:22.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good results will happen.

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:27.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, there is an experience
of a schoolteacher here in the United States

00:08:27.903 --> 00:08:30.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been searching
for the basic questions

00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:33.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to the meaning of life,
but she could not find them.

00:08:33.575 --> 00:08:36.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then a 12-year-old student at school

00:08:36.453 --> 00:08:38.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked this teacher three questions.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first question:

00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know
that I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?”

00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:43.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes.”

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to learn more
about Jehovah’s Witnesses?”

00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:48.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes.”

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:51.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third question:
“Where do you live?”

00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our 12-year-old sister
started a study with her teacher.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:57.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher loved what she was hearing,

00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:02.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made excellent progress, and was baptized.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sister, the former schoolteacher,

00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:07.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been serving Jehovah now
for many decades.

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:10.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, for the last 40 years,

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:14.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she has been serving as a member
of the United States Bethel family.

00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So blessings come
when we speak up and show strong faith.

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:22.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
in the case of the little Israelite girl,

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:26.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naaman would have never gone to Israel
if she had not spoken up.

00:09:26.878 --> 00:09:29.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result, he was cured,

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:32.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also became a servant of Jehovah.

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:35.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in harmony with the strong faith

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that captive Israelite girl,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

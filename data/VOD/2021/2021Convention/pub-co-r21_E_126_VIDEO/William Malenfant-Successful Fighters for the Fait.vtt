Jehovah God’s inspired Word

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes this significant declaration

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Titus 2:11.

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:19.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the undeserved kindness of God
has been manifested,

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“bringing salvation

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all sorts of people.”

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, “to all sorts of people”

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this was true in the first century,

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s true today more than ever before.

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are a worldwide brotherhood
made up of “all sorts of people”

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have come to a knowledge of the truth,

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have made the decision
to serve Jehovah.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will discuss three sorts of people:

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, those whose mates

00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not yet Jehovah’s Witnesses;

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, those who are being raised

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by one believing parent or relative;

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and third, those who are single.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:16.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters
who find themselves in these situations

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are successfully putting up
“a hard fight for the faith,”

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated in Jude 3.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of them are valuable assets
to the congregation.

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we discuss each situation

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this symposium,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:39.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please focus your attention
on those who are in the congregation

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you attend

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask yourself,

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I show my appreciation
for brothers and sisters

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have these circumstances?’

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And ask yourself,

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:58.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I am in one of the situations
being discussed,

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘what will help me to continue

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fight successfully for the faith?’

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This talk will focus

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Christians with unbelieving mates.

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a well-known example,
we look back to the first century

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a woman named Eunice,
the mother of Timothy.

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is referred to at Acts 16:1,

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Timothy was
“the son of a believing Jewish woman

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of a Greek father.”

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it refers to Eunice as a believing woman,

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:40.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it does not refer to Timothy’s father
as a believing man.

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:45.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is that Timothy’s father
was not a Christian.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, Eunice, his mother,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with Lois, his grandmother,

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught Timothy the holy writings

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the truth as found in God’s Word.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we speak of unbelieving mates,

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we recognize that their circumstances

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:07.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not all the same.

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:12.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some non-Witness mates oppose true worship.

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others are indifferent.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And others may be tolerant,

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even somewhat interested and supportive,

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they may not be progressing
toward baptism.

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some mates of believers are baptized,

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they have weakened spiritually.

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:36.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may no longer be regular at meetings,
go in service,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or participate in family worship.

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And last of all, sad to say,

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some mates are disfellowshipped.

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we never give up on unbelieving mates,

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we always hope
that any who are disfellowshipped

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come to their senses, repent,
and return to Jehovah.

00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:07.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there something that we as publishers
in the congregation can do

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show appreciation for fellow believers

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:13.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose mates are not yet serving Jehovah?

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there is,

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:17.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the apostle Paul tells us

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:21.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 3:17

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can learn from their good example

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:27.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imitate them.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:32.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 3:17 says:

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers,

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and keep your eye on those
who are walking in a way

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:46.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in harmony
with the example we set for you.”

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul tells us
to look closely at his example

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fine example of others
in the congregation.

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:58.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among those setting a fine example

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:02.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are brothers and sisters
who have unbelieving mates.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:07.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have worked hard to maintain
a strong relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:11.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have cultivated self-discipline
to keep a good schedule

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:13.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of theocratic activities.

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many have become proficient in balancing

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:21.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
family obligations with spiritual pursuits.

00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy, but they are doing it.

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:31.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how should we view them and treat them?

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:37.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do what Philippians 2:4 tells us to do.

00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:41.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We “look out
not only for [our] own interests,

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:49.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that we show concern
for their well-being.

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We treat them with respect.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly do not ignore them.

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:58.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We recognize that as spiritual people,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have much to offer.

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:05.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it wonderful that we are family

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we belong to one another?

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:13.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We take brothers and sisters who have
unbelieving mates into account,

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:17.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look out for their interests
as the scripture states

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:19.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we love them

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:23.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see their good qualities.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do?

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever possible,

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should include them in our activities.

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:36.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what else can we do?

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:39.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can show interest in their mates

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:43.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try to help them spiritually.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:46.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if circumstances allow,

00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:48.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invite them with their mates

00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:51.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a meal or to a gathering.

00:06:51.932 --> 00:06:55.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that friendliness
and upbuilding conversation

00:06:55.477 --> 00:06:59.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have a powerful effect
on a person’s heart.

00:06:59.648 --> 00:07:02.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:06.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about how you can show appreciation

00:07:06.154 --> 00:07:08.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for any in your congregation

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose mates
are not presently serving Jehovah.

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:18.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was when my husband was really opposed.

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:22.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night, he put a knife to his stomach

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said,
“Will you choose me or the truth?”

00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:32.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband was cooperative.

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:33.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would wave goodbye

00:07:33.515 --> 00:07:36.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we went to the meetings,

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:40.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he wasn’t interested at all.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt really jealous

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:47.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I saw families
sitting together at assemblies.

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of work

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:53.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking care of his mother,

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:56.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband gradually started missing
meetings.

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:59.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in our congregation,
with good intentions,

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pointed it out to him.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way they did this

00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:06.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made him feel misunderstood

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:07.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discouraged,

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he put the Bible
and the publications away.

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:15.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had times when I wanted

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:17.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to drift away with him.

00:08:19.227 --> 00:08:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really happy when I learned the truth.

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:27.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my zeal, I bombarded my husband
with information,

00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:31.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that made him worry
that I had turned into a fanatic.

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:35.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he was genuinely concerned
for his family

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thought that I had joined
a weird religion.

00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:42.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One family in the congregation

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often invited us to meals

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and outdoor activities.

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:48.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think my husband appreciated

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those small acts of kindness.

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:54.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also tried to show that I appreciated him

through my speech and conduct.

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my children and I applied

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:02.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we learned in our lives,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he gradually became interested
in the truth.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words “safeguard your heart”

00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caught my eye.

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:15.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to try and keep my heart

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:17.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my children’s hearts

00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:20.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward Jehovah.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.541 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I went out in the ministry

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:23.875 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with my children,

00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:26.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would point out various aspects

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:28.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s creation around us.

00:09:28.922 --> 00:09:30.924 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And before my husband

00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:33.468 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would come home from work,

00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:36.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made it a habit to teach them God’s Word.

00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:38.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a conscious effort

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see myself in Paradise with my husband.

00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:45.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strengthened my resolve

00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:48.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never leave the truth.

00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote caring notes to my husband

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:53.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I went to the meetings.

00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:57.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced
that he would come back one day,

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:01.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did come back.

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:04.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not leave Jehovah,

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:07.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:10:08.503 --> 00:10:12.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband never embraced the truth.

00:10:12.132 --> 00:10:15.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, right now all five

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of my children are in the truth,

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:21.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I feel really blessed.

00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:24.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being able to serve Jehovah as a family

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with my husband

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the joy and appreciation

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just keep welling up.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we learn from the video?

00:10:38.617 --> 00:10:43.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that believing mates
who display fine Christian qualities

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have a positive influence on mates

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:49.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are not yet serving Jehovah.

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:51.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will help you

00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:53.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on fighting for the faith?

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:57.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wisdom and strength

00:10:57.135 --> 00:11:00.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only Jehovah can provide.

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:04.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, his power is unlimited

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:07.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he finds pleasure in showing favor

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:09.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who trust in him.

00:11:10.607 --> 00:11:13.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you know that he loves you

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:16.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he listens to sincere prayers

00:11:16.154 --> 00:11:19.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who want to do things his way.

00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The combination of God’s love,
prayer, and his spirit

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:29.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can give you the strength
and the wisdom you need

00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:33.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain a balanced routine
of spiritual activities

00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:38.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while making sure to care
for your family responsibilities.

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:44.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video, the believing mates
took advantage

00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all the spiritual food that was available

00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:49.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build themselves up.

00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:51.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah helped them to display

00:11:51.898 --> 00:11:56.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spiritual qualities of patience and tact.

00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know as well as I do that at times

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may not be as tactful as we should be.

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:07.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being patient and tactful is not always easy,

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:10.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you’re tired

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel disappointed
by your mate’s words or actions.

00:12:15.463 --> 00:12:19.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, regardless of your situation,

00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:22.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can supply you with the power

00:12:22.637 --> 00:12:25.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep setting a fine example

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:27.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you keep on praying

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:31.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your mate will eventually respond
to the truth.

00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Peter 3:1, 2

00:12:38.194 --> 00:12:42.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 3:1, 2—

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:47.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find this very wise and practical counsel.

00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:51.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:1, 2 reads:

00:12:51.082 --> 00:12:53.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the same way,

00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:57.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you wives, be in subjection
to your husbands,

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:01.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that if any are not obedient to the word,

00:13:01.217 --> 00:13:04.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they may be won without a word

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the conduct of their wives,

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:10.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of having been eyewitnesses

00:13:10.435 --> 00:13:12.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of your chaste conduct

00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together with deep respect.”

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:23.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The counsel that Peter gives
is tested and true.

00:13:23.448 --> 00:13:25.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its application has helped

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an untold number of unbelieving mates

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept the truth.

00:13:31.206 --> 00:13:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think about it,
it is truly amazing

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:38.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how deep respect and fine conduct

00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:41.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can win over an unbelieving mate

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:44.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without a word being spoken.

00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:48.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, as you work
what is good toward your mate,

00:13:48.723 --> 00:13:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there undoubtedly will be opportunities
to speak about the truth

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:55.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provide spiritual assistance

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when circumstances permit
and it seems appropriate.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep on setting a fine example

00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:08.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying that your mate
will respond to the truth.

00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have faith in the inspired words
that Paul wrote

00:14:12.288 --> 00:14:17.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 7:16

00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:20.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 7:16—

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:24.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remember to continue to show

00:14:24.008 --> 00:14:27.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a positive attitude toward your mate.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:32.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 7:16 poses two questions

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with a positive slant.

00:14:34.978 --> 00:14:38.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 7 and verse 16 reads:

00:14:38.273 --> 00:14:41.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For wife, how do you know

00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:43.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether you will save your husband?

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or, husband, how do you know

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:49.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether you will save your wife?”

00:14:49.784 --> 00:14:53.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this text is telling us
to remain positive

00:14:53.747 --> 00:14:58.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the possibility
of a mate taking the truth.

00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:00.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is a fact

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:04.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many unbelieving mates
have accepted the truth

00:15:04.007 --> 00:15:07.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of observing a husband or a wife

00:15:07.427 --> 00:15:10.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who follows God’s direction.

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:14.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we continue to hope wholeheartedly

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:19.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in time unbelieving mates
will respond to the truth

00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:23.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find pleasure in serving Jehovah.

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:28.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you apply divine counsel from God’s Word,

00:15:28.573 --> 00:15:31.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be assured that with Jehovah’s help,

00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:36.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can continue to be
a successful fighter for the faith

and bring honor to Jehovah God.

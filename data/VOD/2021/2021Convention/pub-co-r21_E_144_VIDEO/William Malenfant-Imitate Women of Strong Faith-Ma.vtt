“Martha, Martha”

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she was a hard-working, hospitable woman.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that “Jesus loved Martha

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her sister [Mary]
and [their brother] Lazarus.”

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Lazarus took ill,

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha surely did everything
in her power to soothe his discomfort.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:28.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was so concerned
with her brother’s condition

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she and her sister,
Mary, sent a message to Jesus,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 11:3, saying:

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lord, see!

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one for whom you have affection is sick.”

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:48.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha knew that Lazarus was seriously ill.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She must have felt helpless

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Lazarus sank deeper
into his illness and then died.

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Martha do?

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would she give in to despair,

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would grief overpower her
and weaken her faith?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to imagine Martha’s grief
when her brother died.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those first few days,

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was a blur.

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sister, Mary, and I
had never felt so empty and lost.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that if our Lord had been here,

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brother would not have died.

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through the tears and the pain,

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no doubt
that the resurrection was real,

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:42.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someday

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—someday—
he would live again.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who could have imagined

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could happen that very day

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:52.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right before our eyes?

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wept tears of joy

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:59.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thanked
our loving Father in heaven, Jehovah.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy helps us to feel the pain

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the distress that Martha
felt when Lazarus died.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible account tells us that Jesus
traveled to Bethany, where Martha lived,

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did not arrive before Lazarus died.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he came four days
after Lazarus had died.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus met with Martha,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she expressed faith that Jesus
could have healed Lazarus,

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:36.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she felt that Jesus
might yet help her brother.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures show that she also believed

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the future resurrection.

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:49.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha must have been thinking
about miracles that Jesus had performed

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the people who had been healed by him.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she had no doubt

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was the Christ
and that he could perform miracles.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me what the Bible says

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Martha’s faith in the resurrection

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:09.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her confidence in Jesus.

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found at John 11:21-26.

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads as follows:

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Martha then said to Jesus:

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Lord, if you had been here,

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my brother would not have died.’”

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t say this to reproach Jesus;
she merely stated a fact.

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she goes on.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says: “‘Yet even now

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:39.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I know that whatever you ask God for,

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God will give you.’

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to her:

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Your brother will rise.’

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Martha said to him:

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I know he will rise
in the resurrection on the last day.’

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to her:

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:59.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am the resurrection and the life.

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The one who exercises faith in me,

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘even though he dies, will come to life;

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and everyone who is living
and exercises faith in me

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will never die at all.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:14.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you believe this?’”

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 27,

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha makes
one of the most important statements

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:23.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would ever pass her lips.

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:26.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads: “She said to him,

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:31.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes, Lord, I have believed
that you are the Christ,

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of God,
the one coming into the world.’”

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:43.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much her faith was appreciated by Jesus.

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:48.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus Christ has the same appreciation for us

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we show our faith in his promises.

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:59.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe how a sister’s faith
brings her comfort.

00:05:36.273 --> 00:05:38.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I lost my son,

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:42.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost part of myself.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to stay busy,

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:58.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything felt empty.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my darkest times,

00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:31.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a day goes by
that I don’t think about Brandon

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:14.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just memories of how it was

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:20.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even more how wonderful it’ll be
to see him soon

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s new world.

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:32.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We deeply sympathize
with the sister in the video

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:34.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the loss of her son

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with any in the congregation

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:40.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have suffered the loss of a loved one.

00:07:40.188 --> 00:07:44.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you take note
of how the sister imitated Martha’s faith

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by putting her complete trust in Jehovah God

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and going to him in prayer?

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:57.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Martha,
we can build our faith in the resurrection

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:02.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by carefully considering
all that God’s Word says about it.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of all the evidence there is

00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was resurrected.

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures show clearly
that after his death and resurrection,

00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:18.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus “showed himself alive”
to his disciples.

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also appeared to Saul of Tarsus,
who became the apostle Paul.

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:27.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his letter to the Corinthians,

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:31.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul points out that “more than 500 brothers”

00:08:31.198 --> 00:08:34.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saw the resurrected Jesus.

00:08:34.242 --> 00:08:38.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to show that it was not just hearsay,

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:43.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul tells us that most
of those eyewitnesses were still alive

00:08:43.043 --> 00:08:46.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wrote to the Corinthians.

00:08:46.004 --> 00:08:51.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were living witnesses
who could verify the fact

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:54.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was resurrected from the dead.

00:08:55.764 --> 00:09:00.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about the inspired
assurance that we have

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Revelation 21:3, 4

00:09:03.647 --> 00:09:05.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that the time is coming

00:09:05.982 --> 00:09:08.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when “death will be no more.”

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:11.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think about it,

00:09:11.905 --> 00:09:15.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is it that declares
that “death will be no more”

00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Revelation 21:3, 4?

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None other than the resurrected Jesus Christ.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do well to imitate Martha

00:09:26.128 --> 00:09:28.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by maintaining strong faith

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:31.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we face the loss of a loved one.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:36.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s not easy; it’s painful.

00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can do it,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing full well
that this life is not all there is.

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:46.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All true Christians

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have faith in the resurrection

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—faith that the dead will live again

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:57.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that death
will be done away with in God’s new world.

00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:03.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and his Son
rewarded the faith of Martha,

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:06.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary, and Lazarus.

00:10:06.418 --> 00:10:08.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be rewarded too

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:13.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we build strong faith like that of Martha.

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:19.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:23.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

00:10:23.268 --> 00:10:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!

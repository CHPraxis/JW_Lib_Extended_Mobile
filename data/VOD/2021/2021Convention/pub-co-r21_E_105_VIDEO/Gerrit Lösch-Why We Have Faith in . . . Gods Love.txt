00:00:01 Many people believe in God.
00:00:03 In what sense?
00:00:05 They believe that there must exist a God, a Creator.
00:00:10 Sheer logic causes them to believe this.
00:00:13 Why?
00:00:15 Because of being aware that there is creation.
00:00:19 If the Creator would not exist,
00:00:22 no creation would exist.
00:00:24 Why?
00:00:25 Because nothing comes from nothing.
00:00:30 This is also why we know that God has always existed.
00:00:35 If there would have been a time when he did not exist,
00:00:39 then nothing would exist today.
00:00:43 The fact that creation exists
00:00:45 proves there must be a Creator.
00:00:50 It also shows that God exists from all eternity,
00:00:54 although with our imperfect human mind
00:00:56 we have a hard time grasping this.
00:01:01 We are the product of his creation.
00:01:04 But is it enough to believe in him as the Creator
00:01:09 because without a Creator there could be no creation?
00:01:13 No.
00:01:15 Is it enough for a child to believe he has a father
00:01:19 because without a father he would not exist?
00:01:22 No.
00:01:24 A child should love his father;
00:01:27 a father normally loves and cares for his children.
00:01:32 The Creator, our Father,
00:01:34 not only cares about his creation,
00:01:37 but he also loves us
00:01:39 and cares for us as individuals.
00:01:44 He cares about you.
00:01:47 Jehovah God loves you.
00:01:50 Do you love him?
00:01:53 Are you a lover of God?
00:01:57 This is not automatic.
00:01:59 The apostle Paul says at 2 Timothy 3:4
00:02:04 that most people in this time of the end would be
00:02:08 “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”
00:02:14 Sometimes we may have feelings of worthlessness,
00:02:17 and such feelings could dampen our zeal in serving Jehovah,
00:02:22 could dampen our love, or even could cause us
00:02:25 to stop serving him.
00:02:28 Therefore, we need to build up and deepen
00:02:32 our love and trust in Jehovah.
00:02:37 Jehovah loves mankind.
00:02:40 What evidence is there for that?
00:02:43 We see Jehovah’s love in nature.
00:02:46 He created numerous trees, plants, and flowers
00:02:50 so that we can enjoy them.
00:02:53 He created for us not only things that we need to keep living
00:02:58 but things that impress our hearts
00:03:01 with awe and love for God,
00:03:04 the Giver of “every good gift.”
00:03:09 Man is not able to create one single animal
00:03:12 or even a fruit or flower.
00:03:15 The things God created help us to live
00:03:18 and enjoy living for as long as we do.
00:03:22 But Jehovah loves mankind so much
00:03:26 that he gave his firstborn spirit Son,
00:03:29 whom we came to know as Jesus Christ,
00:03:31 as a ransom for the sins of us imperfect humans
00:03:36 (for those who love him)
00:03:38 so they may live and enjoy
00:03:41 God’s love forever.
00:03:46 Although the first humans rebelled against Jehovah God,
00:03:50 Jehovah knew that there would be many others
00:03:53 who would choose to serve him out of love.
00:03:58 Please turn with me to John chapter 6.
00:04:04 Your listening in to this program is proof
00:04:07 not only of your love for Jehovah God and Jesus
00:04:11 but also of their love
00:04:15 for you as an individual.
00:04:18 At John 6:44, Jesus said:
00:04:25 “No man can come to me
00:04:27 unless the Father, who sent me, draws him.”
00:04:35 The Scriptures show that Jehovah has given humans free will.
00:04:40 Everyone has a choice
00:04:42 when it comes to serving him.
00:04:45 God gently draws to himself
00:04:48 those who have a heart that is “rightly disposed.”
00:04:53 Jehovah does so through the Bible’s message
00:04:56 and through his holy spirit.
00:04:59 How does Jehovah draw us?
00:05:02 The Greek verb rendered “draw”
00:05:05 is used in reference to hauling in a net of fishes.
00:05:10 Does Jehovah drag us against our will,
00:05:13 forcing us to serve him?
00:05:15 No.
00:05:16 Jehovah gave us free will,
00:05:19 so he does not force our heart open.
00:05:23 One scholar puts it this way:
00:05:26 “There is no handle on the outside of the door of the human heart.
00:05:31 It must be opened from within.”
00:05:35 Jehovah searches through the billions of hearts in this world,
00:05:40 looking for individuals who are inclined toward him.
00:05:46 When he finds such a person, he responds in a touching way.
00:05:51 Are you such a person?
00:05:54 We trust you are.
00:05:57 Jehovah gently attracts, or tugs,
00:06:00 at the hearts of ones who are “rightly disposed.”
00:06:06 Jehovah does so in two ways
00:06:09 —through the Bible’s message of good news
00:06:11 and through his holy spirit.
00:06:15 When Jehovah sees a heart that is responsive to Bible truth,
00:06:19 he uses his spirit to help the individual
00:06:22 to grasp and apply that truth in his life.
00:06:27 Without divine help,
00:06:29 we could never become genuine followers of Jesus
00:06:33 and devoted worshippers of Jehovah.
00:06:37 Jehovah draws people because he sees something good in their heart
00:06:41 and cares about them as individuals.
00:06:45 Does knowing that Jehovah cares about his worshippers as individuals
00:06:50 move you to want to open that door of your heart
00:06:54 and open it wide?
00:06:57 As you watch the following video,
00:06:59 notice how a brother named Carlos
00:07:02 came to appreciate that Jehovah is the loving Father
00:07:06 whom he had always yearned for.
00:07:13 When I went through difficult times during my childhood,
00:07:18 Jehovah was like my Father.
00:07:22 He was my refuge.
00:07:28 The first memory I have of my dad
00:07:31 is when I went to visit him
00:07:34 in the prison where he was being held.
00:07:42 I asked Jehovah so many times for my dad to come back home.
00:07:47 One day,
00:07:48 my mom said, “Dad’s coming home today.”
00:07:51 I went to school, and when I came back, he was there.
00:07:55 I thought that he was finally back for good and that it would be forever.
00:08:05 But soon after that, I heard my mom and my grandmother crying,
00:08:09 and they started to explain that my dad was back in prison.
00:08:16 From then on, I felt hatred, resentment, and anger toward my dad
00:08:21 and also toward Jehovah.
00:08:29 I started to take drugs
00:08:32 and to lead an immoral and violent lifestyle.
00:08:41 One day, a couple of sisters gave me a magazine.
00:08:44 As I was looking through it,
00:08:46 I saw the experience about Dustin.
00:08:51 I began to think about the times
00:08:53 during my childhood
00:08:55 when I would take refuge in Jehovah
00:08:57 and would feel the same way Dustin did.
00:08:58 I would say: “Jehovah is there.
00:09:00 He hasn’t abandoned me.”
00:09:03 Dustin never doubted Jehovah’s love,
00:09:06 right up until the day he died.
00:09:10 That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.
00:09:14 I asked him to forgive me because,
00:09:17 well,
00:09:19 it wasn’t his fault.
00:09:24 That night I poured out all my feelings to Jehovah.
00:09:28 That burden that I felt was finally gone.
00:09:38 I felt Jehovah’s love every step of the way.
00:09:42 He showed it through the brothers who didn’t judge me for what I had done.
00:09:54 It doesn’t matter how many problems we have
00:09:56 or how far we’ve drifted away from Jehovah.
00:10:01 He never abandons us.
00:10:12 Jehovah has lovingly helped many brothers and sisters
00:10:16 because of his love for them.
00:10:18 This can reassure you that Jehovah will help you as well
00:10:23 because Jehovah loves you too.
00:10:28 Did you notice how Jehovah demonstrated his love for Carlos?
00:10:33 Through his worshippers, Jehovah lovingly cared for this young man.
00:10:38 Please turn with me to Psalm 119.
00:10:43 Jehovah had not forgotten Carlos,
00:10:46 even though he had strayed for a time.
00:10:49 This reminds us of the words
00:10:51 at Psalm 119:176:
00:10:57 “I have strayed like a lost sheep.
00:11:00 “Search for your servant,
00:11:02 for I have not forgotten your commandments.”
00:11:07 There are indications that Psalm 119
00:11:11 may have been written by young Prince Hezekiah.
00:11:15 Hezekiah poured out his heart to Jehovah,
00:11:18 and Jehovah responded.
00:11:21 Brothers and sisters, please pour out your hearts to Jehovah,
00:11:25 and take note of how he will answer your prayers.
00:11:31 Please turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3.
00:11:36 Jehovah can and will
00:11:39 intervene positively in your life.
00:11:43 Notice what it says at Ephesians 3:20:
00:11:48 “Now to the one who can, according to his power
00:11:52 “that is operating in us,
00:11:54 “do more than superabundantly
00:11:56 beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”
00:12:02 The expression “his power that is operating in us”
00:12:07 —is this not something very encouraging and faith-strengthening?
00:12:12 His power is not just “operating in us”
00:12:15 but “operating in us . . . superabundantly”
00:12:20 —no, but “more than superabundantly,”
00:12:22 beyond what we can envision or comprehend.
00:12:27 “He will draw close to you,”
00:12:29 says James 4:8.
00:12:33 Whether he wrote Psalm 119 or not,
00:12:35 Hezekiah strengthened his faith in Jehovah and trusted him.
00:12:40 He did so even though he was surrounded by false worshippers
00:12:44 and may have been ridiculed by members of the royal court.
00:12:50 Jehovah blessed Hezekiah.
00:12:52 If you trust Jehovah, he will bless you as well.
00:12:57 With reliance on God,
00:12:59 you too can endure trials
00:13:02 as integrity-keepers.
00:13:05 Apply Bible principles in your life,
00:13:08 and see how following Jehovah’s advice
00:13:11 will always work out for your good.
00:13:16 Strong faith in God’s love helps us to see beyond our imperfections
00:13:20 or the negative experiences that we may have had in the past.
00:13:25 We see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us
00:13:28 —as a cherished part of his household.
00:13:32 We are a family member of Jehovah’s family.
00:13:38 Notice the encouragement we receive
00:13:40 at Psalm 119
00:13:42 and verse 32.
00:13:48 Faith in God’s love gives us the confidence
00:13:51 that we need to keep going.
00:13:56 At Psalm 119:32, it says:
00:14:04 “I will eagerly pursue the way of your commandments
00:14:08 because you make room for it in my heart.”
00:14:14 The footnote says: “Or possibly, ‘you make my heart have the confidence.’”
00:14:19 We will be able to endure any trial.
00:14:23 Are there things that can separate us
00:14:26 from Jehovah’s love toward us?
00:14:30 Do you recall what we are told at Romans chapter 8?
00:14:35 Nothing can separate us from Jehovah’s love toward us.
00:14:40 Let’s read this together,
00:14:43 Romans chapter 8
00:14:46 and verses 35 to 39:
00:14:55 “Who will separate us from the love of the Christ?
00:14:58 “Will tribulation or distress or persecution
00:15:02 “or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?
00:15:06 “Just as it is written:
00:15:08 “‘For your sake we are being put to death all day long;
00:15:11 “we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.’
00:15:16 “On the contrary, in all these things
00:15:18 “we are coming off completely victorious
00:15:23 “through the one who loved us.
00:15:26 “For I am convinced that neither death nor life
00:15:29 “nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come
00:15:32 “nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation
00:15:36 “will be able to separate us from God’s love
00:15:40 that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
00:15:45 But there are things that can diminish or kill our love for Jehovah,
00:15:50 so we need to be careful.
00:15:54 This symposium has reminded us
00:15:56 of why we have faith in God’s existence,
00:16:00 his Word, his moral standards,
00:16:03 and his love.
00:16:05 As the world around us grows more hopeless,
00:16:09 we are determined to become
00:16:11 more and more powerful by faith!
00:16:16 About Abraham, Romans 4:20 says:
00:16:21 “But because of the promise of God,
00:16:23 “he did not waver in a lack of faith;
00:16:26 but he became powerful by his faith, giving God glory.”
00:16:32 Similarly, Jehovah has also given promises to us.
00:16:37 And as he progressively fulfills them,
00:16:40 we become more and more “powerful by [our] faith”
00:16:45 and give glory to Jehovah God!

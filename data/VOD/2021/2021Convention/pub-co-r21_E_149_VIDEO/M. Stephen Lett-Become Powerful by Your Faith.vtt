A building constructed
with steel-reinforced concrete

A tree with strong, deep roots

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can remain standing
in the face of many powerful storms.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An athlete made powerful by rigorous training

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can successfully complete a decathlon

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a ten-event athletic contest.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as a building, a tree,

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an athlete can be powerful,

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as Jehovah’s people

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be powerful by means of our faith.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will discuss during this talk
how faith

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a product of holy spirit,
the most powerful force in the universe—

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can reinforce, or fortify, us

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for any (and I mean any)

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
test, trial, or temptation

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes our way.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, even though
we may not feel powerful physically

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or emotionally,

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith can make us powerful spiritually.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And spiritual power is much more valuable

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:20.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than physical or emotional power.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With spiritual power, we can be like Abraham.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to Romans chapter 4,

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what was said about Abraham,
beginning in verse number 18:

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Although beyond hope, yet based on hope,

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:42.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he had faith that he would become
the father of many nations

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to what had been said:
‘So your offspring will be.’

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And although he did not grow weak in faith,

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he considered his own body,
now as good as dead

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:56.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(since he was about 100 years old),

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as well as the deadness
of the womb of Sarah.

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did not waver in a lack of faith;

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:08.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he [now notice]

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“became powerful by his faith,

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“giving God glory and being fully convinced

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that what He [Jehovah] had promised

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He [Jehovah] was also able to do.”

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though almost 100 years old

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:31.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and Abraham likely
would have been frail physically

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and emotionally weak at times—

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:37.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his faith made him powerful.

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, his faith made him so powerful

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he believed this extraordinary promise
with all his heart

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:48.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that his almost 90-year-old wife, Sarah,

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:53.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would give birth to a son
and that it would definitely come true.

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:58.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though that promise
was unbelievable from a human standpoint,

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had no doubt whatsoever.

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:06.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise, if our faith
makes us powerful,

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:10.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will fully believe
all of Jehovah’s promises

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how extraordinary they may seem.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:18.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will do so without doubting whatsoever.

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now think about this comparison
to Abraham:

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:27.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An older, frail,
chronically ill servant of Jehovah

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may seem weak,

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:33.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but outward appearance can be very deceptive.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:36.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that one has been empowered by faith,

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then he is truly strong, just like Abraham.

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this wonderful convention

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was designed to fortify our faith

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:51.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it will empower us to be so strong

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:55.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll be able to endure
whatever test, trial, and temptation

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:57.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes against us.

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:01.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there will actually be no breaking point

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our integrity.

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s talk about how each day
of our convention

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our outstanding drama

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have strengthened our faith.

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk about Friday.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day’s theme was a quote from Luke 17:5:

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:24.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these were the humble words
of Jesus’ apostles

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who recognized their need for more faith,

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:34.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were humbly pleading for such.

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we feel the same way, don’t we?

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know we need more faith,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we humbly ask Jehovah for it.

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:43.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is,

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:48.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jehovah answer our pleas for more faith?

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:50.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he will.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Friday revealed
some of the ways Jehovah answers

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our humble plea for more faith.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As illuminated on Friday,

00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:02.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives us faith

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
primarily by means of two books

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible and the book of creation.

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:14.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first symposium showed
how the Bible builds faith

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s existence;

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:20.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it builds faith in itself,
that it’s the Word of God;

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it builds faith in God’s moral standards;

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:27.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it builds faith in God’s love for us.

00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask that first part,

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:33.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does the Bible build faith
in God’s existence?

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:36.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, within its pages,

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it gives us common sense,
reasoning from scriptures

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:42.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Hebrews 3:4.

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:44.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you know what that says?

00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:47.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Of course,

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every house is constructed by someone,

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:54.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who constructed all things is God.”

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:58.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you could never convince
any sane person

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:03.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a beautiful house
designed and built itself.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more so,

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:09.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it should not be possible
to convince any rational person

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all the beautiful creations around us

00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just designed and built themselves

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they’re the product of blind chance.

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:22.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where there is design,

00:06:22.778 --> 00:06:26.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is always a designer.

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:28.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s illustrate this:

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many times

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:33.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you have to throw
black paint from a can

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:36.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
onto a white ceiling

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:38.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you produced

00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:41.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a perfect map of New York City,

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:46.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the paint particles scattered
accurately identifying all of the streets,

00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the highways, the tunnels, the bridges,
the overpasses, and the landmarks

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and correctly named each one?

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you could do that
for billions of times,

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never would you produce
a perfect map of New York City.

00:07:01.024 --> 00:07:03.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to add a little humor:

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say you tried doing this
for 100 billion years, and you get excited.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You finally got a city map.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:11.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, oh, no!

00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:16.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not New York City;
it’s Warwick, New York.

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:20.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’ve got to start all over,
going for that map of New York City.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to give you a little humor.

00:07:22.587 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think of this: One living human cell

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:30.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is much more complex,

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:32.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intricately designed,

00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:34.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a map of New York City.

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one human body

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:40.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made up of about 100 trillion
of such amazing cells

00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:44.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all working together harmoniously.

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:49.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the second part,
how does the Bible build faith in itself

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:51.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that it is the Word of God?

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:55.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing,
everything the Bible recommends

00:07:55.787 --> 00:07:59.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
works and brings superior results

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:03.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how to raise children,
how to have a happy marriage, and so forth.

00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:07.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:
Humans simply aren’t smart enough

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:10.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recommend only what works,

00:08:10.802 --> 00:08:15.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their advice is constantly being revised
and updated, isn’t it?

00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:19.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though written hundreds,
thousands, of years ago,

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible has never needed to be revised.

00:08:21.938 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, everything it recommends works.

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:29.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to be from a higher source
than humans.

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the third part, how does the Bible

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build faith in God’s moral standards?

00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:37.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it tells us what they are.

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:39.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It encourages us to obey them,

00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:42.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we do,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it protects us physically,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:48.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get happiness;
we get a good conscience;

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we experience the benefits.

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:54.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, we don’t have to learn
the painful process

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:57.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of trial and error.

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a saying
that “experience is the best teacher”

00:09:01.853 --> 00:09:03.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—completely wrong.

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:07.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experience is a school of hard knocks.

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:10.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the best Teacher.

00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:15.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is . . . making
the inexperienced one wise,”

00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:18.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Psalm 19:7.

00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:21.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the fourth part, how does the Bible

00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:23.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build faith in God’s love for us?

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:25.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most powerful way is,

00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it explains how Jehovah gave
his firstborn Son to die for us

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:33.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could have everlasting life.

00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:37.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about it:
What do most people give away

00:09:37.055 --> 00:09:39.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they give something away?

00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:43.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something they don’t need
or at least something they can do without.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave at great cost,

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:49.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great pain to himself.

00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:51.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evolution teaches

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:54.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our ancestors were apes.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could we feel happy and feel loved

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:04.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that an ape was our father?

00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:06.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our real Father, Jehovah,

00:10:06.668 --> 00:10:10.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the personification of love.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, on Friday afternoon,

00:10:14.718 --> 00:10:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had our second symposium,

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:20.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which opened the book of creation.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And peering into this book

00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:25.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can empower our faith.

00:10:25.187 --> 00:10:30.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk about that first talk
that dealt with the stars.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:26 tells us

00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:37.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah created all of them

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:41.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘he calls all of them by name.’

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:44.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s ponder this for a moment:

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:46.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long would it take you

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to name just the stars
in the Milky Way galaxy

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:53.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you named one every second?

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph, Paul, Rachel, Sarah.

00:10:57.469 --> 00:10:59.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, scientists estimate

00:10:59.804 --> 00:11:04.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are perhaps 400 billion stars

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:06.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:10.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you named one a second,
it would take you 400 billion seconds.

00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:12.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how long is that?

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:15.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twelve thousand six hundred
and eighty four years

00:11:15.862 --> 00:11:18.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than twice the time that has passed

00:11:18.532 --> 00:11:21.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the creation of Adam.

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:24.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you could go to the next galaxy.

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And scientists estimate

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there may be two trillion galaxies
in the universe.

00:11:31.586 --> 00:11:35.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s five times the number of galaxies

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:39.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our individual stars in the Milky Way.

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:43.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you ponder that,
it will really give you a headache.

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah created, sustains,

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and calls every one of them by name.

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:52.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the talk made the point
that if Jehovah can do that,

00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:56.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will have no problem
remembering and recreating

00:11:56.278 --> 00:12:00.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:04.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second talk examined
the page in the book of creation

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:06.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the oceans.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How powerful they are!

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:13.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the One who made them
is vastly more powerful.

00:12:13.587 --> 00:12:18.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our powerful God
definitely can protect us now

00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:22.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right through the great tribulation.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third talk examined
the page in creation about the forests,

00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:32.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was discussed how forests
have the amazing ability

00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:35.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to repair and renew themselves.

00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the point was made that the One
who has the wisdom to create such forests

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:44.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely knows how to undo all the damage

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:48.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that man has done to the planet Earth.

00:12:48.413 --> 00:12:52.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fourth talk focused on wind and water,

00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:57.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it talked about how Jehovah
has in the past used wind and water

00:12:57.422 --> 00:13:00.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and especially water in the form of hail—

00:13:00.508 --> 00:13:05.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defeat his enemies and deliver his people.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he will use them again at Armageddon.

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fifth talk took a glimpse

00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:15.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the fascinating world of sea creatures,

00:13:15.565 --> 00:13:19.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we looked at the largest animal alive
on earth today

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the blue whale.

00:13:21.112 --> 00:13:24.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what an appetite

00:13:24.115 --> 00:13:26.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that blue whale has!

00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:28.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can eat, according to the video,

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:32.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tons of food every day.

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:34.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah feeds it.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if he can do that,

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can he not feed and care for us,

00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:42.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continue to seek first the Kingdom?

00:13:42.926 --> 00:13:45.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our faith was strengthened

00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he can and he will.

00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:53.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last talk examined our amazing bodies.

00:13:53.144 --> 00:13:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed, it’s miraculous

00:13:56.773 --> 00:14:00.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how our bodies heal
and repair themselves when damaged.

00:14:00.944 --> 00:14:04.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think of this:
If you damage, scrape, or dent your car,

00:14:04.614 --> 00:14:06.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it heal itself?

00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hardly!

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:11.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if every time we bruised, scraped,

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or damaged our body

00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:15.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just stayed that way?

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:20.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a short time,
we’d get to looking pretty rough.

00:14:20.714 --> 00:14:24.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the God who made our bodies
in this miraculous way

00:14:24.968 --> 00:14:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
certainly can heal all infirmities,

00:14:27.804 --> 00:14:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reverse aging,

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:32.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prevent sickness in his new world.

00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:36.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has promised to do that.

00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:38.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the third symposium

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:42.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went back to our main book that builds faith
—the Bible.

00:14:42.444 --> 00:14:44.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed those

00:14:44.571 --> 00:14:47.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who acquired strong faith,

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:49.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we discussed how they did it.

00:14:49.868 --> 00:14:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though their contemporaries
were faithless,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they developed this faith.

00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:58.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our faith was empowered

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we discussed Abel, Enoch, Noah,

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:05.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses, and Jesus’ disciples,

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we became more determined than ever

00:15:08.845 --> 00:15:11.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imitate these faithful ones

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:14.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not their faithless contemporaries.

00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:17.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know we can be successful

00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:20.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have the same Father, Helper,

00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:25.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supplier of holy spirit as they had.

00:15:25.737 --> 00:15:28.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our three symposiums on Friday

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly showed us

00:15:31.034 --> 00:15:35.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah answers our pleas for more faith
by means of two books

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible and the book of creation.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But regarding our drama, we ask,

00:15:42.128 --> 00:15:44.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jehovah answer

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:48.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel’s pleas for more faith?

00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:52.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one way was
he gave Daniel his written Word.

00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:57.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the drama, if you recall,
Daniel’s father gave him a scroll

00:15:57.268 --> 00:16:00.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he regularly referred to.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you recognize that scroll?

00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scroll depicted in the drama

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:08.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is known today as Psalm 27.

00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When enemies tried to discredit Daniel,

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:16.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw him reflect on Psalm 27:11, 12,
which says in part:

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:20.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not hand me over to my adversaries,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for false witnesses
have risen up against me,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they threaten me with violence.”

00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:29.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was threatened with execution,

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw him reflect

00:16:31.803 --> 00:16:35.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Psalm 27:7-9,

00:16:35.348 --> 00:16:37.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says in part:

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are my helper;

00:16:39.352 --> 00:16:42.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not forsake me or leave me,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my God of salvation.”

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:47.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How those verses

00:16:47.819 --> 00:16:51.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have bolstered Daniel’s faith!

00:16:51.948 --> 00:16:55.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we cannot say for sure
that Daniel reflected

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:57.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on those specific verses,

00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:01.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the Bible does reveal that Daniel’s faith

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:05.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indeed was strengthened by the Scriptures.

00:17:05.003 --> 00:17:07.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Daniel

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a keen student of Bible prophecy.

00:17:10.133 --> 00:17:13.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even said of himself at Daniel 9:2:

00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:16.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Daniel, discerned by the books

00:17:16.514 --> 00:17:19.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[that is, the sacred books]
the number of years.”

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he talks about the desolation
(restoration) of Jerusalem

00:17:23.354 --> 00:17:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“namely, 70 years.”

00:17:27.108 --> 00:17:29.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask, Will Jehovah answer

00:17:29.903 --> 00:17:32.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our pleas for more faith?

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most definitely he will.

00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one outstanding way he has done this

00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:42.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by providing us with Bible prophecy.

00:17:42.582 --> 00:17:47.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prophecies in the book of Daniel alone
have helped millions

00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build rock-solid faith.

00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:52.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the fulfilled prophecies

00:17:52.717 --> 00:17:56.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the king of the north
and the king of the south

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been very faith-strengthening.

00:17:58.848 --> 00:18:02.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s review the video on this topic

00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:07.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that appeared in Brother Kenneth Cook’s
May broadcast.

00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:09.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy this powerful video.

00:18:13.404 --> 00:18:15.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel received a prophecy

00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:17.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coming of two rivals:

00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:19.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”

00:18:19.285 --> 00:18:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the king of the south.”

00:18:21.704 --> 00:18:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has it been fulfilled?

00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:33.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1800’s, the German Empire

00:18:33.466 --> 00:18:35.510 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.970 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That government brought

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.262 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
its “power and . . . heart

00:18:38.262 --> 00:18:39.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“against the king of the south

00:18:39.555 --> 00:18:42.183 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a large army.”

00:18:42.183 --> 00:18:44.394 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, its navy was

00:18:44.394 --> 00:18:46.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the second largest on earth.

00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:51.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Who became the king of the south?

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:53.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The alliance between Britain

00:18:53.861 --> 00:18:56.072 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the United States.

00:18:56.072 --> 00:18:58.074 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He fought during World War I

00:18:58.074 --> 00:19:00.076 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“with an exceedingly large

00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:01.953 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and mighty army.”

00:19:01.953 --> 00:19:04.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He “swept away” and “humbled”

00:19:04.372 --> 00:19:06.582 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.168 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that was not the end

00:19:09.168 --> 00:19:11.254 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:19:11.254 --> 00:19:13.381 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He turned his attention to and then hurled

00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:16.384 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“denunciations against the holy covenant.”

00:19:18.011 --> 00:19:20.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He removed “the constant feature”

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:22.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by limiting the freedom of God’s people

00:19:22.265 --> 00:19:25.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to preach,

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:27.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning many,

00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:29.313 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and even killing hundreds

00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:30.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s anointed ones

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their fellow workers.

00:19:34.652 --> 00:19:37.196 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After Germany was defeated in World War II,

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:39.198 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union

00:19:39.198 --> 00:19:41.284 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:19:41.284 --> 00:19:43.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It worked with the king of the south

00:19:43.286 --> 00:19:45.663 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “put in place the disgusting thing

00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:48.166 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that causes desolation”

00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:50.376 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the United Nations.

00:19:59.844 --> 00:20:02.472 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in the early 1900’s,

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:04.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet government tried to eliminate

00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:07.393 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
religion in the lands under its control,

00:20:09.103 --> 00:20:10.521 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling the words

00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:12.106 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he would “show no regard

00:20:12.106 --> 00:20:14.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the God of his fathers.”

00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:21.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He gave glory, not to the God of heaven,

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:24.077 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but “to the god of fortresses.”

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied,

00:20:26.704 --> 00:20:28.539 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he used this military might

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:30.083 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
against the king of the south

00:20:30.083 --> 00:20:33.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by engaging “with him in a pushing.”

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:34.712 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Anglo-America competed

00:20:34.712 --> 00:20:35.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Soviet Union

00:20:35.838 --> 00:20:37.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for world domination,

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.926 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fighting in and supporting wars

00:20:39.926 --> 00:20:42.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and political struggles around the globe.

00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:50.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,

00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:53.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was unclear who would fill the role
of the king of the north.

00:20:54.315 --> 00:20:56.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a time, God’s people there

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been able to preach
and worship peacefully.

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:03.324 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in recent years, Russia and its allies

00:21:03.324 --> 00:21:06.244 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have pushed back at the king of the south.

00:21:06.244 --> 00:21:08.246 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both kings have accused each other

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:11.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:21:12.291 --> 00:21:14.710 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the king of the north has not limited

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.046 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his attacks to the king of the south.

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:19.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As foretold, he also entered

00:21:19.132 --> 00:21:22.510 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“into the land of the Decoration”

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.720 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—our realm of spiritual activity.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:28.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russian authorities continue

00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:30.434 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attack true worship.

00:21:32.186 --> 00:21:35.314 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We expect such persecution,

00:21:35.314 --> 00:21:38.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but we also expect it to end.

00:21:56.919 --> 00:21:59.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our King, Jesus Christ,

00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:02.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more powerful than any human government.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he will destroy
not only the kings of the north and the south

00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all of his enemies,

00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:15.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will deliver God’s loyal people.

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:47.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful video!

00:22:48.012 --> 00:22:51.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has the unerring accuracy of those prophecies

00:22:51.557 --> 00:22:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthened your faith?

00:22:54.477 --> 00:22:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re confident that it has.

00:22:56.604 --> 00:23:00.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re absolutely convinced
that the rest of that prophecy,

00:23:00.441 --> 00:23:02.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including our deliverance,

00:23:02.443 --> 00:23:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be fulfilled.

00:23:04.654 --> 00:23:08.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christ soon will defend God’s people

00:23:08.783 --> 00:23:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring an end
to this entire wicked system.

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:16.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us continue to study

00:23:16.249 --> 00:23:19.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these and other prophecies.

00:23:19.627 --> 00:23:22.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, our faith

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our wise, our all-powerful,
our loving Father

00:23:27.176 --> 00:23:30.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will definitely be strengthened.

00:23:30.388 --> 00:23:33.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s move to Saturday’s program,

00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:37.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which had the theme taken from Jude 3:

00:23:37.687 --> 00:23:41.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith.”

00:23:41.315 --> 00:23:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The symposium
“Successful Fighters for the Faith”

00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:50.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed that many who do not have a spouse

00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:54.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many whose spouse
is not yet serving Jehovah

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are winning their fight for the faith.

00:23:57.415 --> 00:23:59.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we warmly commend

00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:03.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you dear, beloved ones.

00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:08.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The baptism discourse
encouraged new disciples

00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:11.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue strengthening their faith,

00:24:11.345 --> 00:24:16.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we warmly welcome
all newly baptized ones.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves you very much.

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:21.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body loves you very much.

00:24:21.147 --> 00:24:24.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your brothers and sisters love you very much.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re so happy to have you join us

00:24:27.987 --> 00:24:30.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our united family

00:24:30.489 --> 00:24:34.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of intense fighters for the faith.

00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:38.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two afternoon symposiums

00:24:38.247 --> 00:24:42.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped us to analyze
how we can show our faith

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving of our time,

00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:47.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
energy, and material things

00:24:47.715 --> 00:24:51.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance the Kingdom work
and to help others.

00:24:51.552 --> 00:24:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed some specific things
that we may be able to do.

00:24:55.931 --> 00:25:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, learn a new language,

00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:03.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move and serve where the need is greater,

00:25:03.647 --> 00:25:07.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:09.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assist with a building project,

00:25:09.987 --> 00:25:14.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “set something aside” for Jehovah’s work.

00:25:15.868 --> 00:25:19.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The talk “Put Up a Hard Fight for the Faith!”

00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:23.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminded us that as is true in all fights

00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:25.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in our fight—

00:25:25.753 --> 00:25:28.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have enemies.

00:25:28.005 --> 00:25:32.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, we must reject apostate lies

00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:35.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the false stories of other opposers,

00:25:35.596 --> 00:25:40.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are designed to sow doubt
and weaken faith.

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:42.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is very skilled

00:25:42.728 --> 00:25:46.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at using innuendo, half-truths, and lies.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not surprising that the news media

00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:55.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which is often manipulated by apostates,
clergymen, and other opposers—

00:25:55.366 --> 00:25:59.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likewise often employs innuendo,

00:25:59.703 --> 00:26:02.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
half-truths, and lies

00:26:02.164 --> 00:26:05.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Jehovah’s organization.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about this:
Faith is a product of holy spirit.

00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:14.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a provision from Jehovah
to strengthen us,

00:26:14.301 --> 00:26:16.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas doubt

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a tool of the Devil designed to weaken us.

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:25.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall how Satan approached Eve?

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:27.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it really so

00:26:27.523 --> 00:26:31.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God said you must not eat
from every tree of the garden?”

00:26:31.902 --> 00:26:34.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is that really so?’

00:26:34.155 --> 00:26:36.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he present it that way?

00:26:36.323 --> 00:26:38.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To plant doubt

00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘shipwreck her faith,’ and he succeeded.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise, if we’re not careful,

00:26:44.123 --> 00:26:47.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubt can shipwreck our faith.

00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:49.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But strong faith

00:26:49.044 --> 00:26:53.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keeps doubt out of our hearts and minds.

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:56.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, in talking just a little bit more
about apostates,

00:26:56.886 --> 00:27:01.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what if an apostate knocked
at your front door and said,

00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:05.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’d like to come into your home,
I’d like to sit down with you,

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:09.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d like to teach you
some apostate ideas”?

00:27:09.982 --> 00:27:13.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, you would immediately
get rid of him, wouldn’t you?

00:27:13.194 --> 00:27:16.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would send him down the highway.

00:27:16.113 --> 00:27:18.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now think of this:
What if that same apostate

00:27:18.824 --> 00:27:22.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tries to come into your home
by means of the television

00:27:22.453 --> 00:27:24.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or computer?

00:27:24.455 --> 00:27:27.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, hopefully, we reject him

00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:30.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as decisively.

00:27:30.294 --> 00:27:33.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second John 10 says:

00:27:33.047 --> 00:27:37.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If anyone comes to you
and does not bring this teaching,

00:27:37.718 --> 00:27:41.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[never] receive him into your homes”

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that would mean not through the front door,

00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:47.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not through the television, or computer.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, though, some have reasoned foolishly:

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I listen to this apostate
on television or the computer

00:27:55.152 --> 00:27:57.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or perhaps read his book,

00:27:57.279 --> 00:28:00.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll recognize how wrong he is.

00:28:00.199 --> 00:28:02.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’ll build up my faith.

00:28:02.284 --> 00:28:05.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And if I ever encounter this teaching
in the ministry,

00:28:05.829 --> 00:28:08.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll better be able to refute it.’

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:13.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is foolish thinking indeed.

00:28:13.003 --> 00:28:15.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be like reasoning,

00:28:15.256 --> 00:28:19.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I eat stinky, rotten, food
from a garbage can,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘it will really help me in the future

00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:25.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recognize bad food.’

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:27.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not very good reasoning, is it?

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:33.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than feed our minds
poisonous, apostate ideas,

00:28:33.107 --> 00:28:35.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read God’s Word daily

00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:40.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen and safeguard our faith.

00:28:40.155 --> 00:28:42.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask, How did Daniel

00:28:42.866 --> 00:28:45.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put up a hard fight for the faith?

00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, he resisted pressure

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:52.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to compromise.

00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:55.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine the pressure
he must have faced

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:59.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when offered the king’s delicacies and wine?

00:28:59.383 --> 00:29:01.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was he able to refuse?

00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:06.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for the answer,
let’s go to Daniel chapter 1, please,

00:29:06.974 --> 00:29:11.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse number 8.

00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:14.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 1:8: “But Daniel

00:29:14.189 --> 00:29:17.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“resolved in his heart

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:21.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he would not defile himself
with the king’s delicacies

00:29:21.822 --> 00:29:24.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or with the wine he drank.

00:29:24.158 --> 00:29:27.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he asked the principal court official
for permission

00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:31.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to defile himself in this way.”

00:29:31.498 --> 00:29:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, in advance,

00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel “resolved in his heart”

00:29:37.046 --> 00:29:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the course he was going to take.

00:29:39.548 --> 00:29:43.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did so because he was fully convinced

00:29:43.218 --> 00:29:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that whatever Jehovah had commanded

00:29:45.888 --> 00:29:48.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for his good.

00:29:50.142 --> 00:29:55.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Daniel, we must put up
a hard fight for the faith.

00:29:56.023 --> 00:29:58.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you facing pressure right now

00:29:58.776 --> 00:30:03.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at school, at work, or even at home—

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to compromise?

00:30:05.074 --> 00:30:08.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, please don’t give up

00:30:08.869 --> 00:30:11.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t give in.

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:14.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect on Daniel’s example,

00:30:14.124 --> 00:30:16.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fight for your faith.

00:30:16.835 --> 00:30:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be resolved to obey Jehovah because doing so

00:30:21.423 --> 00:30:23.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always the right thing,

00:30:23.425 --> 00:30:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you do, you will have no regrets.

00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:33.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pressure was also put on Daniel
by means of threats.

00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:36.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine how Daniel felt
when he became aware

00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:41.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his next prayer
could lead to his execution?

00:30:41.318 --> 00:30:44.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped him to stay loyal?

00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:47.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go to Daniel chapter 6

00:30:47.282 --> 00:30:49.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get some help with that question.

00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:52.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 6

00:30:52.037 --> 00:30:56.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, please, let’s read together
verse number 10:

00:30:57.501 --> 00:31:00.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as soon as Daniel knew

00:31:00.087 --> 00:31:02.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the decree had been signed,

00:31:02.756 --> 00:31:04.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he went to his house,

00:31:04.758 --> 00:31:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which had the windows of his roof chamber
open toward Jerusalem.

00:31:08.804 --> 00:31:12.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And three times a day
he got down on his knees

00:31:12.558 --> 00:31:16.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and prayed and offered praise
before his God,

00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice] as he had regularly done

00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:23.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prior to this.”

00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:26.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Daniel knew what was right,

00:31:26.113 --> 00:31:28.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he didn’t hesitate to do it,

00:31:28.407 --> 00:31:30.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was consistent in his worship.

00:31:30.993 --> 00:31:34.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 6:16 tells us

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Daniel
was “continually serving” his God.

00:31:38.792 --> 00:31:42.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower </i> explains
that the original Bible word

00:31:42.004 --> 00:31:44.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translated “continually serving”

00:31:44.173 --> 00:31:48.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
basically means to “move in a circle,”

00:31:48.677 --> 00:31:51.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which suggests continuity.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how well that describes
Daniel’s unbroken worship!

00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:57.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, there’s no end to a circle.

00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s unbroken, is it not?

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:04.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following dramatization

00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:09.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that depicts a brother
who faces a threat of being arrested.

00:32:09.072 --> 00:32:12.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by reflecting on Daniel’s example,

00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:17.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is helped to continue serving Jehovah
with constancy

00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:21.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the face
of this intimidating circumstance.

00:32:24.171 --> 00:32:27.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s still chaos in many parts of the city,

00:32:27.174 --> 00:32:29.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with armed soldiers detaining and arresting

00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:30.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 those not pledging support

00:32:30.928 --> 00:32:31.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the new government.

00:32:33.931 --> 00:32:36.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we still going to the meeting tonight?

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:40.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to do what was best

00:32:40.562 --> 00:32:42.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for my wife and daughter.

00:32:46.318 --> 00:32:47.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a few of the elders

00:32:47.945 --> 00:32:50.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have already been arrested.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if I was arrested?

00:33:08.006 --> 00:33:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would happen to my family?

00:33:30.904 --> 00:33:32.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not going home to pray, are you?

00:33:32.948 --> 00:33:36.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray at my window three times a day,

00:33:36.785 --> 00:33:38.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I even appear to compromise,

00:33:45.043 --> 00:33:47.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they think?

00:33:47.838 --> 00:33:49.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah.

00:33:49.923 --> 00:33:51.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I trust him,

00:33:52.759 --> 00:33:54.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

00:33:54.928 --> 00:33:57.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

00:33:59.975 --> 00:34:02.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that I keep my faith

00:34:05.689 --> 00:34:08.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we all keep our faith—

00:34:08.483 --> 00:34:10.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how this ends.

00:34:14.698 --> 00:34:16.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are clear.

00:34:16.867 --> 00:34:18.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must continue to meet together,

00:34:18.702 --> 00:34:20.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in small groups if necessary.

00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:23.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just pray that whatever happens,

00:34:23.624 --> 00:34:26.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the strength to endure it.

00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:31.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear Jehovah God, please . . .

00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:34.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I was arrested.

00:34:45.812 --> 00:34:47.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We miss you so much,

00:34:47.898 --> 00:34:50.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re very proud of you.

00:34:50.943 --> 00:34:53.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know whatever the outcome of your trial,

00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:55.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll maintain your faith,

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will we.

00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:01.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you scared?

00:35:02.537 --> 00:35:04.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very scared,

00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:09.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah helps us when we’re scared.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I would be OK

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah

00:35:17.177 --> 00:35:19.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would take care of my family.

00:35:21.932 --> 00:35:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As was true of the brother in our video,

00:35:25.435 --> 00:35:28.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be persecuted.

00:35:28.438 --> 00:35:30.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 3:12 says:

00:35:30.816 --> 00:35:34.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those desiring to live
with godly devotion

00:35:34.319 --> 00:35:37.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in association with Christ Jesus

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also be persecuted.”

00:35:40.701 --> 00:35:43.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t say maybe, good chance, probably

00:35:43.954 --> 00:35:45.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘will be persecuted.’

00:35:45.998 --> 00:35:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s guaranteed.

00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:50.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like our brother in the video,

00:35:50.877 --> 00:35:55.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when persecuted,
let’s reflect on Daniel’s example

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s fight for our faith.

00:35:57.843 --> 00:36:01.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then let’s pray,
confident that our God

00:36:01.847 --> 00:36:05.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always mightier than our enemies.

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be like young David
when he went out to meet Goliath.

00:36:10.313 --> 00:36:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, David saw the big picture, didn’t he?

00:36:12.315 --> 00:36:14.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, he saw how big Goliath was,

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:16.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the big picture,

00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:20.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw how puny Goliath was

00:36:20.198 --> 00:36:24.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to his almighty God, Jehovah.

00:36:25.537 --> 00:36:29.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a unique way, Daniel also experienced

00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how mighty Jehovah is

00:36:31.126 --> 00:36:33.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:36:33.795 --> 00:36:38.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sent an angel
to shut the mouths of those lions.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about it: Those lions
obviously were very hungry

00:36:41.762 --> 00:36:45.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because a little bit later
when people were thrown in there,

00:36:45.098 --> 00:36:48.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were consumed
before they hit the bottom of the pit.

00:36:48.477 --> 00:36:50.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they were very hungry,

00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:53.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Daniel would have looked
like a tasty morsel.

00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:56.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter how hard they tried,

00:36:56.735 --> 00:37:00.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those lions couldn’t get their mouths open

00:37:00.155 --> 00:37:02.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to harm Daniel.

00:37:02.908 --> 00:37:05.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel also set a good example

00:37:05.744 --> 00:37:09.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in remaining hopeful despite old age

00:37:09.372 --> 00:37:11.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and infirmities.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine how Daniel felt
when he was almost 100 years old

00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:19.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many Jews left
for their beloved homeland, Judah,

00:37:19.633 --> 00:37:22.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was unable to go with them?

00:37:22.052 --> 00:37:25.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped him to keep his hope alive?

00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:29.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go to Daniel chapter 10, please.

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:32.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see one thing that helped Daniel.

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:36.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Daniel chapter 10 and beginning
in verse 18, Daniel says:

00:37:36.942 --> 00:37:40.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who looked like a man
touched me again

00:37:40.529 --> 00:37:42.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and strengthened me.

00:37:42.656 --> 00:37:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he said: ‘Do not be afraid,
O very precious man.

00:37:47.536 --> 00:37:49.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘May you have peace.

00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:53.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be strong, yes, be strong.’

00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:57.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As he spoke with me I was strengthened

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I said: ‘Let my lord speak,

00:38:01.049 --> 00:38:04.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you have strengthened me.’”

00:38:04.094 --> 00:38:08.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So through an angel, Jehovah reassured Daniel

00:38:08.598 --> 00:38:13.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was precious
and still very useful to Him.

00:38:13.603 --> 00:38:16.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Daniel accepted
the encouragement, didn’t he?

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thereafter, Jehovah
gave him a thrilling prophecy

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the king of the north
and the king of the south, which he recorded

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:25.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our benefit.

00:38:25.991 --> 00:38:30.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although old and infirm, this precious man

00:38:30.036 --> 00:38:34.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was still very useful to Jehovah.

00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:38.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following dramatization

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which an older brother who feels helpless

00:38:42.424 --> 00:38:46.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflects on how the angel reassured Daniel.

00:38:55.061 --> 00:38:58.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all went by so quickly

00:39:00.734 --> 00:39:02.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pioneering,

00:39:05.447 --> 00:39:07.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreign language,

00:39:08.491 --> 00:39:10.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circuit work.

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:14.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was even a time

00:39:14.331 --> 00:39:17.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was the one encouraging older ones.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:21.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss those days so much.

00:39:23.173 --> 00:39:27.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now I’m the one in a nursing home.

00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:33.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I feel like I have

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing left to offer.

00:39:41.608 --> 00:39:43.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Daniel,

00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:46.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you very precious man.

00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:52.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been sent to you.

00:39:54.162 --> 00:39:56.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:39:56.498 --> 00:39:57.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words have been heard

00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the first day you gave your heart

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understanding.

00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:02.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no strength.

00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:05.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no breath left in me.

00:40:06.258 --> 00:40:08.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, O very precious man.

00:40:08.677 --> 00:40:10.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you have peace.

00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:12.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong!

00:40:19.604 --> 00:40:22.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.

00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:24.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on to the end.

00:40:24.484 --> 00:40:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will rest, but you will stand up

00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:30.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:35.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, just checking on you.

00:40:36.204 --> 00:40:37.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a minute?

00:40:37.497 --> 00:40:38.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something I’ve been wanting

00:40:38.707 --> 00:40:40.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share with you.

00:40:40.542 --> 00:40:42.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sure.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah does remember me,

00:40:55.307 --> 00:40:58.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I still have much to offer.

00:41:02.272 --> 00:41:06.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very touching video indeed!

00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:08.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask, Do you have infirmities

00:41:08.695 --> 00:41:11.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that keep you from doing
what you would like to do?

00:41:11.823 --> 00:41:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, reflect on Daniel’s example

00:41:15.618 --> 00:41:17.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and accept Jehovah’s reassurance.

00:41:17.996 --> 00:41:21.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember that what you used to do

00:41:21.416 --> 00:41:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is still viewed as valuable to Jehovah.

00:41:25.128 --> 00:41:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will not forget it.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your present acts of faithfulness,

00:41:30.842 --> 00:41:32.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if small,

00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are very precious to him.

00:41:35.805 --> 00:41:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We entreat all of you:

00:41:38.016 --> 00:41:40.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old,

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Daniel, do not stop

00:41:42.979 --> 00:41:46.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting up a hard fight for the faith.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s talk about today’s program,

00:41:50.528 --> 00:41:54.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has the theme taken from Matthew 21:21:

00:41:54.824 --> 00:41:59.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:04.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the morning, we enjoyed
the faith-strengthening symposium

00:42:04.334 --> 00:42:08.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!”

00:42:08.463 --> 00:42:10.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in each of the eight parts,

00:42:10.548 --> 00:42:14.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exemplary women of faith
who were discussed

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced mountainlike obstacles.

00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:22.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah had to leave a comfortable lifestyle

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a nomadic lifestyle,

00:42:24.312 --> 00:42:28.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for many years, she suffered barrenness.

00:42:28.358 --> 00:42:33.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab had to take decisive action
—risk her life—

00:42:33.363 --> 00:42:35.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect the Israelite spies

00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:38.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take a stand with God’s people.

00:42:38.034 --> 00:42:43.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, she had to give up
an immoral lifestyle.

00:42:43.039 --> 00:42:45.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah continued to serve Jehovah

00:42:45.792 --> 00:42:50.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while enduring many years of barrenness
and harassment from Peninnah.

00:42:51.131 --> 00:42:53.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The captive Israelite girl

00:42:53.174 --> 00:42:56.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was forcibly separated from her family

00:42:56.886 --> 00:42:59.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Syrian marauders

00:42:59.514 --> 00:43:03.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nevertheless continued
to fearlessly witness

00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:06.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to others about Jehovah.

00:43:06.604 --> 00:43:10.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary accepted the difficult assignment

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving birth to, caring for,

00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:15.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and training God’s Son.

00:43:15.947 --> 00:43:20.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Phoenician woman
courageously and persistently

00:43:20.201 --> 00:43:22.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sought help from Jesus

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her demon-possessed daughter.

00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she got that help, didn’t she?

00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:32.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha, after the painful loss
of her brother to the enemy death,

00:43:32.422 --> 00:43:36.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintained faith in Jesus’ ability

00:43:36.009 --> 00:43:38.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to raise the dead.

00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:42.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two modern-day examples
that we discussed in the last talk,

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters Ishii and Toom,

00:43:44.767 --> 00:43:48.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both steadfastly refused to compromise

00:43:48.813 --> 00:43:52.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite being imprisoned for many years

00:43:52.192 --> 00:43:55.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simply because they were
Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:43:55.653 --> 00:43:59.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each one of these dear sisters faced

00:43:59.491 --> 00:44:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mountainlike obstacles

00:44:02.327 --> 00:44:06.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah rewarded their faith.

00:44:06.748 --> 00:44:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith moved them
to expect good things from Jehovah,

00:44:11.294 --> 00:44:15.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah never ever let them down.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what good things
do we expect from Jehovah

00:44:19.135 --> 00:44:21.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we maintain strong faith?

00:44:21.804 --> 00:44:23.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about some of the events

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:27.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we expect to unfold in the near future.

00:44:27.185 --> 00:44:31.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for one thing, the final part
of Nebuchadnezzar’s image dream

00:44:31.022 --> 00:44:35.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussed in Daniel chapter 2
will be fulfilled.

00:44:35.777 --> 00:44:40.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As represented by the four upper parts
of that image,

00:44:40.198 --> 00:44:45.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four world powers have come and gone,

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:47.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as prophesied.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the Anglo-American World Power,

00:44:50.166 --> 00:44:54.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symbolized by the feet of iron and clay,

00:44:54.087 --> 00:44:56.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is dominating.

00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:59.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more than ever,
we see this last world power

00:44:59.259 --> 00:45:02.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living up to being a noncohesive mixture

00:45:02.845 --> 00:45:05.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of iron and clay.

00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:07.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as iron mixed with clay

00:45:07.892 --> 00:45:10.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is weaker than solid iron,

00:45:10.478 --> 00:45:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so too the Anglo-American World Power
is weaker

00:45:14.691 --> 00:45:19.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the ironlike Roman Empire
from which it emerged.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ability of the Anglo-American World Power
to act with ironlike strength

00:45:23.783 --> 00:45:27.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is weakened by claylike elements,

00:45:27.662 --> 00:45:31.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as people rising up
to claim their rights

00:45:31.416 --> 00:45:33.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through insurrection,

00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:36.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
civil rights campaigns,

00:45:36.337 --> 00:45:39.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and independence movements.

00:45:39.257 --> 00:45:42.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Daniel foretold in chapter 2, verse 42:

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:46.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The kingdom will be partly strong

00:45:46.931 --> 00:45:49.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and partly fragile.”

00:45:49.225 --> 00:45:54.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we see that is
more and more evident today than ever.

00:45:54.856 --> 00:45:59.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite the weakened condition
of this final world power,

00:45:59.777 --> 00:46:04.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will not simply disintegrate
into self-destruction.

00:46:04.782 --> 00:46:09.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to Daniel chapter 2,
and let’s notice how it comes to its end.

00:46:09.787 --> 00:46:13.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very familiar scripture here
—Daniel 2:44:

00:46:13.916 --> 00:46:17.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the days of those kings the God of heaven

00:46:17.378 --> 00:46:21.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will set up a kingdom
that will never be destroyed.

00:46:21.424 --> 00:46:25.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this kingdom will not be passed on
to any other people.

00:46:25.553 --> 00:46:30.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It will crush and put an end
to all these kingdoms,

00:46:30.433 --> 00:46:34.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it alone will stand forever,

00:46:34.103 --> 00:46:39.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as you saw that out of the mountain
a stone was cut not by hands

00:46:39.108 --> 00:46:42.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, not by human hands,
but by Jehovah’s hands],

00:46:42.779 --> 00:46:45.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that it crushed the iron, the copper,

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:49.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the clay, the silver, and the gold.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Grand God has made known to the king
what will happen in the future.

00:46:53.915 --> 00:46:55.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dream is true,

00:46:55.917 --> 00:46:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation is trustworthy.”

00:46:59.962 --> 00:47:03.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture describes how God’s Kingdom,

00:47:03.383 --> 00:47:05.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
represented by that stone,

00:47:05.718 --> 00:47:09.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will crush all human governments

00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:11.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Armageddon.

00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:16.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And interestingly, at Daniel 2:34,

00:47:16.604 --> 00:47:19.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us that ‘the stone [God’s Kingdom]

00:47:19.565 --> 00:47:22.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will strike the image
[representing human governments]

00:47:22.902 --> 00:47:26.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the feet of iron and clay,’

00:47:26.114 --> 00:47:29.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly identifying that Armageddon will come

00:47:29.992 --> 00:47:34.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the time
of the Anglo-American World Power

00:47:34.997 --> 00:47:38.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the final human world power.

00:47:38.918 --> 00:47:42.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Daniel, we have strong faith

00:47:42.588 --> 00:47:45.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last sentence of verse 45, which says:

00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:49.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dream is true, and its interpretation

00:47:49.637 --> 00:47:51.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is trustworthy.”

00:47:51.723 --> 00:47:55.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt about it:
God’s Kingdom will destroy

00:47:55.393 --> 00:47:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all human governments at Armageddon

00:47:57.687 --> 00:48:02.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the time
of the Anglo-American World Power.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, just as the final part
of the image dream

00:48:06.195 --> 00:48:08.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be fulfilled,

00:48:08.322 --> 00:48:12.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final part of Daniel’s vision
in chapter 7

00:48:12.869 --> 00:48:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be fulfilled.

00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:19.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in chapter 7,
Daniel describes four wild beasts,

00:48:19.876 --> 00:48:24.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which symbolize four world powers
that have come and gone.

00:48:24.881 --> 00:48:28.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And appropriately,
they’re described as wild beasts

00:48:28.801 --> 00:48:30.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they haven’t ruled kindly

00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:34.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, in a harsh, beastly way.

00:48:34.682 --> 00:48:37.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those four world powers

00:48:37.059 --> 00:48:40.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the very same four world powers

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
represented by the four upper metal parts

00:48:46.694 --> 00:48:51.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the image dream we discussed previously.

00:48:51.157 --> 00:48:56.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in verse 8, Daniel describes a horn

00:48:56.037 --> 00:48:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grew out of the head
of that fourth beast—out of Rome;

00:48:59.874 --> 00:49:04.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that horn had eyes; that horn had a mouth;

00:49:04.337 --> 00:49:07.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that mouth spoke arrogantly.

00:49:07.715 --> 00:49:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this arrogant horn symbolizes

00:49:11.552 --> 00:49:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Anglo-American World Power

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:17.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, the last world power.

00:49:17.475 --> 00:49:21.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was foretold to happen next?

00:49:21.187 --> 00:49:24.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll go to Daniel chapter 7, please.

00:49:24.232 --> 00:49:26.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what happens next.

00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:28.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 7,

00:49:28.402 --> 00:49:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please let’s begin in verse number 26:

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the Court sat,

00:49:34.826 --> 00:49:39.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they took away his rulership
[that is, that horn’s rulership],

00:49:39.664 --> 00:49:44.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to annihilate him
and to destroy him completely.

00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:48.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the kingdom and the rulership
and the grandeur

00:49:48.256 --> 00:49:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the kingdoms under all the heavens

00:49:51.259 --> 00:49:53.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were given to the people

00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:56.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who are the holy ones of the Supreme One.

00:49:56.764 --> 00:50:00.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,

00:50:00.351 --> 00:50:05.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all rulerships will serve and obey them.”

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:09.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rulership of this arrogant horn
is taken away,

00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:11.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is annihilated and destroyed

00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:15.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replaced by God’s Kingdom.

00:50:15.241 --> 00:50:20.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just as described
in the imagery in this vision,

00:50:20.162 --> 00:50:24.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that God’s Kingdom
destroys all human governments

00:50:24.709 --> 00:50:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the time
of the Anglo-American World Power

00:50:28.337 --> 00:50:32.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then takes over rulership of the earth.

00:50:32.258 --> 00:50:35.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How exciting that event,

00:50:35.177 --> 00:50:39.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which will take place
in the near future, will be!

00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:44.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think about it: Every preceding part
of that prophecy has come true.

00:50:44.896 --> 00:50:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have complete confidence, strong faith,

00:50:48.858 --> 00:50:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the final part of it
will also come true.

00:50:53.863 --> 00:50:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are many other prophecies
in the book of Daniel

00:50:57.366 --> 00:50:59.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we didn’t have time to discuss

00:50:59.577 --> 00:51:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have come true in amazing detail.

00:51:03.706 --> 00:51:07.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fulfillment of so many prophecies

00:51:07.335 --> 00:51:09.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
totally convinces us

00:51:09.587 --> 00:51:13.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are deep, deep
in “the time of the end.”

00:51:13.966 --> 00:51:16.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very soon, we’re going to witness

00:51:16.636 --> 00:51:20.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fulfillment of Daniel 12:1,

00:51:20.514 --> 00:51:24.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which talks about ‘Michael the great prince

00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:26.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing up.’

00:51:26.103 --> 00:51:29.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur
a time of [great] distress.”

00:51:29.565 --> 00:51:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s “people will escape,

00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:37.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who is found
written down in the book.”

00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:40.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video near the beginning of this talk,

00:51:40.451 --> 00:51:44.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw Michael, the glorified Jesus Christ,

00:51:44.455 --> 00:51:47.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicted as coming with the angels

00:51:47.959 --> 00:51:50.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rescue Jehovah’s people

00:51:50.294 --> 00:51:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and destroy this wicked system.

00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:56.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, if you notice carefully
in that video,

00:51:56.092 --> 00:52:00.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wicked were actually shooting
their weapons

00:52:00.304 --> 00:52:04.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the sky at Michael.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s laughable
—isn’t it?—

00:52:07.228 --> 00:52:10.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because mankind’s most powerful weapons

00:52:10.106 --> 00:52:12.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are like wet firecrackers

00:52:12.692 --> 00:52:15.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to Michael’s mighty power.

00:52:15.486 --> 00:52:19.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the video,
Michael was depicted as coming

00:52:19.991 --> 00:52:23.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no defensive equipment,
such as a breastplate or shield.

00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:25.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t need it.

00:52:25.663 --> 00:52:28.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was depicted only with a sword

00:52:28.749 --> 00:52:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an offensive weapon.

00:52:30.793 --> 00:52:35.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes in our illustrations,
he’s depicted with a bow and arrow

00:52:35.381 --> 00:52:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, only an offensive weapon.

00:52:38.801 --> 00:52:43.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his offensive weapons are powerful

00:52:43.305 --> 00:52:45.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—much, much more powerful

00:52:45.766 --> 00:52:50.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than needed to do the job
of rescuing Jehovah’s people

00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sweeping out of existence

00:52:52.815 --> 00:52:56.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s entire wicked system.

00:52:56.944 --> 00:52:59.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then after Armageddon,

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glorious Thousand Year Reign

00:53:01.574 --> 00:53:04.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Christ Jesus will begin.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during that marvelous time,

00:53:07.455 --> 00:53:09.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last verse

00:53:09.707 --> 00:53:12.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the book of Daniel will be fulfilled.

00:53:12.877 --> 00:53:14.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s read it.

00:53:14.086 --> 00:53:18.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last verse of this book, chapter 12,

00:53:18.174 --> 00:53:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 13.

00:53:20.676 --> 00:53:23.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s what was said to Daniel:

00:53:23.137 --> 00:53:27.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as for you, go on to the end.

00:53:27.433 --> 00:53:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will rest, but you will stand up

00:53:31.312 --> 00:53:35.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.”

00:53:35.024 --> 00:53:38.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Daniel served Jehovah faithfully

00:53:38.486 --> 00:53:40.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the end of his life.

00:53:40.613 --> 00:53:42.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went “to the end,” didn’t he?

00:53:42.698 --> 00:53:45.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he’s resting in death,

00:53:45.534 --> 00:53:49.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but soon he “will stand up”
in the resurrection

00:53:49.497 --> 00:53:51.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during Christ’s Millennial Reign

00:53:51.499 --> 00:53:56.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for [his] lot”—his place in the new world.

00:53:56.337 --> 00:53:59.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we ask, Did Daniel have faith
in that promise

00:53:59.548 --> 00:54:02.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gave him through the angel?

00:54:02.301 --> 00:54:05.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, he did!

00:54:05.096 --> 00:54:08.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had already demonstrated
faith for decades.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remained clean when tempted to eat food

00:54:11.727 --> 00:54:14.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 that would defile him.

00:54:14.021 --> 00:54:16.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was diligent in prayer,

00:54:16.023 --> 00:54:20.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when praying meant
that he would be executed.

00:54:20.194 --> 00:54:25.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never stopped building his faith
through Bible study.

00:54:25.199 --> 00:54:28.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can be sure
he believed with all his heart

00:54:28.786 --> 00:54:32.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that promise Jehovah gave him
through the angel

00:54:32.081 --> 00:54:34.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that he would stand up in the resurrection

00:54:34.583 --> 00:54:38.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take his place in the new world.

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,

00:54:40.172 --> 00:54:43.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we maintain our faith

00:54:43.425 --> 00:54:45.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Daniel did?

00:54:45.427 --> 00:54:48.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by staying morally
and spiritually clean,

00:54:48.973 --> 00:54:52.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not allowing anything to corrupt our faith;

00:54:52.476 --> 00:54:55.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by praying constantly

00:54:55.062 --> 00:54:59.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with full confidence that Jehovah
will answer our prayers;

00:54:59.859 --> 00:55:02.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by listening to Jehovah

00:55:02.027 --> 00:55:06.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by diligent study of his Word.

00:55:06.073 --> 00:55:09.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to have faith

00:55:09.201 --> 00:55:12.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is our Rewarder.

00:55:12.163 --> 00:55:14.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:6 says:

00:55:14.331 --> 00:55:19.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever approaches God must believe
that he is [that he’s really there]

00:55:19.336 --> 00:55:23.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:55:23.257 --> 00:55:27.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:55:27.136 --> 00:55:31.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about our two brothers
shown earlier in this talk:

00:55:31.265 --> 00:55:35.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christian father and the sick brother.

00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:38.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Christian father ended up behind bars,

00:55:38.564 --> 00:55:42.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our sick brother
was not miraculously healed.

00:55:42.359 --> 00:55:45.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was their faith in vain?

00:55:45.154 --> 00:55:48.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, no!

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jehovah reward them?

00:55:50.576 --> 00:55:53.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, yes!

00:55:53.704 --> 00:55:56.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are facing a similar situation,

00:55:56.999 --> 00:55:59.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will Jehovah reward you?

00:55:59.084 --> 00:56:02.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most definitely yes!

00:56:02.504 --> 00:56:05.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video

00:56:05.424 --> 00:56:08.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which features the song that we will sing

00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:11.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conclude our convention.

00:56:11.222 --> 00:56:12.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy this video.

00:56:34.954 --> 00:56:40.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should I fear the lion?

00:56:42.086 --> 00:56:47.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should I fear any foe?

00:56:47.675 --> 00:56:51.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah by my side,

00:56:51.595 --> 00:56:55.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not run and hide.

00:56:55.015 --> 00:57:00.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My God is with me; this I know.

00:57:00.938 --> 00:57:03.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:57:03.565 --> 00:57:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

00:57:07.945 --> 00:57:10.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:14.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

00:57:15.077 --> 00:57:18.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

00:57:18.956 --> 00:57:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Determined to go on,

00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:28.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

With eyes of faith.

00:57:43.731 --> 00:57:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those faithful ones before us

00:57:50.112 --> 00:57:56.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lived their lives in loyalty.

00:57:56.285 --> 00:58:00.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By their faith they endured.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their future is assured.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll stand again for all to see.

00:58:09.506 --> 00:58:12.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:58:12.176 --> 00:58:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

00:58:16.305 --> 00:58:18.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:58:18.766 --> 00:58:23.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

00:58:23.395 --> 00:58:27.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

00:58:27.066 --> 00:58:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Determined to go on,

00:58:31.195 --> 00:58:36.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith.

00:58:41.121 --> 00:58:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith, I can move a mountain.

00:58:48.045 --> 00:58:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith, my hope is sure.

00:58:55.177 --> 00:58:57.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would I be

00:58:57.429 --> 00:59:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without the faith that helps me see

00:59:01.767 --> 00:59:10.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beyond the trials I endure?

00:59:12.528 --> 00:59:19.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see the wondrous future

00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:24.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has in store for me.

00:59:25.874 --> 00:59:29.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to be strong.

00:59:29.044 --> 00:59:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it won’t be long

00:59:32.214 --> 00:59:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Till Jehovah claims his victory.

00:59:38.637 --> 00:59:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:59:41.223 --> 00:59:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see beyond the darkness.

00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:52.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s nothing more to fear.

00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:56.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah, I am strong,

00:59:56.530 --> 01:00:00.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Determined to go on,

01:00:00.284 --> 01:00:06.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that my God is always near—

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

01:00:23.515 --> 01:00:31.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith.

01:00:34.318 --> 01:00:38.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerfully motivating video!

01:00:38.197 --> 01:00:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we look forward to singing that song

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:45.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conclude our convention.

01:00:45.412 --> 01:00:47.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

01:00:47.748 --> 01:00:49.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithful children,

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cherished interested ones,

01:00:52.294 --> 01:00:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no doubt that right now

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:58.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we face powerful enemies.

01:00:58.926 --> 01:01:02.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, we have a powerful enemy

01:01:02.346 --> 01:01:04.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside our bodies

01:01:04.389 --> 01:01:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—inherited sin.

01:01:06.391 --> 01:01:11.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wages an intense war
against our desire to do what is right.

01:01:12.439 --> 01:01:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Secondly, we have the formidable foes:

01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:19.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan and his demons.

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is described as a devouring lion,

01:01:23.116 --> 01:01:25.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a cunning serpent,

01:01:25.118 --> 01:01:27.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fierce dragon,

01:01:27.204 --> 01:01:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sneaky birdcatcher,

01:01:29.206 --> 01:01:31.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s given other evil descriptions.

Ephesians 6:12 says:

01:01:34.336 --> 01:01:38.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have a struggle
[the footnote, literally “a wrestling”]

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . against the wicked spirit forces
in the heavenly places.”

01:01:43.845 --> 01:01:48.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as mentioned in our publications,
there may be tens of thousands

01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:51.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these powerful, evil spirit creatures

01:01:51.562 --> 01:01:53.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the invisible realm

01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:57.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
waging war against us.

01:01:57.901 --> 01:02:02.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirdly, we have this wicked world
all around us

01:02:02.406 --> 01:02:05.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is trying to assimilate us

01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into joining them in ungodly conduct.

01:02:09.538 --> 01:02:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking at the ratio,

01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:15.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as Jehovah’s people
are outnumbered by people of the world

01:02:15.961 --> 01:02:20.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by about 900 to 1.

01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:25.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite the power
of those three great enemies,

01:02:25.304 --> 01:02:30.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith—this product
of Jehovah’s invincible holy spirit—

01:02:31.059 --> 01:02:36.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes us stronger and stronger individually

01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:40.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than all of those three enemies combined.

01:02:41.361 --> 01:02:43.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the near future,

01:02:43.405 --> 01:02:46.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another powerful enemy will come against us.

01:02:46.742 --> 01:02:49.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This formidable foe

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:54.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a coalition of nations
called Gog in Ezekiel chapter 38.

01:02:54.625 --> 01:02:59.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Ezekiel chapter 38 says
that Gog will come with “a great assembly,

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:01.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vast army.”

01:03:01.715 --> 01:03:04.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Like clouds covering the land,”

01:03:04.301 --> 01:03:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will come against God’s people.

01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:11.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this could be
a very intimidating situation.

01:03:11.558 --> 01:03:13.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But dear brothers and sisters,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your faith will make you stronger than Gog

01:03:18.565 --> 01:03:20.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will keep you strong

01:03:20.859 --> 01:03:24.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until Jehovah miraculously intervenes
at Armageddon.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it,
Armageddon really is a rescue operation.

01:03:28.408 --> 01:03:30.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will intervene,

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:35.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will sweep attacking Gog away forever

01:03:35.248 --> 01:03:39.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a “broom of annihilation.”

01:03:39.294 --> 01:03:43.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, faith has helped God’s people

01:03:43.632 --> 01:03:47.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome the most powerful obstacles,

01:03:47.803 --> 01:03:50.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that same product of holy spirit

01:03:50.764 --> 01:03:52.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us do the same.

01:03:52.974 --> 01:03:57.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, throughout the centuries,
just like today,

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:59.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s servants, such as Daniel,

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:02.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been made powerful,

01:04:02.776 --> 01:04:07.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not by natural strength, but through faith.

01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:10.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So dear brothers and sisters,

01:04:10.492 --> 01:04:12.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithful children,

01:04:12.828 --> 01:04:15.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cherished interested ones,

01:04:15.372 --> 01:04:17.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray earnestly for faith.

01:04:17.874 --> 01:04:21.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put up a hard fight to maintain your faith.

01:04:21.253 --> 01:04:23.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And trust with all your heart

01:04:23.797 --> 01:04:25.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if you have faith,

01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:29.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain your faith, and walk by faith,

01:04:29.136 --> 01:04:31.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you definitely will see

01:04:31.805 --> 01:04:36.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Jehovah’s promises fulfilled.

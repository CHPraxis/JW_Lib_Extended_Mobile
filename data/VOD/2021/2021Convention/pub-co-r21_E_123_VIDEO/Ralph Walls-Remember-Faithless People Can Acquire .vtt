00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:06.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago, a brother in Mexico
from the rurals,

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dressed in very simple country garb,

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knocked at the door of a palatial mansion.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man in a silken bathrobe responded
and asked what he wanted.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Witness said,

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:23.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a mule should come to your door
with two bags of gold,

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you accept it?”

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Annoyed, the householder replied:

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not understand what you’re telling me.

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:34.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am a famous engineer.”

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Witness then asked him,

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you understand about prophecies?”

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man admitted that he did not know
anything about them.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the Witness said:

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:48.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is what I want to speak to you about.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am that mule that came to your door,

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the two bags of gold
are these magazines:

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  and <i>Awake!” </i>

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man was impressed by the presentation
of this humble Witness

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took the two magazines.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that man come into the truth?

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know
is that our humble brother

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave that man an opportunity
for Jehovah to stir his heart.

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century, many prominent Jews
hesitated to follow Jesus

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they feared becoming outcasts.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in the Gospel
of John chapter 12 says:

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many even of the rulers

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“actually put faith in him,

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:39.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they would not acknowledge him
because of the Pharisees,

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they would not be expelled

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the synagogue.”

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, some overcame social pressure

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took a stand for Jesus.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us of “Joseph of Arimathea,

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a reputable member of the Council,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:00.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who . . . took courage
and went in before Pilate

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked for the body of Jesus.”

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the book of Acts reports

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the word of God
continued to spread, . . .

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a large crowd of priests
began to be obedient to the faith.”

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An outstanding example of a prominent one
is Saul of Tarsus,

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who later became the apostle Paul.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a Pharisee

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one who persecuted Jewish Christians.

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He admitted this, saying:

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I persecuted this Way to the point of death,

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
binding and handing over to prisons
both men and women.”

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he changed and became
a zealous preacher

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an apostle.

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:51.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly today, some who had
a high social position in this world

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have become believers.

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Saul acquire faith?

00:02:57.573 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s let Paul tell us.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Acts chapter 22,

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 6 through 8.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 22:6-8,

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as I was traveling

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and getting near to Damascus,
about midday,

00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“suddenly out of heaven a great light

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“flashed all around me,

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I fell to the ground
and heard a voice say to me:

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Saul, Saul,

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:35.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“why are you persecuting me?’

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:39.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I answered: ‘Who are you, Lord?’

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:44.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he said to me: ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene,

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:46.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom you are persecuting.’”

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it was by Jesus

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
miraculously appearing to Saul
and identifying himself.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A shocking event!

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:59.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, Saul completely changed

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:01.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his values and priorities in life.

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:04.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, he was inspired to write something

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reflects
an entirely different viewpoint.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it.

00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in the book of Philippians chapter 3,

00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:17.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what he says in verses 7 and 8:

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:23.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yet, the things that were gains to me,

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:27.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have considered loss
on account of the Christ.

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What is more, I do indeed also consider
all things to be loss

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on account of the excelling value

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:37.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For his sake I have taken
the loss of all things

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:44.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I consider them as a lot of refuse,

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I may gain Christ.”

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that moved Paul
to have such a change?

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:57.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used a startling occasion
to stir Paul’s heart.

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
World events, personal tragedy,

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other changed circumstances,
though not initiated by Jehovah,

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause a person
prominent in this system of things

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:12.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reevaluate his or her life

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:15.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to the good news.

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a person may realize
that high social status

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:22.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not offer a solution to life’s problems.

00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:26.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note how changing circumstances

00:05:26.138 --> 00:05:28.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can affect a person’s thinking.

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.602 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
During my high-school years,

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:35.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would work at a shipyard

00:05:35.147 --> 00:05:37.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a third-class welder.

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult.

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:42.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the summertime,
it was real hot on the water.

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just said: “Wow!

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I’m going to have to do this
for 30 or 40 years,

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to find something better.”

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that period of time, “successful” meant

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:55.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a good job, a lot of money, comfort.”

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:58.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I went through college in four years

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got an accounting degree.

00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:03.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I would get a transfer,
I would get promoted.

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went from Africa to Belgium,

00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:08.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Belgium to Scotland,

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Scotland back to the U.S.,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then from the U.S. to Singapore.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was really a big jump

00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:20.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—nice cars, a driver,

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:22.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting a whole lot of money in the bank.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:26.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And every time
I would reach one of these goals,

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:28.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I would sit at the table and say:

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now—now we’re going to be happy.

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:34.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re going to finally start
to be able to enjoy this.”

00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:37.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was like something fleeting.

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:39.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just wasn’t there.

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:42.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The emptiness was growing bigger.

00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was getting— 
The hole was getting larger.

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:46.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were just perplexed.

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:49.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know where to go
to find any kind of joy or happiness.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, my daughter,

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had a baby shop.

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:58.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sold baby clothes
and small baby furniture.

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She and her husband ran the shop.

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:03.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they hired this young girl

00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with the store
and to help with their children.

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:08.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when she wasn’t busy
with the store and with the children,

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:12.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she’d pull open her Bible
and she would be reading her Bible.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they asked this young girl,

00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know anybody

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:19.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could study with the two kids?”

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “I have the perfect people,
the perfect couple.”

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they set up a study

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:28.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the following week
on one night during the week.

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:33.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my daughter called me and said:
“Dad, can you come to this Bible study?

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:35.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t know these people.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you just need to be there
to make sure it’s on the up-and-up.”

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:42.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I came to that first Bible study,
and I watched it.

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:45.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just sat there amazed!

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:49.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the study was over,
I asked them, I said,

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:51.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would y’all be interested
in studying with me?”

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, in the world,
you may hit these goals,

00:07:57.331 --> 00:08:00.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then very quickly after that,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you go way down
and then you stay way down.

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth brings you constant joy.

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:08.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing like it.

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:10.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just complete satisfaction,

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:13.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just know now
you’re doing the right thing.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s just changed our whole life now
and our whole attitude.

00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:21.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are just so very content and happy.

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:26.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers, we are being encouraged

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give a bold witness to prominent ones.

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:35.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s natural that at times we may feel
intimidated by prominent ones

00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:38.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hesitate to give a witness,

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:41.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let’s be determined to imitate Jesus.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way?

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:48.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Isaiah 11:3 says about him:

00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:54.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will find delight
in the fear of Jehovah.

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:58.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will not judge
by what appears to his eyes,

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:02.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor reprove simply according
to what his ears hear.”

00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:06.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that?

00:09:06.316 --> 00:09:08.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like Jesus,

00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:11.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who does not judge
by what appears to his eyes,

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:14.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not want to predetermine
a person’s response

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:18.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their outward appearance,
their large homes,

00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:20.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their prominence, or their position.

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:24.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also want to imitate the apostle Paul

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:28.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his attitude after he became a Christian.

00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:30.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what he says

00:09:30.298 --> 00:09:34.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Romans chapter 1.

00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:38.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to key in to verse 16.

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:43.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 1:16.

00:09:46.148 --> 00:09:49.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll read
the first part of that verse.

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:51.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:56.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am not ashamed of the good news.”

00:09:57.576 --> 00:10:00.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, under inspiration, he then comments

00:10:00.036 --> 00:10:03.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the effectiveness
of preaching the good news

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he says:

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:09.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It [that is, the good news]

00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is, in fact, God’s power for salvation

00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:15.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to everyone having faith,

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:19.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.”

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:22.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s be determined

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:26.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach boldly to all,

00:10:26.313 --> 00:10:30.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving Jehovah the opportunity
to stir the hearts of those who listen.

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:35.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris of the Governing Body

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:42.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember
—Faithless People Can Acquire Faith!

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nonreligious People.”

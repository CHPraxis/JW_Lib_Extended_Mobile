00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, Jehovah performed miracles

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that strengthened the faith of his servants.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is he performing miracles in our day?

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s listen as Brother David Splane
of the Governing Body

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides the answer in the talk

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s Powerful Works Inspire Faith.”

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a Miracle Worker.

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s a miracle?

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you describe it?

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s give a simple definition.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A miracle is a powerful work

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can’t be explained in human terms.

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:27.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever Jehovah performs a miracle,
he has a purpose.

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:31.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one reason might be
to strengthen the faith of his servants.

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the title of this talk,

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s Powerful Works Inspire Faith.”

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:43.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we love to consider
the miracles recorded in the Bible.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really faith-strengthening, isn’t it?

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during this talk,
we’re going to consider just a few.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about this one?

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:54.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah leads the Israelites out of Egypt.

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrive at the Red Sea,
and it seems they’re trapped.

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sea is ahead of them;
Pharaoh and his armies are behind.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah causes
the waters of the Red Sea to part,

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:09.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Israelites cross over on dry land.

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Pharaoh and his armies follow,

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah brings the sea
back to its normal condition,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cream of the crop
of Egyptian manhood drowns.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know what effect

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that miracle had on the Egyptians,

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what effect
did it have on the Israelites?

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 14:31

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I’ll give you a moment
so you can find that),

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus chapter 14

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 31—it says:

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Israel also saw the great power

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians,

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the people began to fear Jehovah

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to put faith in Jehovah.”

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that miracle

00:02:56.488 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired faith in the Israelites.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they weren’t the only ones
who were impressed by that miracle.

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s fast-forward 40 years.

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two spies enter Jericho and go
to the house of Rahab the prostitute.

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she says to them:

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We heard how Jehovah

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“dried up the waters of the Red Sea . . .

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When we heard about it, we lost heart, . . .

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jehovah your God
is God in the heavens above

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the earth beneath.”

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just hearing about that miracle

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired faith in Rahab.

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another person whose faith was

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthened by a powerful work
might surprise you:

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Queen of Sheba.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Queen of Sheba,
what was the powerful work?

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outstanding wisdom.

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:49.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d heard about the wisdom of Solomon,

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her curiosity got the better of her.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She just had to see if the report was true.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that involved a 1,200-mile trip

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:04.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from her country to Jerusalem.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The trip turned out
to be well worth the effort.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the visit,
the Queen of Sheba said to Solomon:

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May Jehovah your God be praised,
who has taken pleasure in you 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by putting you on the throne of Israel.”

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave credit to Jehovah for what she saw.

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t know if she ever
became a worshipper of Jehovah,

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jesus said
that she’d ‘rise up in the judgment’

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “condemn” those Jews

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wouldn’t even cross the street
to listen to the Son of God.

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:38.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are just two examples

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:41.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as you know,
there are many more in the Bible.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul lists some of them

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews chapter 11,

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 32 to 34,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 11 (I’ll give you a moment),

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 32-34.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m going to read verse 32 first,

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:09.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:32 (have you got it?):

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And what more will I say?

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:15.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For time will fail me
if I go on to relate about Gideon,

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Barak, Samson, Jephthah,

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:23.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David, as well as Samuel
and the other prophets.”

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as I read verses 33 and 34,

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:30.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you children

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at the events
that are being described

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can guess who was involved.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:41.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was the object of this miracle?

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s read verse 33;

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Through faith

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they defeated kingdoms,

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brought about righteousness,
obtained promises,

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stopped the mouths of lions,

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“quenched the force of fire,

00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:01.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“escaped the edge of the sword,

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:04.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from a weak state were made powerful,

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became mighty in war,
routed invading armies.”

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:13.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go back and see
if we can identify individuals

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were involved in those miracles.

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about “defeated kingdoms”?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you come up with someone?

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:22.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about Gideon.

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we like Gideon.

00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminds us of us.

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t exactly brimming with confidence.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an angel approached him

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:34.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and indicated that Jehovah
had work for him to do,

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon said:
“My clan is the least in Manasseh,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am the most insignificant
in my father’s house.”

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said something else,

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:49.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that has a bearing
on the theme of our discussion.

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:53.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to the angel:
“If Jehovah is with us, . . .

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:58.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where are all his wonderful acts
that our fathers related to us?”

00:06:58.272 --> 00:07:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, where were the powerful works?

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:04.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before he was going to stick his neck out,

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon wanted some kind of reassurance
that he had Jehovah’s blessing.

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What to do?

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the angel going to do?

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He performed a powerful work,

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:19.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that inspired faith in Gideon.

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:23.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Gideon’s confidence
was further boosted

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by three other remarkable signs

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:28.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—two involving a fleece

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:31.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and another involving a God-given dream.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with those powerful works
in mind and with Jehovah’s help,

00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon did the impossible.

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With 300 men,

00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:45.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he defeated an army of 135,000.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:47.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what’s the takeaway?

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:49.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah on our side,

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:55.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are never outnumbered.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to verse 33.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you children,
I’m sure you’re going to get this next one,

00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:02.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 33:

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:06.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stopped the mouths of lions.”

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:08.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who did that?

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:13.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was the same one
who helped Gideon defeat the Midianites.

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:14.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah.

00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:16.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was the circumstance?

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:17.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know.

00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:21.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was when Daniel
was thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when Daniel was condemned to die,

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:27.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t know for sure
that Jehovah was going to rescue him.

00:08:27.652 --> 00:08:31.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he knew that Jehovah
would do the right thing.

00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:33.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have that confidence because Jehovah

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been with him throughout his life.

00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:40.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:44.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wait a minute; let’s think about that.

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:49.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:51.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was that?

00:08:51.468 --> 00:08:54.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was when
the king of Babylon had a dream,

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he decreed that unless Daniel

00:08:56.181 --> 00:08:59.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other wise men of Babylon
could tell him what he dreamed

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:02.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then relate the meaning of the dream,

00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:04.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would all be put to death.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That called for a powerful work.

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided Daniel
with the information he needed,

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:15.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Daniel’s life was saved.

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:17.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was Babylon.

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:19.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re in Persia, and Daniel

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:24.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is once more facing death—death by a lion.

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:28.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once again, Jehovah comes to the rescue.

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:33.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He temporarily shuts
the mouths of those lions.

00:09:33.093 --> 00:09:36.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can imagine
what effect that had on Daniel.

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:37.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about us today?

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:39.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the takeaway?
What’s the lesson?

00:09:40.517 --> 00:09:43.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Satan

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:47.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “[walking] about like a roaring lion,
seeking to devour someone.”

00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:52.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may never know how often
Jehovah shuts the mouth of that lion

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:55.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how often Jehovah protects his people

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a group from Satan.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:00.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re working from door to door,
for example.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s dangerous out there!

00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:04.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we probably have no idea

00:10:04.332 --> 00:10:07.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how busy the angels are in our behalf.

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if someone does lose his life

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:12.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while in Jehovah’s service or at a meeting

00:10:12.924 --> 00:10:14.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and it has happened—

00:10:14.926 --> 00:10:17.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his loved ones can be sure of two things.

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,

00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their loved one did not
lose Jehovah’s approval.

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:27.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, the loss is only temporary.

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:31.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan can never do us any lasting harm.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day Jehovah will shut

00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:37.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lion’s mouth permanently.

00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:40.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, back to Hebrews 11,

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:42.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this time we’re reading verse 34,

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:45.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you kids
are going to guess this one,

00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:47.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 34:

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:50.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“quenched the force of fire.”

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:51.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:55.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:10:55.258 --> 00:10:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were court officials in Babylon.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll recall that one day,
King Nebuchadnezzar

00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:04.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a huge image of gold
and demanded that everybody worship it.

00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:09.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyone who refused would be thrown
into the burning fiery furnace.

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:14.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was a time to remember
Jehovah’s powerful works of the past.

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:17.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the three men had experienced that,

00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:20.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably when they were just teenagers.

00:11:20.492 --> 00:11:22.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of how?

00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:25.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they arrived in Babylon,

00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:27.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were taken to the palace
for special training,

00:11:27.832 --> 00:11:30.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were told to eat whatever
was put in front of them.

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case, some of the food
was prohibited under the Mosaic Law.

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:38.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:11:38.385 --> 00:11:40.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refused to eat those foods,

00:11:40.804 --> 00:11:44.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they asked to be given
vegetables and water instead.

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for some of you children,

00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:49.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the thought of having
to eat vegetables all the time

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is probably quite a test.

00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:55.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, think of the results of this diet.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After only 10 days,

00:11:57.362 --> 00:11:59.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the three young men
were in much better health

00:11:59.864 --> 00:12:02.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than those who had followed the king’s diet.

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:04.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’ve ever had to follow a diet,

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that there’s no way
that you can show improvement

00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:09.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just 10 days.

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:12.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had to have been involved.

00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:15.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they were facing death.

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:18.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew their God.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew what he was capable of.

00:12:21.303 --> 00:12:25.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told the king that if it
was the will of God, they would be rescued,

00:12:25.599 --> 00:12:30.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if not, they still wouldn’t worship
the image of gold.

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:35.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew that if Jehovah
chose not to intervene miraculously,

00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:39.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was not a sign of his disapproval.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know what happened.

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:44.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were thrown into the fiery furnace,

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:48.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God sent his angel to protect them.

00:12:48.163 --> 00:12:50.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they stepped out of the furnace,

00:12:50.415 --> 00:12:53.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there wasn’t even the smell of fire on them.

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:57.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their integrity also resulted
in a great witness.

00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:00.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the king saw
that they were alive and well, 

00:13:00.258 --> 00:13:03.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he praised Jehovah; he said:
“Praised be the God of Shadrach,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meshach, and Abednego . . .

00:13:05.722 --> 00:13:09.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no other god who is able to rescue

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this one.”

00:13:11.102 --> 00:13:13.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a witness that gave!

00:13:13.855 --> 00:13:16.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what happened back then.

00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:19.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the takeaway?
What’s the lesson?

00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:23.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many brothers are facing

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:27.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heat of adversity—Russia, for example.

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:30.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many brothers
have been given long prison sentences

00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:34.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they won’t bow down to the state.

00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah doesn’t prevent
this from happening 

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:40.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any more than he prevented
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:42.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from being thrown into the furnace.

00:13:42.342 --> 00:13:44.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he does help them.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:48.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we notice about them
as they’re being led off to prison?

00:13:48.056 --> 00:13:50.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re smiling.

00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:51.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re serene.

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:53.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re at peace.

00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:55.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They know their God.

00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:59.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they come out, there won’t
even be the smell of fire on them.

00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith will be intact.

00:14:02.612 --> 00:14:06.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their fine conduct also results
in a good witness to the jailers

00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:09.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others who hear about the persecution.

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:12.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll take one more example
in verse 34:

00:14:12.747 --> 00:14:16.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“escaped the edge of the sword.”

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:18.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking of Elisha.

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:21.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the days of the prophet Elisha,

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:24.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of Syria went to war against Israel,

00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:26.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he called a war council,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Syrians
secretly planned their strategy.

00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:34.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah kept telling Elisha
what the Syrians were up to,

00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:37.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Elisha kept telling the king of Israel.

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Syrians were furious,

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:44.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the king sent a large army
to capture Elisha.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What ingratitude!

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

00:14:48.324 --> 00:14:51.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because in the previous chapter,
we read that Elisha

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:53.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had cured the leprosy of Naaman,

00:14:53.204 --> 00:14:55.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a chief of the Syrian army, and now

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:59.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large Syrian army was hunting Elisha down.

00:14:59.627 --> 00:15:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope Naaman wasn’t among them.

00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:05.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the Syrians found

00:15:05.675 --> 00:15:08.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the city where Elisha was,
and they surrounded it.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha’s attendant was scared to death,

00:15:11.806 --> 00:15:13.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Elisha wasn’t afraid.

00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:16.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Kings chapter 6,

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 16, 17 explains why.

00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:21.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is encouraging—faith-strengthening.

00:15:21.858 --> 00:15:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look it up—2 Kings chapter 6,

00:15:25.695 --> 00:15:28.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 16, 17.

00:15:28.782 --> 00:15:32.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is Elisha talking to his attendant:

00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:34.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid!

00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:36.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For there are more who are with us

00:15:36.956 --> 00:15:39.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than those who are with them.’

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:42.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Elisha began to pray and say:

00:15:42.962 --> 00:15:47.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Jehovah, open his eyes,
please, that he may see.’

00:15:47.801 --> 00:15:52.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately Jehovah opened
the attendant’s eyes and he saw,

00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:55.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and look! the mountainous region

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was full of horses and war chariots of fire

00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all around Elisha.”

00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was a miraculous occurrence.

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:07.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was faith-strengthening indeed.

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:09.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the takeaway?

00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one day we’ll be faced

00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:17.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with hosts of modern-day Syrians.

00:16:17.455 --> 00:16:22.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to help us
to remain calm, unafraid?

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll look heavenward
and with our eyes of faith,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:30.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see myriads
of angels encamped all around us.

00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:33.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah will do the right thing,

00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:36.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever is in harmony with his will.

00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hear you say: “I’d like to see a miracle.

00:16:41.729 --> 00:16:44.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would help a lot
to strengthen my faith.”

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:47.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see miracles every day.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s a miracle?

00:16:49.112 --> 00:16:53.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a powerful work
that can’t be explained in human terms.

00:16:54.075 --> 00:16:57.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A modern example of that is prayer.

00:16:57.245 --> 00:16:59.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t prayer amazing?

00:16:59.247 --> 00:17:01.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain it?

00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:03.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can listen to millions

00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of prayers in any language all at once.

00:17:05.962 --> 00:17:08.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a miracle!

00:17:08.673 --> 00:17:11.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does prayer build our faith?

00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:15.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray about a problem
that nobody but Jehovah knows about

00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:20.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our prayer is answered,
our faith is strengthened.

00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:22.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is powerful.

00:17:22.854 --> 00:17:25.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about all the experiences we hear

00:17:25.231 --> 00:17:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when someone desperately prayed to God:

00:17:27.483 --> 00:17:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you exist, please send someone
to teach me about you”

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:36.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ten minutes later,
a Witness knocks on the door?

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coincidence or a miracle?

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another miracle: our Christian brotherhood
—isn’t it remarkable?

00:17:46.753 --> 00:17:48.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who can explain it?

00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:51.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Former enemies become fast friends.

00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:54.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can go to a Kingdom Hall
anywhere in the world

00:17:54.135 --> 00:17:56.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will find your brothers and sisters.

00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:59.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll be glad to see you.
You’ll feel at ease.

00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll know what they believe and what
they’ll be studying at the meetings.

00:18:04.103 --> 00:18:07.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see and feel the love.

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:11.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In times of ethnic cleansing,

00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:15.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how often do we read
of brothers and sisters who risk their lives

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:18.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hide fellow believers who happen
to be from another tribe?

00:18:19.327 --> 00:18:22.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when I think
of a loving brotherhood,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always think of the experience
Jack Johansson related in his life story.

00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:31.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Johansson
was a missionary serving in Malawi

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:34.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when the country was experiencing

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:38.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tremendous political unrest and violence.

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:40.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he and a young African brother
set out to check on

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the welfare of Witnesses
in another part of the country.

00:18:44.852 --> 00:18:49.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But along the way, they encountered
a soldier who wasn’t friendly.

00:18:49.524 --> 00:18:54.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to the African brother,
“I have to shoot the white man.”

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:56.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was serious.

00:18:56.531 --> 00:18:58.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he raised his gun to fire,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the young African brother thrust himself

00:19:01.202 --> 00:19:03.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the gunman
and Brother Johansson and said:

00:19:03.496 --> 00:19:06.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shoot me!
Shoot me, instead!”

00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:10.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that soldier was so touched
by the love of our young African brother,

00:19:10.962 --> 00:19:13.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he put his gun down.

00:19:14.424 --> 00:19:16.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hear experiences like that,

00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:20.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes you proud
to be part of Jehovah’s organization.

00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it that Jehovah
is gathering us into an organization?

00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:27.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s an interesting detail recorded

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 43:10.

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:31.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to look it up.

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you hear Isaiah 43:10,
you say: “I know that.

00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:38.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about ‘“You are my witnesses,”
says Jehovah.’”

00:19:38.573 --> 00:19:39.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s true.

00:19:39.574 --> 00:19:42.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re going to focus
on another part of the verse.

00:19:42.201 --> 00:19:45.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Isaiah 43:10:

00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:49.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah,

00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:52.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes, my servant whom I have chosen,

00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:56.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[now notice this] so that you may know

00:19:56.174 --> 00:19:59.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith in me.’”

00:19:59.844 --> 00:20:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we can have faith in Jehovah,

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:04.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to get to know him.

00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:07.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to learn about his powerful works,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those past and those present.

00:20:10.229 --> 00:20:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we study his dealings
with his people in the past,

00:20:13.107 --> 00:20:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Jehovah
always keeps his promises.

00:20:16.986 --> 00:20:19.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s promised to bring
about a righteous new world.

00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:22.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can take that promise to the bank.

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And through prayer and association
with his organization,

00:20:26.537 --> 00:20:30.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can experience the modern-day miracles

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is performing.

00:20:34.212 --> 00:20:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we know about Jehovah,
the more we’ll love him.

00:20:38.174 --> 00:20:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we love him,
the more we’ll want to tell others about him.

00:20:42.678 --> 00:20:46.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we preach,
the stronger our faith will become,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be made powerful by faith.

00:20:53.064 --> 00:20:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane,
for that thrilling review

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s powerful works.

00:20:59.821 --> 00:21:03.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, we read of those
who showed faith

00:21:03.032 --> 00:21:05.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while their contemporaries did not.

00:21:05.535 --> 00:21:07.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why the difference?

00:21:07.411 --> 00:21:10.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn from those
who showed faith?

00:21:10.623 --> 00:21:15.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take note of the lessons
in the upcoming five-part symposium.

00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:18.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will introduce
the one to follow.

00:21:18.422 --> 00:21:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Turner,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:23.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will deliver the first talk entitled

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless

00:21:27.181 --> 00:21:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Abel, Not Cain.”

00:21:36.107 --> 00:21:38.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As humans,

00:21:38.109 --> 00:21:42.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are designed with the ability
to imitate what we see and hear.

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:44.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:21:44.574 --> 00:21:48.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn to talk by imitating
the language and accent of our parents.

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:50.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we grew up,

00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:55.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we probably also adopted the attitudes
and actions of people we associated with.

00:21:56.419 --> 00:22:01.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the example of others
can have a powerful influence on us.

00:22:02.758 --> 00:22:04.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, more than ever,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to copy good examples of faith.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:22:09.932 --> 00:22:14.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we are living in a time
when our faith will be tested in many ways.

00:22:14.937 --> 00:22:17.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But note what we will have to do.

00:22:17.481 --> 00:22:20.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you, please, 
to turn with me to the book of Jude,

00:22:22.028 --> 00:22:25.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow along as we read

00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:27.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 20 in the book of Jude.

00:22:30.661 --> 00:22:33.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But you, beloved ones,

00:22:33.748 --> 00:22:36.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“build yourselves up on your most holy faith,

00:22:36.876 --> 00:22:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pray with holy spirit.”

00:22:40.922 --> 00:22:43.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help understand this verse,

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:45.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of what a homeowner might do

00:22:45.468 --> 00:22:48.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he knows
a really bad storm is approaching.

00:22:48.888 --> 00:22:53.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, he will take steps to build up, 
or strengthen, his home

00:22:53.893 --> 00:22:57.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from repairing cracks in the foundation

00:22:57.146 --> 00:23:00.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reinforcing the doors, walls, and windows.

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:03.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar manner,

00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:08.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and I must take steps to build up,
or strengthen, our faith

00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:12.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can protect ourselves
against the onslaught of tests

00:23:12.787 --> 00:23:15.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trials we are likely to face.

00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:17.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice, Jude said that we must

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue ‘building ourselves up
on our most holy faith,’

00:23:22.755 --> 00:23:26.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are the Christian teachings
found in God’s Word.

00:23:26.217 --> 00:23:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we study God’s Word
and pray for his help,

00:23:30.346 --> 00:23:33.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can gain strength
by learning from the examples set

00:23:33.975 --> 00:23:36.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by different Bible characters.

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:41.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is so much that can be learned
from the examples of those in ancient times.

00:23:41.774 --> 00:23:45.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each talk of this symposium
will highlight ways

00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:49.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can imitate the faith
of Jehovah’s loyal servants of the past

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:53.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reject the course of faithless ones.

00:23:54.704 --> 00:23:58.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by examining the example of Abel.

00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:03.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was one of the first humans, 
the fourth, in fact, to exist on earth.

00:24:04.672 --> 00:24:07.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes Abel as a righteous man.

00:24:07.842 --> 00:24:12.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He built up a record 
of living according to Jehovah’s standards,

00:24:12.847 --> 00:24:16.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his family, however, did not.

00:24:16.267 --> 00:24:19.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are well familiar with his parents,
 Adam and Eve.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They both rebelled against Jehovah.

00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:26.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his older brother, Cain,
well, he was not a positive role model.

00:24:26.027 --> 00:24:30.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible described Cain 
as one whose “own works were wicked.”

00:24:31.782 --> 00:24:33.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you think about that:

00:24:33.784 --> 00:24:38.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at Adam, Eve, and Cain,

00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:42.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who all displayed a lack of faith in Jehovah,

00:24:42.043 --> 00:24:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you imagine what that family dynamic

00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:48.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have been like for faithful Abel?

00:24:48.257 --> 00:24:51.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tension, hostility,

00:24:51.302 --> 00:24:55.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resentment, lack of spiritual discussions

00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:57.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—do you think Abel’s faith was tested?

00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:59.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, it was.

00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:04.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, our faith may
likewise be tested by the actions

00:25:04.023 --> 00:25:06.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who choose not to serve Jehovah.

00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:11.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you 
to watch the following reenactment.

00:25:11.572 --> 00:25:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you do, 
note how a sister’s faith is tested.

00:25:19.246 --> 00:25:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I arrived in a new city
during the rainy season.

00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:25.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It rained all day every day
for a whole month.

00:25:25.252 --> 00:25:28.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
there were only three publishers there.

00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:31.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first sister I met
was my new pioneer partner.

00:25:31.842 --> 00:25:35.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first,
I felt as if the people in this territory

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:37.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoke a different language.

00:25:37.306 --> 00:25:41.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I tried to talk to some people
about the Bible, they did not like it

00:25:41.435 --> 00:25:44.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some were even afraid of these new ideas.

00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:48.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When government officials

00:25:48.025 --> 00:25:50.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
noticed that we had shared
some tracts with the people,

00:25:50.611 --> 00:25:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began to watch us
and followed us for about three months.

00:25:54.657 --> 00:25:58.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt overwhelmed by all of this
and became very anxious.

00:25:59.453 --> 00:26:03.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had few return visits
or opportunities to speak about Jehovah.

00:26:03.332 --> 00:26:05.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt lost.

00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:07.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do or where to go.

00:26:07.962 --> 00:26:11.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often wondered,
‘Father, why did you send me here?’

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like I had gone
from being on a mountain peak

00:26:15.803 --> 00:26:18.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the bottom of a deep valley.

00:26:19.765 --> 00:26:22.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our sister adjusted
to her new circumstances,

00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:26.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you note how her trials made her feel?

00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:31.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anxious, lost, and overwhelmed.

00:26:31.277 --> 00:26:33.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve experienced similar feelings

00:26:33.696 --> 00:26:36.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when dealing with tests of your faith.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can Abel’s 
example of faith help you and me?

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s notice what he did.

00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:45.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hebrews,

00:26:48.377 --> 00:26:52.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read Hebrews chapter 11

00:26:52.256 --> 00:26:54.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 4.

00:26:57.094 --> 00:26:59.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:

00:26:59.096 --> 00:27:02.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Abel offered God

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:04.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a sacrifice of greater worth
 than that of Cain,

00:27:04.977 --> 00:27:06.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through that faith

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he received the witness
 that he was righteous,

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:14.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for God approved his gifts, 
and although he died,

00:27:14.862 --> 00:27:18.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he still speaks through his faith.”

00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:22.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel built strong faith in Jehovah,

00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:26.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though those around him failed to do so.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three steps that he took.

00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:32.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First:

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:36.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel took time to ponder spiritual matters.

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:38.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,

00:27:38.636 --> 00:27:43.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he no doubt discerned
Jehovah’s love and wisdom in creation.

00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:47.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a shepherd, perhaps he looked 
at his sheep and recognized

00:27:47.186 --> 00:27:50.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they needed someone
to guide and protect them.

00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:53.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Abel likely discerned that as humans,

00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:56.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too need someone to guide and protect us

00:27:56.195 --> 00:28:00.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—someone far wiser
and more powerful than any human.

00:28:02.451 --> 00:28:04.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second step:

00:28:04.537 --> 00:28:09.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel prayed and acted on what he learned.

00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:12.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though his knowledge was limited,

00:28:12.086 --> 00:28:16.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was enough
—enough for him to act in faith.

00:28:18.092 --> 00:28:22.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt Abel appealed to Jehovah
in prayer to accept his sacrifice,

00:28:22.513 --> 00:28:25.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah approved his gift.

00:28:25.474 --> 00:28:28.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel demonstrated his faith so powerfully.

00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:30.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note in verse 4, it tells us

00:28:30.187 --> 00:28:34.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his example still “speaks” to us today?

00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:40.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, we may feel that we
don’t have enough knowledge or experience

00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:42.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to demonstrate faith like Abel.

00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:44.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s OK.

00:28:44.243 --> 00:28:46.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t have to be an obstacle.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah, and make the most
of the knowledge that you do have.

00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:55.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Act in faith, and Jehovah will help you.

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third step:

00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:03.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel remained steadfast when under trial.

00:29:03.637 --> 00:29:07.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t let the actions
of his family affect his faith,

00:29:07.516 --> 00:29:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can’t let the actions
of others affect ours.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must never allow something 
that another person says or does

00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:19.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make us feel ashamed
of being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:29:19.236 --> 00:29:21.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be ready.

00:29:21.238 --> 00:29:24.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be quick to identify yourself
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help to build and fortify your faith.

00:29:29.663 --> 00:29:34.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also learn
from the bad example set by Cain.

00:29:34.084 --> 00:29:36.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Genesis 4:6, 7,

00:29:36.712 --> 00:29:39.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah warns Cain about his attitude,

00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:42.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he urges him to turn to doing good.

00:29:42.926 --> 00:29:45.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just like his faithless parents,

00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cain determined that he 
knew what was best for himself,

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:53.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his actions
led to the murder of his brother.

00:29:54.563 --> 00:29:58.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may go through situations where, 
because of imperfection,

00:29:58.484 --> 00:30:01.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t always use the best judgment

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:04.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it causes us
to develop a negative attitude.

00:30:05.824 --> 00:30:09.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the matter
is brought to our attention,

00:30:09.078 --> 00:30:11.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will we respond?

00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:15.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, let’s not imitate
the faithless example of Cain.

00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:19.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s not feel
that we always know what’s best.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:24.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s see that warning
as a loving tap on the shoulder

00:30:24.218 --> 00:30:26.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our heavenly Father

00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:30.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow it to readjust our thinking
so that we can build our faith

00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:33.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and preserve our relationship with him.

00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s now go back to our sister.

00:30:37.773 --> 00:30:42.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following reenactment,
note how she imitates Abel’s faith.

00:30:45.364 --> 00:30:47.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I studied the Bible

00:30:47.408 --> 00:30:50.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah
cared for his servants in the past.

00:30:50.077 --> 00:30:52.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:30:52.162 --> 00:30:54.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read how Jehovah
told Jacob throughout his life:

00:30:54.915 --> 00:30:57.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will be with you wherever you go.’

00:30:57.918 --> 00:31:01.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pictured Jehovah
telling me the same thing:

00:31:01.296 --> 00:31:02.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry.

00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:06.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just go,
and I will always be there to help you.’

00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:08.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged him to help me

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:11.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be balanced, to feel peace,
and to have courage

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:13.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go out in the ministry.

00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:18.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Jehovah helped me 
to find a very good Bible student.

00:31:18.313 --> 00:31:22.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an absolutely wonderful
and unexpected gift from Jehovah.

00:31:22.568 --> 00:31:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our small group joins
congregation meetings through the Internet.

00:31:26.155 --> 00:31:29.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This arrangement is a valuable source
of spiritual food for me.

00:31:30.492 --> 00:31:33.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get together for meals
and association as well.

00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:37.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The experiences on JW Broadcasting®

00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:39.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make me feel that I am not alone.

00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:42.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I always smile
and wave goodbye at the end.

00:31:42.254 --> 00:31:44.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderful to be here.

00:31:48.051 --> 00:31:51.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how our sister
built up her faith in Jehovah?

00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:55.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She imitated Abel’s example, 
and she followed those steps.

00:31:55.893 --> 00:31:59.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first step: 
She pondered on spiritual matters.

00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:03.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She studied the Bible to see how Jehovah
cared for his servants in the past,

00:32:03.692 --> 00:32:07.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then she applied
what she learned to her situation.

00:32:08.489 --> 00:32:10.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, the second step:

00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:14.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She prayed and acted on what she learned.

00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:19.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her prayer was that Jehovah help her
to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:32:19.416 --> 00:32:23.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have courage to go into the ministry.

00:32:23.128 --> 00:32:25.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she acted in faith.

00:32:25.923 --> 00:32:29.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite the challenges in the ministry,

00:32:29.301 --> 00:32:31.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took the third step:

00:32:31.386 --> 00:32:35.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She remained steadfast under trial.

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She persevered and was blessed with a study.

00:32:37.726 --> 00:32:42.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she reinforced her faith
by joining in congregation meetings

00:32:42.189 --> 00:32:45.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and benefiting from the wholesome
association of the brotherhood.

00:32:46.735 --> 00:32:48.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result?

00:32:48.862 --> 00:32:51.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed her efforts.

00:32:51.573 --> 00:32:54.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you and I follow these steps,

00:32:54.243 --> 00:32:57.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will bless our efforts as well.

00:32:57.162 --> 00:33:00.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By utilizing this tremendous gift
Jehovah has given us

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:05.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the power of example—
you and I can imitate Abel.

00:33:05.879 --> 00:33:08.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we build and fortify our faith,

00:33:08.757 --> 00:33:13.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will weather any storm of adversity
that comes our way.

00:33:15.055 --> 00:33:18.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gary Breaux, 
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:33:21.812 --> 00:33:26.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless
—Enoch, Not Lamech.”

00:33:34.199 --> 00:33:37.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without warning, our faith
could suddenly be tested

00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:41.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by how we react in a violent encounter.

00:33:41.206 --> 00:33:45.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our faith may be tested as Enoch’s was.

00:33:46.545 --> 00:33:50.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ungodliness and violence
were commonplace before the Flood,

00:33:50.966 --> 00:33:55.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Scriptures clearly indicate
how people reacted.

00:33:55.095 --> 00:34:00.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are told that the faithful man Enoch
chose to walk with God.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he was threatened,

00:34:02.394 --> 00:34:05.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he looked to Jehovah for security.

00:34:05.814 --> 00:34:09.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, Lamech,
a descendant of the murderer Cain,

00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opted to provide his own security.

00:34:13.196 --> 00:34:17.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This led to killing a man
in supposed self-defense.

00:34:17.534 --> 00:34:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Enoch and the killer Lamech

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:23.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both lived in a violent world,

00:34:23.165 --> 00:34:27.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their violence-reaction plans

00:34:27.044 --> 00:34:29.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were totally different.

00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:32.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we descend deeper into the last days,

00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:34.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people will become more desperate

00:34:34.927 --> 00:34:37.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and violence will only escalate.

00:34:38.722 --> 00:34:40.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:43.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see how reacting to violence

00:34:43.268 --> 00:34:47.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could suddenly become
a personal test of faith in Jehovah.

00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son barely escaped the gangs

00:35:31.274 --> 00:35:33.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again.

00:35:37.781 --> 00:35:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re the only ones without a gun.

00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:46.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to keep a gun for protection.

00:35:47.457 --> 00:35:51.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how else can I protect my family?

00:35:53.296 --> 00:35:55.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In today’s violent society,

00:35:55.841 --> 00:35:59.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the perceived safest
of neighborhoods,

00:35:59.928 --> 00:36:02.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could have a similar experience.

00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:05.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, how can we imitate Enoch’s faith?

00:36:06.893 --> 00:36:11.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, he recognized
a simple but fundamental truth:

00:36:11.898 --> 00:36:15.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hates violence.

00:36:15.861 --> 00:36:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for us to walk with God as Enoch did,

00:36:19.322 --> 00:36:23.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must reject violence as an option.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us to do that?

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t harbor retaliatory thoughts.

00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:32.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violent thoughts can lead to violent actions,

00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:35.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without thinking about the consequences.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn to recognize situations
that could harm us;

00:36:40.218 --> 00:36:42.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then act to avoid the danger.

00:36:42.929 --> 00:36:47.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the counsel given at Proverbs 22:3:

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself,

00:36:54.608 --> 00:36:59.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the inexperienced keep right on going
and suffer the consequences.”

00:37:00.447 --> 00:37:05.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re encouraged to conceal ourselves
if we sense danger.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think ahead, look around, be perceptive,

00:37:09.081 --> 00:37:13.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid situations that may become violent.

00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:17.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid violent entertainment.

00:37:17.255 --> 00:37:18.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:37:18.924 --> 00:37:22.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It frequently portrays a violent response

00:37:22.844 --> 00:37:25.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a character’s safety is threatened.

00:37:25.764 --> 00:37:28.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All sorts of objects or weapons

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are depicted as strategies

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to kill or overpower the opponents.

00:37:35.315 --> 00:37:38.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While Christians may take reasonable steps

00:37:38.276 --> 00:37:41.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ensure their personal security,

00:37:41.113 --> 00:37:45.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they do so within the framework
of Bible principles.

00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:49.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider these three scriptures
as you make decisions

00:37:49.454 --> 00:37:52.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about your family’s security needs.

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:57.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David prayed at Psalm 51:14:

00:37:57.087 --> 00:37:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Save me from bloodguilt.”

00:38:00.632 --> 00:38:04.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never wanted to be guilty of murder.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparing a response
that includes the use of weapons

00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:10.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could result in taking a life.

00:38:10.851 --> 00:38:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a Christian takes reasonable steps

00:38:13.436 --> 00:38:16.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend himself or his property,

00:38:16.148 --> 00:38:18.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would do everything in his power

00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid taking a human life
and become bloodguilty.

00:38:25.574 --> 00:38:28.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 26:52, Jesus warned

00:38:28.827 --> 00:38:31.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘those who draw the sword

00:38:31.705 --> 00:38:34.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shall die by the sword.’

00:38:34.249 --> 00:38:37.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s well-established
that when weapons are displayed,

00:38:37.294 --> 00:38:42.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
situations usually escalate
with tragic outcomes.

00:38:43.842 --> 00:38:46.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Planning to use a deadly weapon

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:50.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could effectively dismiss Jehovah’s spirit
from our presence.

00:38:50.473 --> 00:38:54.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To pull away from Jehovah
is the last thing we want to do

00:38:54.936 --> 00:38:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a dangerous situation.

00:38:58.523 --> 00:39:03.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third is found at Ecclesiastes 9:18,
where it simply says:

00:39:03.236 --> 00:39:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wisdom is better than weapons.”

00:39:06.656 --> 00:39:09.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, being armed

00:39:09.326 --> 00:39:12.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot match wisdom.

00:39:12.078 --> 00:39:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prudent course is to trust in Jehovah,

00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:18.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not weapons.

00:39:18.126 --> 00:39:20.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word wisely teaches us

00:39:20.754 --> 00:39:24.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to daily show respect, consideration,

00:39:24.007 --> 00:39:26.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and genuine kindness to others.

00:39:26.927 --> 00:39:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This approach of pursuing peace

00:39:29.804 --> 00:39:34.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will often minimize
otherwise potential conflicts.

00:39:34.184 --> 00:39:37.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true, violent struggles often begin

00:39:37.896 --> 00:39:40.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a heated exchange of words?

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:44.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So calmness can often defuse anger

00:39:44.527 --> 00:39:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deflect violent conflicts.

00:39:48.698 --> 00:39:50.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s something else to consider.

00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:53.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible book of Jude

00:39:53.912 --> 00:39:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that Enoch prophesied to his opposers.

00:39:57.874 --> 00:40:00.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that he was a preacher.

00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:03.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being known
as a courageous Witness of Jehovah

00:40:03.755 --> 00:40:07.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing compassion
for those to whom we preach

00:40:07.175 --> 00:40:10.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always our best protection.

00:40:11.638 --> 00:40:16.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was Enoch rewarded
for putting his faith in Jehovah?

00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:20.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note the answer at Hebrews 11:5:

00:40:24.567 --> 00:40:29.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Enoch was transferred
so as not to see death,

00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:33.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he was nowhere to be found
because God had transferred him;

00:40:33.702 --> 00:40:37.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for before he was transferred
he received the witness

00:40:37.664 --> 00:40:40.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had pleased God well.”

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch was rewarded with the knowledge
that “he had pleased God well.”

00:40:46.965 --> 00:40:50.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some manner, in a very clear way,

00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:53.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was given assurance of Jehovah’s approval.

00:40:53.888 --> 00:40:55.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting to know

00:40:55.974 --> 00:41:00.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we face dangerous encounters
with no good way out,

00:41:00.645 --> 00:41:05.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Enoch, we too can handle
that test of faith

00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:08.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that will please God well!

00:41:09.362 --> 00:41:11.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:15.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how our brother
imitates Enoch’s example.

00:41:18.538 --> 00:41:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:1:

00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:25.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for.”

00:41:25.962 --> 00:41:28.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do have faith in God’s promises,

00:41:28.006 --> 00:41:31.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if a gun is what I need
to protect my family,

00:41:31.634 --> 00:41:33.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:42:18.264 --> 00:42:21.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I couldn’t do that.

00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:23.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not the first to face a violent world.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:5:

00:42:27.607 --> 00:42:31.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . received the witness
that he had pleased God well.”

00:42:31.694 --> 00:42:35.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch lived among extreme violence,

00:42:35.532 --> 00:42:37.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he walked with God.

00:42:41.704 --> 00:42:44.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can imitate his faith.

00:42:58.596 --> 00:43:03.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
this brother’s violence-reaction plan?

00:43:03.393 --> 00:43:07.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith in God’s promises helped him
to look to Jehovah for security

00:43:07.897 --> 00:43:10.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of a gun.

00:43:10.108 --> 00:43:13.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized he was not the first
to face a violent world

00:43:13.987 --> 00:43:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made the firm decision
to imitate the faith of Enoch.

00:43:18.867 --> 00:43:22.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, prior to a violent confrontation,

00:43:22.871 --> 00:43:26.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can we do to be sure our reaction plan

00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:29.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be pleasing to Jehovah?

00:43:29.669 --> 00:43:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate Enoch in these four ways.

00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build our faith and confidence in Jehovah now

00:43:36.593 --> 00:43:40.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we are tested in a violent situation.

00:43:41.473 --> 00:43:44.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reject violent thoughts.

00:43:44.142 --> 00:43:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow the violent movies
or violent video games

00:43:48.104 --> 00:43:50.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are sponsored by the Devil

00:43:50.231 --> 00:43:52.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to train your children or yourselves

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:56.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to react in a violent confrontation.

00:43:57.655 --> 00:44:01.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reject the idea that you will prepare
yourselves with weapons.

00:44:01.993 --> 00:44:06.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And fearlessly keep preaching
as Enoch did.

00:44:07.457 --> 00:44:11.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, even if we find ourselves

00:44:11.002 --> 00:44:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a violent situation,

00:44:13.129 --> 00:44:16.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our violence-reaction plan

00:44:16.007 --> 00:44:18.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will allow us to imitate Enoch

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please God well.

00:44:22.388 --> 00:44:26.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother John Ekrann,
a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee,

00:44:26.184 --> 00:44:29.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider the next talk
of this symposium,

00:44:29.437 --> 00:44:32.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless

00:44:32.524 --> 00:44:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Noah, Not His Neighbors.”

00:44:42.158 --> 00:44:46.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus compared our days
with the days of Noah.

00:44:46.746 --> 00:44:49.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus would know because he was in heaven

00:44:49.582 --> 00:44:53.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watched the days of Noah
go from bad to worse.

00:44:53.586 --> 00:44:56.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how bad were the days of Noah?

00:44:56.714 --> 00:45:01.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Genesis 6:5 for a description:

00:45:03.263 --> 00:45:05.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Consequently, Jehovah saw

00:45:05.598 --> 00:45:08.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that man’s wickedness was great on the earth

00:45:08.518 --> 00:45:11.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that every inclination of the thoughts

00:45:11.604 --> 00:45:16.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his heart was only bad all the time.”

00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wickedness on the earth was made worse

00:45:19.195 --> 00:45:22.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by wicked angels
that abandoned their role in heaven

00:45:22.699 --> 00:45:26.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and materialized
into human bodies to marry women on earth.

00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:29.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These unholy marriages produced sons

00:45:29.163 --> 00:45:32.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were giants called Nephilim.

00:45:32.917 --> 00:45:35.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, parents, we could ask,

00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:37.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine what it must have been like

00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:42.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Noah and his wife
to raise a family in that ungodly world?

00:45:43.803 --> 00:45:46.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you don’t really need
to imagine it, do you?

00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:49.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one look around us and we can all see

00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we live in a world
that fits the same description,

00:45:53.396 --> 00:45:57.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if not worse, than the days of Noah.

00:45:57.275 --> 00:45:59.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Noah’s faith was tested,

00:45:59.777 --> 00:46:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your faith will likely be tested too

00:46:02.363 --> 00:46:07.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you raise a family in this ungodly world.

00:46:07.285 --> 00:46:10.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please do not allow the pressures at work,

00:46:10.955 --> 00:46:15.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from relatives, or from others
make you think that material things

00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are more important
than your family’s relationship with Jehovah.

00:46:20.048 --> 00:46:23.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can remain faithful

00:46:23.051 --> 00:46:26.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by imitating Noah, not his neighbors.

00:46:27.847 --> 00:46:32.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
note how a parent’s faith is tested.

00:46:37.774 --> 00:46:40.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another busy day:

00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:42.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter is going to preach,

00:46:42.362 --> 00:46:45.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m off to work,
and it’s Family Worship night.

00:46:46.866 --> 00:46:48.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye, Dad.

00:46:48.326 --> 00:46:49.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a good day, Sweetie.

00:46:55.917 --> 00:46:57.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, listen up!

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got an announcement for everybody.

00:47:00.213 --> 00:47:01.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting this Monday . . .

00:47:01.506 --> 00:47:04.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?
More required overtime?

00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:06.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, that’s it.
That’s all I’ve got.

00:47:06.344 --> 00:47:07.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s get back to work!

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s extra money.

00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:12.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can I do it <i>and</i>  take care of Regina?

00:47:25.613 --> 00:47:28.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . to your local channel 17,
where news comes first.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad, isn’t it Family Worship night?

00:47:31.536 --> 00:47:32.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . to affect millions
as economies are . . .

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:34.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe a little later, Sweetie.

00:47:34.831 --> 00:47:37.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the worst financial crisis in decades.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violence and looting continue . . .

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, but I was spent

00:47:42.547 --> 00:47:44.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again.

00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:48.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother knew it was Family Worship night,

00:47:48.553 --> 00:47:53.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but extra work and the pressures of life
were dragging him down.

00:47:53.266 --> 00:47:55.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith was being tested.

00:47:55.685 --> 00:47:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he imitate Noah or his neighbors?

00:47:59.856 --> 00:48:01.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s neighbors lacked faith.

00:48:01.941 --> 00:48:04.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not do what was needed
to save their families.

00:48:04.902 --> 00:48:07.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, Jesus said they were so distracted

00:48:07.905 --> 00:48:10.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their daily lives, “eating and drinking”

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting married
that “they took no note

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:18.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the Flood came
and [took] them all away.”

00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:22.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, Noah took note.

00:48:22.086 --> 00:48:25.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah acted in faith to save his household.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:28.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the beautiful description
of Noah’s faith

00:48:28.676 --> 00:48:31.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Hebrews 11:7:

00:48:33.973 --> 00:48:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Noah,
after receiving divine warning

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of things not yet seen, showed godly fear

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and constructed an ark
for the saving of his household;

00:48:44.692 --> 00:48:48.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through this faith
he condemned the world,

00:48:48.404 --> 00:48:51.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he became an heir of the righteousness

00:48:51.407 --> 00:48:53.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that results from faith.”

00:48:56.746 --> 00:49:00.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s actions saved his household.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be sure it was not always easy

00:49:03.336 --> 00:49:05.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Noah to explain to his sons

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:09.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why they were building an ark
and no one else was

00:49:09.091 --> 00:49:14.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or why building it was more important
than anything else they had to do.

00:49:14.096 --> 00:49:17.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His three boys would have seen the Nephilim.

00:49:17.475 --> 00:49:20.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah and his wife
could hardly have shielded their boys

00:49:20.812 --> 00:49:25.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from all the stories
that circulated about those giants.

00:49:25.316 --> 00:49:30.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine some of the discussions
that Noah and his wife had with their boys.

00:49:30.321 --> 00:49:34.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The materialized wicked angels
and their Nephilim sons

00:49:34.659 --> 00:49:37.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were men of fame and admired by everyone

00:49:37.912 --> 00:49:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their superhuman capabilities.

00:49:40.957 --> 00:49:44.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even today, people
are fascinated with stories

00:49:44.335 --> 00:49:47.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and movies of humans with superpowers.

00:49:49.006 --> 00:49:53.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those wicked angels
and their sons, the Nephilim,

00:49:53.886 --> 00:49:56.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were nothing to be admired or imitated.

00:49:56.889 --> 00:50:01.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah taught his sons
not to admire or copy them.

00:50:01.519 --> 00:50:03.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to help their boys see

00:50:03.521 --> 00:50:08.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah felt hurt by the violence
and rebellion in the world.

00:50:08.484 --> 00:50:13.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boys needed to learn
to love Jehovah and imitate him.

00:50:15.116 --> 00:50:18.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, take the time to teach your children

00:50:18.744 --> 00:50:23.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hate what Jehovah hates
and to love what Jehovah loves.

00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:27.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hates liars, cheaters,

00:50:27.086 --> 00:50:30.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bullies, selfishness, and greed.

00:50:30.089 --> 00:50:33.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, Jehovah loves honesty,

00:50:33.092 --> 00:50:37.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace, love, sharing, and self-control.

00:50:38.973 --> 00:50:40.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah, like any good father,

00:50:40.975 --> 00:50:44.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to make sure his family
had a comfortable place to live

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:46.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and good food to eat.

00:50:46.939 --> 00:50:51.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the houses that Noah and his sons
could have built for themselves.

00:50:51.277 --> 00:50:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They certainly had
the construction experience.

00:50:54.363 --> 00:50:58.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was not Noah’s focus.

00:50:58.034 --> 00:51:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s life had more meaning and purpose

00:51:01.037 --> 00:51:04.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than building houses, eating, and drinking.

00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:10.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah taught by example and kept his focus

00:51:10.254 --> 00:51:13.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on saving his household
from the coming Flood.

00:51:15.593 --> 00:51:19.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likely had times
when he felt tired or overwhelmed

00:51:19.013 --> 00:51:23.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the sheer size
and scope of building an ark.

00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:27.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Noah
did not allow his day-to-day life

00:51:27.605 --> 00:51:29.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to crowd out his service to Jehovah.

00:51:29.857 --> 00:51:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made sure that no matter what else
was happening in his life,

00:51:33.903 --> 00:51:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work of building the ark
kept moving forward.

00:51:39.116 --> 00:51:41.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother we saw in the video

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he was tired and overwhelmed
by his work and job.

00:51:45.873 --> 00:51:48.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us can identify with how he feels.

00:51:48.876 --> 00:51:52.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in this system is hard.

00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate the hard work and effort

00:51:55.591 --> 00:51:57.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you parents are making

00:51:57.718 --> 00:52:02.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep a good spiritual routine
for your family.

00:52:02.682 --> 00:52:05.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know how tempting it can be to say:

00:52:05.726 --> 00:52:07.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, we’ll study later”

00:52:07.937 --> 00:52:11.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “We’ll pick it up again next week.”

00:52:11.649 --> 00:52:14.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See the danger.

00:52:14.568 --> 00:52:17.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Putting off our spiritual routine this week

00:52:17.488 --> 00:52:20.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can easily lead to three weeks

00:52:20.366 --> 00:52:24.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then six weeks and then not at all.

00:52:25.705 --> 00:52:30.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah took care
of Noah and his family’s material needs,

00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:34.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can be confident that Jehovah
will take care of you and your family.

00:52:34.547 --> 00:52:38.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will bless you for your obedience.

00:52:38.217 --> 00:52:40.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how our brother imitates Noah’s faith.

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violence and looting continue
despite curfews . . .

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world is such a mess.

00:52:50.104 --> 00:52:53.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s everything Jesus said it would be.

00:52:53.524 --> 00:52:56.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so good

00:52:56.027 --> 00:52:59.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spiritually-minded like her mother was.

00:53:00.573 --> 00:53:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I expect she’ll stay that way on her own?

00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:13.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . rise in the wake
of a massive earthquake

00:53:13.127 --> 00:53:15.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a magnitude of 8.1, which struck . . .

00:53:15.629 --> 00:53:18.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leaders from around the world
have come together

00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:20.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made notable statements 
on social media today

00:53:20.885 --> 00:53:23.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing confidence.

00:53:23.554 --> 00:53:25.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One leader posted:

00:53:25.556 --> 00:53:28.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, we are seeing global coordination

00:53:28.559 --> 00:53:31.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that gives us a hope of a secure future.

00:53:31.604 --> 00:53:35.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a unique opportunity
to end armed conflict.”

00:53:47.536 --> 00:53:50.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . unrest sweeping across the country.

00:53:50.206 --> 00:53:54.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, our community has been affected
by a soar in gun violence.

00:53:54.001 --> 00:53:55.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of right now, . . .

00:53:55.044 --> 00:53:57.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it is just like Noah’s day,

00:53:57.379 --> 00:53:59.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to show faith like he did.

00:53:59.715 --> 00:54:02.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . are dead, 
including a 17-year-old teenager.

00:54:06.388 --> 00:54:08.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do our family worship.

00:54:08.432 --> 00:54:09.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:54:11.727 --> 00:54:15.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to show faith in Jehovah

00:54:15.606 --> 00:54:19.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work hard to save my family.

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:27.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
how our brother acted in faith?

00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:33.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother imagined
what could happen to his daughter

00:54:33.749 --> 00:54:38.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she lost her spirituality
and adopted the lifestyle of the world.

00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:41.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he saw really scared him.

00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:44.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He immediately turned off the TV

00:54:44.802 --> 00:54:47.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and joined his daughter for family worship.

00:54:49.098 --> 00:54:51.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah knew that building the ark

00:54:51.517 --> 00:54:54.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would save his family from the coming Flood

00:54:54.436 --> 00:54:59.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but only if they were in the ark with him.

00:54:59.358 --> 00:55:04.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not want to see his sons
adopt the lifestyle of his neighbors.

00:55:04.363 --> 00:55:07.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah did everything he could to make sure

00:55:07.241 --> 00:55:09.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he taught his sons to love Jehovah

00:55:09.827 --> 00:55:13.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by his words and his actions.

00:55:13.622 --> 00:55:16.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, by imitating Noah,

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:21.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can save both yourself and your family.

00:55:23.591 --> 00:55:27.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Seth Hyatt,
a helper with the Service Committee,

00:55:27.636 --> 00:55:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:55:31.307 --> 00:55:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate the Faithful,
Not the Faithless—Moses, Not Pharaoh.”

00:55:43.903 --> 00:55:46.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For almost 40 years,

00:55:46.238 --> 00:55:50.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses enjoyed a life of comfort and privilege

00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:54.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the adopted son of Pharaoh’s daughter.

00:55:54.455 --> 00:55:58.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among the advantages were material prosperity

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and advanced education.

00:56:00.502 --> 00:56:03.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might those advantages

00:56:03.464 --> 00:56:07.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have affected Moses’ outlook?

00:56:07.092 --> 00:56:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gain some insight
from an incident that took place

00:56:10.346 --> 00:56:12.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Moses was 80 years of age.

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:16.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s recorded in Exodus chapter 5.

00:56:16.268 --> 00:56:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, in a conversation with the Pharaoh,

00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:22.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Pharaoh is reported
to have said to Moses:

00:56:22.024 --> 00:56:25.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who is Jehovah,
that I should obey his voice . . . ?

00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:28.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know Jehovah at all.”

00:56:28.572 --> 00:56:31.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No truer words have ever been spoken

00:56:31.325 --> 00:56:34.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Pharaoh did not know Jehovah 

00:56:34.411 --> 00:56:37.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result, had no faith in him.

00:56:37.248 --> 00:56:39.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was faithless.

00:56:39.917 --> 00:56:42.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His haughty words,

00:56:42.127 --> 00:56:44.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dismissive of Jehovah,

00:56:44.838 --> 00:56:47.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt reflected the Egyptian belief

00:56:47.758 --> 00:56:50.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Pharaoh was himself a god.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Moses’ outlook

00:56:53.931 --> 00:56:58.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affected in a negative way
by that Egyptian culture?

00:56:58.727 --> 00:57:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:57:00.229 --> 00:57:03.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see a refreshing contrast.

00:57:03.232 --> 00:57:05.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was a humble man,

00:57:05.859 --> 00:57:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man of faith who, at the age of 40,

00:57:08.904 --> 00:57:13.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a decision that reflected
the depth of that faith

00:57:13.617 --> 00:57:16.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that changed his life forever.

00:57:16.662 --> 00:57:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why should you and I

00:57:18.664 --> 00:57:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be interested in Moses’ example of faith?

00:57:22.376 --> 00:57:24.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because like Moses,

00:57:24.545 --> 00:57:29.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we face situations that require choices

00:57:29.383 --> 00:57:33.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—decisions that reflect
the quality of our faith.

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:37.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, note how an elder

00:57:37.683 --> 00:57:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faces a test of his faith
in the following dramatization.

00:57:53.282 --> 00:57:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny is going to look after the business

00:57:55.284 --> 00:57:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while we’re away.

00:57:59.663 --> 00:58:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only scheduled a few small jobs.

00:58:03.459 --> 00:58:05.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure he can handle it.

00:58:13.177 --> 00:58:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our assigned convention,

00:58:15.429 --> 00:58:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I planned as best I could
for us to go together.

00:58:21.935 --> 00:58:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some things

00:58:24.188 --> 00:58:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you just can’t see coming.

00:58:26.815 --> 00:58:28.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:58:28.067 --> 00:58:30.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny was in a panic.

00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got trouble calls
from my two biggest accounts.

00:58:36.367 --> 00:58:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was bad.

00:58:41.622 --> 00:58:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t lose their business.

00:58:47.378 --> 00:58:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For just a few minutes,

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider what the Scriptures
have to say about Moses’ faith

00:58:53.175 --> 00:58:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider four ways
that we can imitate him.

00:58:57.137 --> 00:59:00.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:05.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to begin reading in verse 24

00:59:05.312 --> 00:59:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 11:24:

00:59:08.649 --> 00:59:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Moses, when grown up,

00:59:12.111 --> 00:59:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,

00:59:16.198 --> 00:59:19.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“choosing to be
mistreated with the people of God

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to have
the temporary enjoyment of sin.”

00:59:25.958 --> 00:59:29.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first thing that Moses did?

00:59:29.628 --> 00:59:34.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He rejected the proud,
selfish thinking of that Egyptian world.

00:59:34.675 --> 00:59:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He chose to be mistreated

00:59:38.887 --> 00:59:41.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Israelites who were slaves

00:59:41.598 --> 00:59:44.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to align himself with a culture

00:59:44.935 --> 00:59:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that dismissed Jehovah.

00:59:48.772 --> 00:59:51.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What prompted that decision?

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening words of verse 24 tell us

00:59:53.986 --> 00:59:57.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Moses was a man of faith,

00:59:57.739 --> 01:00:01.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his faith shaped his decisions

01:00:01.702 --> 01:00:05.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not his culture, not community pressure—

01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:07.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his faith.

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s our second point.

01:00:10.919 --> 01:00:13.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s continue reading in verse 26:

01:00:13.839 --> 01:00:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because he considered
the reproach of the Christ

01:00:17.426 --> 01:00:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be riches greater
than the treasures of Egypt,

01:00:21.096 --> 01:00:25.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

01:00:27.811 --> 01:00:31.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses received an assignment,

01:00:31.773 --> 01:00:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a commission, from Jehovah,

01:00:35.027 --> 01:00:39.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he viewed
that commission as more valuable

01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:41.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than anything that Egypt had to offer.

01:00:41.742 --> 01:00:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned his back on the comforts of Egypt

01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:50.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and aligned himself with Jehovah
and the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose.

01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:53.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third point:

01:00:53.921 --> 01:00:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had clear spiritual vision.

01:00:56.757 --> 01:00:59.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

01:00:59.718 --> 01:01:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses could see outside the “Egypt box,”

01:01:03.639 --> 01:01:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could see the fulfillment

01:01:05.974 --> 01:01:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s wonderful promises
to Abraham and Abraham’s descendants.

01:01:11.855 --> 01:01:16.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual vision
is commented on further in verse 27:

01:01:17.778 --> 01:01:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith he left Egypt,

01:01:19.988 --> 01:01:22.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not fearing the anger of the king,

01:01:22.741 --> 01:01:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he continued steadfast

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as seeing the One who is invisible.”

01:01:29.665 --> 01:01:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Moses could see the Pharaoh,

01:01:32.918 --> 01:01:35.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with his clear spiritual vision,

01:01:35.796 --> 01:01:37.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could see Jehovah.

01:01:37.881 --> 01:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses had an unbreakable friendship
with Jehovah,

01:01:42.886 --> 01:01:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so can you.

01:01:45.013 --> 01:01:48.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The quality of any friendship can be measured

01:01:48.058 --> 01:01:51.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the quality of communication
that characterizes it.

01:01:53.146 --> 01:01:57.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regular heartfelt prayer
and meaningful study of the Bible

01:01:57.734 --> 01:02:00.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constitute two-way communication

01:02:00.821 --> 01:02:04.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between an individual and Jehovah.

01:02:04.449 --> 01:02:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we get to know Jehovah better and better

01:02:07.369 --> 01:02:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as our faith strengthens and deepens,

01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:16.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then our decisions reflect that faith.

01:02:16.587 --> 01:02:20.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in our words and actions,

01:02:20.757 --> 01:02:24.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we give evidence of that faith.

01:02:24.177 --> 01:02:26.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that brings us to the fourth point:

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:31.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the opening words of verse 27:

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:35.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith [Moses] left Egypt.”

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith was of such quality

01:02:38.483 --> 01:02:42.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was evidenced
in his words and his actions.

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:45.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, Moses was a man of action

01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:48.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he left Egypt.

01:02:48.285 --> 01:02:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was also a man
who expressed his convictions.

01:02:52.706 --> 01:02:57.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Moses and the Israelites
stood on the shore of the Red Sea

01:02:57.336 --> 01:03:00.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Pharaoh
and his armies behind them

01:03:00.172 --> 01:03:02.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Red Sea in front of them

01:03:02.382 --> 01:03:05.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seemingly nowhere to go,

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did Moses strengthen the people?

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:10.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid.

01:03:10.641 --> 01:03:15.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stand [still] and see
the salvation of Jehovah.”

01:03:16.938 --> 01:03:20.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words must have
strengthened the Israelites.

01:03:20.609 --> 01:03:25.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,
we can strengthen those around us,

01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:29.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether in the preaching work, in our
dealings with our family, or with others.

01:03:29.951 --> 01:03:33.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our faith is voiced

01:03:33.455 --> 01:03:38.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and evidenced
in the things that we say and do,

01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:42.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re a blessing to those around us.

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:46.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s important
that we stay humble as Moses did

01:03:46.343 --> 01:03:50.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ever receptive
to Jehovah’s direction and counsel

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:53.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he provides
through his Word and his organization.

01:03:55.102 --> 01:03:59.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how about that elder who we met earlier.

01:03:59.272 --> 01:04:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in and see how he imitates Moses

01:04:03.735 --> 01:04:05.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making a decision.

01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:10.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, just find the parts,

01:04:10.617 --> 01:04:12.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll call you back.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will take all weekend.

01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:17.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want us to go?

01:04:17.499 --> 01:04:20.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you get the program later?

01:04:20.127 --> 01:04:23.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, and I’ll have to text John
that I can’t be an attendant.

01:04:23.922 --> 01:04:26.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will I miss that I can’t get later?

01:04:38.979 --> 01:04:41.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:26 it says

01:04:42.733 --> 01:04:46.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses “considered the reproach of the Christ

01:04:46.528 --> 01:04:50.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be riches greater
than the treasure of Egypt,

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:54.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

01:04:55.328 --> 01:04:58.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of what value is being a prince of Egypt
compared with being . . .

01:04:58.165 --> 01:04:59.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey?

01:05:02.627 --> 01:05:05.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey, what do you think?

01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:15.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny?

01:05:15.474 --> 01:05:16.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

01:05:16.767 --> 01:05:18.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what I want you to do for now,

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:21.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll pick up the pieces when I get back.

01:05:26.026 --> 01:05:28.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the elder

01:05:28.653 --> 01:05:32.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a decision based on his faith?

01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:34.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With his eyes of faith,

01:05:34.951 --> 01:05:38.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could see the blessings
that he and his family would enjoy

01:05:38.538 --> 01:05:42.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they attended the convention together, 

01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:46.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he made a decision as a spiritual man.

01:05:46.546 --> 01:05:49.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way, if we imitate Moses

01:05:49.299 --> 01:05:52.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by rejecting the proud,
selfish thinking of the world

01:05:52.677 --> 01:05:57.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowing our decisions
to be shaped by our faith

01:05:57.599 --> 01:06:00.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not by culture or community pressure,

01:06:00.685 --> 01:06:03.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we maintain clear spiritual vision,

01:06:03.688 --> 01:06:07.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if our faith is evidenced
in our words and actions,

01:06:07.108 --> 01:06:11.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can be confident of Jehovah’s support

01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:14.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his hand of salvation in our behalf,

01:06:14.616 --> 01:06:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he did for Moses.

01:06:18.453 --> 01:06:21.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

01:06:21.873 --> 01:06:25.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider
the final talk of this symposium,

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:29.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless

01:06:29.047 --> 01:06:33.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus’ Disciples, Not the Pharisees.”

01:06:40.183 --> 01:06:44.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus called them
“serpents, offspring of vipers.”

01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:46.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is he talking about?

01:06:46.106 --> 01:06:47.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Pharisees.

01:06:47.691 --> 01:06:49.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who were they?

01:06:49.192 --> 01:06:53.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A prominent, Jewish religious sect
in the first century.

01:06:53.405 --> 01:06:55.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Jesus so critical of them?

01:06:55.949 --> 01:07:00.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because even though
those religious leaders had knowledge of God

01:07:00.453 --> 01:07:05.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prided themselves on their
strict adherence to the Law of Moses,

01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:07.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they did not do as Moses had said

01:07:07.669 --> 01:07:09.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to listen to the future Savior

01:07:09.921 --> 01:07:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah would raise up for his people.

01:07:14.009 --> 01:07:16.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Savior is Jesus Christ.

01:07:16.887 --> 01:07:21.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the Pharisees saw him
miraculously curing the sick, lame, and blind

01:07:21.474 --> 01:07:23.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even resurrecting the dead—

01:07:23.602 --> 01:07:25.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they did not rejoice over that

01:07:25.687 --> 01:07:29.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and glorify God for what he
was performing through Christ.

01:07:29.733 --> 01:07:32.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Pharisees were faithless,

01:07:32.193 --> 01:07:36.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they refused to believe in
and listen to God’s Son.

01:07:36.698 --> 01:07:40.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, they persecuted Jesus’ disciples

01:07:40.243 --> 01:07:44.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they did put faith in the Christ.

01:07:44.164 --> 01:07:46.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus exposed the Pharisees

01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what they were and called them “serpents”

01:07:49.419 --> 01:07:51.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the deadly spiritual harm

01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:55.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they inflicted on others
who were influenced by them.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:59.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Pharisees
exerted such great influence over the people

01:07:59.763 --> 01:08:03.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prominent persons
were afraid to openly confess

01:08:03.016 --> 01:08:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their faith in Jesus
for fear of being expelled

01:08:06.102 --> 01:08:08.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from their positions in the synagogue

01:08:08.146 --> 01:08:10.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and losing face in the community.

01:08:12.108 --> 01:08:14.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can the same sort of fear

01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:16.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hold people back today from serving Jehovah

01:08:16.905 --> 01:08:19.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a disciple of God’s Son,

01:08:19.157 --> 01:08:21.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fearing the rejection or ridicule

01:08:21.409 --> 01:08:25.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they might have to endure
from neighbors, friends, or family?

01:08:25.914 --> 01:08:28.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:08:28.166 --> 01:08:31.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how a Bible student’s faith is tested 

01:08:31.753 --> 01:08:35.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he thinks about whether
he could start sharing in the ministry

01:08:35.423 --> 01:08:38.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:08:44.724 --> 01:08:47.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my Bible study.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s changed my life,

01:08:51.064 --> 01:08:54.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really want to start in the ministry.

01:08:55.318 --> 01:08:56.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:58.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my town,

01:08:58.947 --> 01:09:00.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everybody knows you

01:09:02.659 --> 01:09:05.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you do.

01:09:16.297 --> 01:09:19.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not ashamed of the good news.

01:09:19.259 --> 01:09:21.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if I become a Witness?

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:24.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family business has two employees

01:09:24.639 --> 01:09:27.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Dad and me.

01:09:27.058 --> 01:09:27.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Dad.

01:09:27.934 --> 01:09:28.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Nelson.

01:09:28.893 --> 01:09:30.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they leave yet?

01:09:31.146 --> 01:09:33.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, they uh—
They actually just left.

01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:35.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, Son, going to meetings is one thing,

01:09:35.984 --> 01:09:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if you’re out there preaching,

01:09:38.194 --> 01:09:40.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll both be out of work.

01:09:40.989 --> 01:09:42.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nelson.

01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:43.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nelson!

01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:48.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see how Nelson’s faith
was being tested?

01:09:48.872 --> 01:09:51.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to decide whether to be more concerned

01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:53.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what other humans thought of him

01:09:53.793 --> 01:09:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or doing all that he could
to secure Jehovah’s approval.

01:09:58.214 --> 01:10:01.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your faith being tested like Nelson’s?

01:10:01.676 --> 01:10:06.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it is, how can you
imitate Jesus’ disciples?

01:10:06.306 --> 01:10:08.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They not only knew about God

01:10:08.725 --> 01:10:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they trusted in him
as their reliable Father and Friend.

01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As proof of that, they went right
onto the temple grounds in Jerusalem 

01:10:17.233 --> 01:10:21.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in full view of everyone
and gave a bold witness about God’s Son.

01:10:21.863 --> 01:10:25.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were powerful by their faith.

01:10:25.617 --> 01:10:29.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Jewish high court
—many members of which were Pharisees—

01:10:29.037 --> 01:10:31.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heard about this, they were furious.

01:10:31.748 --> 01:10:35.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They ordered the disciples
to stop teaching about Jesus.

01:10:35.794 --> 01:10:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did they do?

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cower in fear?

01:10:38.963 --> 01:10:40.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:10:40.632 --> 01:10:45.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can read what happened at Acts 5:29

01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:49.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s Acts 5:29.

01:10:49.682 --> 01:10:51.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reports:

01:10:51.684 --> 01:10:55.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In answer Peter
and the other apostles said:

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:59.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We must obey God as ruler rather than men.’”

01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ disciples did not allow

01:11:03.113 --> 01:11:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the religious leaders’ pressure
and threats to deter them.

01:11:06.783 --> 01:11:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew their priorities
and that situations would arise

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a Christian cannot obey
both men and Jehovah God.

01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:19.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, human rulers forfeit
their right to our obedience

01:11:19.838 --> 01:11:24.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they demand what Almighty God prohibits

01:11:24.008 --> 01:11:26.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, as in this case,

01:11:26.553 --> 01:11:30.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they prohibit what God requires of us.

01:11:30.849 --> 01:11:33.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if they ban our preaching work,

01:11:33.685 --> 01:11:35.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cannot stop carrying out

01:11:35.687 --> 01:11:38.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God-given assignment
to preach the good news.

01:11:38.606 --> 01:11:42.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at that very moment,

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:44.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostles set a precedent

01:11:44.362 --> 01:11:47.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all true Christians throughout the ages

01:11:47.031 --> 01:11:51.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to obey God as Ruler first.

01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:55.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The disciples’ faith made them
real friends of Jehovah.

01:11:55.039 --> 01:11:59.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, today they are alive
and well in heaven with Jesus

01:11:59.752 --> 01:12:02.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve with him as kings and priests.

01:12:02.797 --> 01:12:07.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What of those faithless Pharisees
and their coveted prominence?

01:12:07.594 --> 01:12:09.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told them to their face

01:12:09.888 --> 01:12:12.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what fate lay ahead of them

01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:15.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Matthew chapter 23

01:12:15.727 --> 01:12:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 33.

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:22.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 23:33,

01:12:22.734 --> 01:12:26.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told them: “Serpents, offspring of vipers,

01:12:26.446 --> 01:12:31.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will you flee
from the judgment of Gehenna?”

01:12:31.159 --> 01:12:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, “the judgment of Gehenna”
meant that if they did not change,

01:12:34.704 --> 01:12:38.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would be everlastingly destroyed.

01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:41.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we are going
to imitate the disciples’ faith,

01:12:41.419 --> 01:12:45.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must do as Jesus urged his followers.

01:12:45.423 --> 01:12:50.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See what he said at Matthew 6:33

01:12:50.428 --> 01:12:54.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:33:

01:12:54.265 --> 01:12:58.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on, then, seeking first
the Kingdom and his righteousness,

01:12:58.603 --> 01:13:02.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all these other things
will be added to you.”

01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus’ disciples must always make

01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:08.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom their first concern in life.

01:13:08.071 --> 01:13:11.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do that, then, as Jesus promised,

01:13:11.157 --> 01:13:13.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will see to it
that we have the material

01:13:13.743 --> 01:13:16.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spiritual necessities of life.

01:13:16.746 --> 01:13:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, ‘seeking the Kingdom’ first
in our life includes

01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘preaching the good news of the Kingdom’
to as many people as we can.

01:13:24.879 --> 01:13:28.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As with Jesus’ disciples,
it requires courage and boldness

01:13:28.633 --> 01:13:33.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach when neighbors,
friends, or family oppose us.

01:13:33.471 --> 01:13:37.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do not need to fear them
or any other religious enemies

01:13:37.684 --> 01:13:40.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jesus taught his disciples

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:44.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to preach boldly but discreetly.

01:13:44.274 --> 01:13:48.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see this at Matthew chapter 10

01:13:48.194 --> 01:13:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 16.

01:13:50.446 --> 01:13:55.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 10:16,

01:13:55.076 --> 01:14:00.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “Look! I am sending you out 
as sheep among wolves;

01:14:00.039 --> 01:14:03.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so prove yourselves cautious as serpents

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:06.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet innocent as doves.”

01:14:06.963 --> 01:14:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that most literal snakes
would rather flee than attack.

01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:14.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to be cautious, here, means to be prudent,

01:14:14.846 --> 01:14:17.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sensible, shrewd.

01:14:17.015 --> 01:14:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the dove is known
as “the sheep of the bird world”

01:14:19.892 --> 01:14:23.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of its gentle appearance
and disposition.

01:14:23.271 --> 01:14:26.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to be innocent means being blameless,

01:14:26.441 --> 01:14:28.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or genuine, with pure motives.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ point was that when
his sheeplike disciples face persecution,

01:14:33.573 --> 01:14:37.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they need to combine
the characteristics of being cautious

01:14:37.201 --> 01:14:40.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and innocent to avoid possible dangers

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they carry out their preaching work.

01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:48.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
suppose colleagues at work, schoolmates,

01:14:48.463 --> 01:14:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even members
of your own family make caustic remarks

01:14:51.924 --> 01:14:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about your beliefs as a Witness of Jehovah.

01:14:55.386 --> 01:14:57.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of responding in kind

01:14:57.472 --> 01:15:00.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by being equally sarcastic about their faith,

01:15:00.558 --> 01:15:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show them that their comments have no effect

01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:06.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your peace and your pleasant demeanor.

01:15:06.147 --> 01:15:09.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s being prudent and blameless,

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cautious yet innocent.

01:15:13.905 --> 01:15:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the rest of the dramatization
that we saw earlier.

01:15:17.533 --> 01:15:20.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nelson had just heard
his dad tell him over the phone,

01:15:20.953 --> 01:15:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Going to meetings is one thing,

01:15:22.955 --> 01:15:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if you’re out there preaching,
we’ll both be out of work.”

01:15:26.376 --> 01:15:28.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see if Nelson will imitate

01:15:28.628 --> 01:15:31.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith of Jesus’ disciples.

01:15:35.385 --> 01:15:37.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Dad right?

01:15:37.053 --> 01:15:40.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d be ruined if I became a Witness?

01:15:40.765 --> 01:15:43.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would happen if I don’t?

01:15:46.562 --> 01:15:48.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Nelson.

01:15:48.314 --> 01:15:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, good morning.

01:15:50.233 --> 01:15:51.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, good morning, Keith.

01:15:53.361 --> 01:15:54.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing here?

01:15:54.362 --> 01:15:55.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen, nobody wants to talk to you people.

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:58.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rob and Nick live in the same town

01:15:58.366 --> 01:16:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the same pressures,

01:16:01.744 --> 01:16:03.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they preach

01:16:03.955 --> 01:16:06.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support their families.

01:16:09.377 --> 01:16:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their joy is real.

01:16:24.642 --> 01:16:27.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really want fear of man to stop me

01:16:27.186 --> 01:16:30.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from becoming Jesus’ disciple?

01:16:30.022 --> 01:16:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 3:36 says:

01:16:32.733 --> 01:16:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who exercises faith in the Son

01:16:35.945 --> 01:16:38.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has everlasting life.”

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to exercise my faith

01:16:42.118 --> 01:16:44.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let Jehovah do the rest.

01:16:56.841 --> 01:16:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the question
that Nelson asked himself,

01:16:59.969 --> 01:17:03.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do I really want fear of man to stop me

01:17:03.014 --> 01:17:06.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from becoming Jesus’ disciple?”

01:17:06.058 --> 01:17:08.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He answered that by saying,

01:17:08.186 --> 01:17:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s time to exercise my faith
and let Jehovah do the rest.”

01:17:13.107 --> 01:17:16.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he happily began demonstrating
his faith in Jehovah

01:17:16.569 --> 01:17:19.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sharing in the Christian ministry.

01:17:19.697 --> 01:17:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like him, we all need to keep imitating

01:17:23.493 --> 01:17:26.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith of Jesus’ disciples.

01:17:27.663 --> 01:17:30.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what have we learned
from this symposium?

01:17:30.374 --> 01:17:31.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things.

01:17:31.667 --> 01:17:36.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we must reject
the course of faithless ones

01:17:36.506 --> 01:17:38.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Cain, Lamech,

01:17:38.883 --> 01:17:42.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s neighbors, Pharaoh, and the Pharisees.

01:17:42.887 --> 01:17:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we need
to imitate Jehovah’s faithful servants

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:50.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Abel, Enoch, Noah,

01:17:50.728 --> 01:17:54.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses, and Jesus’ disciples.

01:17:54.106 --> 01:17:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, then we can enjoy living forever

01:17:58.528 --> 01:18:00.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a friend of Jehovah.

01:18:02.573 --> 01:18:04.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers!

01:18:04.617 --> 01:18:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are determined to imitate
the good examples that you discussed,

01:18:08.538 --> 01:18:11.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when our faith is tested.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now come to the final talk
of today’s program.

01:18:16.879 --> 01:18:21.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we regularly need to examine
our lives and our worship?

01:18:21.425 --> 01:18:24.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what ways should we do so?

01:18:24.262 --> 01:18:26.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body

01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:29.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will direct us to the Bible’s answer.

01:18:29.475 --> 01:18:31.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme is

01:18:31.477 --> 01:18:35.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Keep Testing Whether You Are in the Faith’
—How?”

01:18:43.114 --> 01:18:46.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you own a car or a motorbike

01:18:46.158 --> 01:18:49.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other type of vehicle?

01:18:49.036 --> 01:18:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, you realize that it brings with it

01:18:52.415 --> 01:18:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a serious responsibility.

01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:58.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, it costs quite a bit of money
to buy a vehicle,

01:18:58.421 --> 01:19:02.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also you need to keep on spending money
to keep it running.

01:19:03.384 --> 01:19:07.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to that,
there is another serious responsibility

01:19:07.888 --> 01:19:10.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes with owning a vehicle.

01:19:10.224 --> 01:19:14.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the responsibility
to maintain it safely

01:19:14.979 --> 01:19:18.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it doesn’t break down,
doesn’t cause accidents

01:19:18.941 --> 01:19:22.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,
doesn’t cause loss of life.

01:19:23.654 --> 01:19:27.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if you have a maintenance program,

01:19:27.074 --> 01:19:30.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not just going to wait
for something to fall off the vehicle

01:19:30.953 --> 01:19:33.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps for it just to stop.

01:19:33.414 --> 01:19:37.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, ahead of time,
you have to have a checklist

01:19:37.376 --> 01:19:40.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see that everything is working properly.

01:19:41.714 --> 01:19:45.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way, spiritually speaking,

01:19:45.551 --> 01:19:48.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one of us needs a maintenance program

01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:51.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our spirituality.

01:19:51.599 --> 01:19:54.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What sort of maintenance program
are we talking about?

01:19:54.935 --> 01:19:56.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s take our Bibles, please,

01:19:56.937 --> 01:20:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn to the second book of Corinthians

01:20:00.316 --> 01:20:03.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 13 and verse 5,

01:20:03.986 --> 01:20:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians 13:5;

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:11.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there it says:

01:20:11.952 --> 01:20:16.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep testing whether you are in the faith;

01:20:16.207 --> 01:20:20.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“keep proving what you yourselves are.

01:20:20.169 --> 01:20:24.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or do you not recognize
that Jesus Christ is in union with you?

01:20:24.882 --> 01:20:27.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unless you are disapproved.”

01:20:27.843 --> 01:20:31.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice right in the beginning
of that verse, it says

01:20:31.222 --> 01:20:35.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “keep testing” and “keep proving.”

01:20:35.309 --> 01:20:37.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that really mean?

01:20:37.645 --> 01:20:41.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at the study note
associated with verse 5,

01:20:41.774 --> 01:20:43.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us this:

01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:48.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One lexicon states that the word
Paul here uses for ‘testing’

01:20:48.864 --> 01:20:51.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“means ‘to endeavor to discover

01:20:51.826 --> 01:20:55.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the nature or character of someth[ing].’

01:20:55.413 --> 01:20:59.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They could discover the nature
of their own spiritual standing

01:20:59.041 --> 01:21:03.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by comparing their daily conduct,
attitudes, and decisions

01:21:03.587 --> 01:21:07.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the sacred truths they were taught.

01:21:07.091 --> 01:21:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Doing such testing would help them

01:21:09.552 --> 01:21:13.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to keep proving
that they were true Christians.

01:21:13.431 --> 01:21:16.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For ‘proving,’ Paul uses a word

01:21:16.517 --> 01:21:20.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that could refer to testing
whether something is genuine,

01:21:20.271 --> 01:21:23.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one might test metals.”

01:21:23.482 --> 01:21:27.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see the point
of what this verse tells us?

01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Christians,
we need to ‘keep testing continually

01:21:32.074 --> 01:21:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re in the faith.’

01:21:34.201 --> 01:21:38.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what does this word “faith” mean
in this context?

01:21:38.289 --> 01:21:42.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just referring
to the quality of faith

01:21:42.376 --> 01:21:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, it involves
all the Christian teachings

01:21:46.756 --> 01:21:50.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we find in God’s Word, the Bible.

01:21:50.217 --> 01:21:55.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having that in mind,
“keep testing” and “keep proving” really mean

01:21:55.139 --> 01:21:57.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to look at ourselves

01:21:57.641 --> 01:22:00.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if we’re really living up

01:22:00.102 --> 01:22:02.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what the Bible tells us to do.

01:22:02.938 --> 01:22:06.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a very serious
maintenance program.

01:22:07.067 --> 01:22:10.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just as we do a maintenance program
for a vehicle

01:22:10.988 --> 01:22:13.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we might have a checklist,

01:22:13.532 --> 01:22:15.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there a checklist that we can use

01:22:15.701 --> 01:22:19.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re testing and proving
that we’re in the faith?

01:22:19.955 --> 01:22:21.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there is.

01:22:21.373 --> 01:22:23.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say there are three things.

01:22:23.834 --> 01:22:27.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, we need to ask

01:22:27.004 --> 01:22:31.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heart-searching questions
about our relationship with Jehovah.

01:22:31.926 --> 01:22:33.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the first point:

01:22:33.677 --> 01:22:37.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask the questions
that will search through our heart.

01:22:37.765 --> 01:22:42.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we have to answer honestly.

01:22:42.603 --> 01:22:46.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, whatever we see
as an answer to those questions,

01:22:46.065 --> 01:22:48.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to have a correct answer.

01:22:49.693 --> 01:22:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, finally,
we need to seek Jehovah’s help

01:22:53.823 --> 01:22:56.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making whatever adjustments
we need to make

01:22:56.867 --> 01:23:00.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can maintain our spirituality

01:23:00.246 --> 01:23:02.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strong and in good standing

01:23:02.915 --> 01:23:06.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that our relationship
with Jehovah is good.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:12.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that in mind, let’s go back
to the illustration we started with

01:23:12.925 --> 01:23:15.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a vehicle, a car, or a motorbike.

01:23:16.846 --> 01:23:19.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were to compare

01:23:19.306 --> 01:23:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Christian faith or our beliefs
or our conduct

01:23:23.686 --> 01:23:27.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a vehicle and the need to maintain it,

01:23:27.147 --> 01:23:30.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sort of things would you make
as a comparison?

01:23:30.901 --> 01:23:35.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps the first thing
we might think about is the engine.

01:23:35.072 --> 01:23:38.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You certainly need to make sure
the engine works correctly

01:23:38.742 --> 01:23:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s what gives the vehicle
the power to keep moving.

01:23:43.455 --> 01:23:46.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good for us to ask the question,

01:23:46.584 --> 01:23:51.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it that moves us or motivates us

01:23:51.255 --> 01:23:54.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we serve Jehovah acceptably?

01:23:54.592 --> 01:23:56.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer is found in the Scriptures.

01:23:56.927 --> 01:24:01.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we turn together
to the first book of Timothy

01:24:01.098 --> 01:24:03.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 4 and verse 8

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:10.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s 1 Timothy 4:8—

01:24:10.065 --> 01:24:14.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see if you can discern
what it is that we could liken

01:24:14.695 --> 01:24:17.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the engine in a car.

01:24:17.364 --> 01:24:19.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us:

01:24:19.366 --> 01:24:24.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For physical training
is beneficial for a little,

01:24:24.204 --> 01:24:29.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but godly devotion
is beneficial for all things,

01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:32.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as it holds promise of the life now

01:24:32.338 --> 01:24:34.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the life that is to come.”

01:24:35.549 --> 01:24:39.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see what the scripture tells us
is so important?

01:24:39.762 --> 01:24:42.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly devotion.

01:24:42.598 --> 01:24:46.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we need to understand
what godly devotion is.

01:24:46.185 --> 01:24:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we also need to appreciate

01:24:48.812 --> 01:24:53.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this beautiful expression
in the <i>New World Translation.</i>

01:24:53.192 --> 01:24:56.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many other Bibles just simply translate this

01:24:56.654 --> 01:25:01.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “godliness”—“godliness is beneficial.”

01:25:01.408 --> 01:25:05.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps they say “godly training”

01:25:05.412 --> 01:25:07.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “being religious,”

01:25:07.581 --> 01:25:11.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even one version says “mental training.”

01:25:11.919 --> 01:25:14.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the <i>New World Translation</i>  captures

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the meaning of the original word here,

01:25:17.508 --> 01:25:21.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you can train, or program, a robot

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:23.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do a certain job,

01:25:23.764 --> 01:25:27.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you can’t program it
to have godly devotion.

01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:29.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

01:25:29.061 --> 01:25:34.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because godly devotion involves
how we feel about Jehovah.

01:25:34.066 --> 01:25:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means our loyalty to him

01:25:36.485 --> 01:25:41.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on a heart
full of love and appreciation.

01:25:41.281 --> 01:25:44.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it says godly devotion is important,

01:25:44.618 --> 01:25:48.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really involves <i>why</i>  we do things,

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just <i>what</i>  we do.

01:25:52.126 --> 01:25:56.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s think back
to our illustration of the vehicle.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to test the engine.

01:25:59.967 --> 01:26:03.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do to check the engine
to see if it’s OK?

01:26:04.388 --> 01:26:08.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one thing you might do
is keep an eye on the temperature gauge,

01:26:08.559 --> 01:26:13.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if the engine is overheating,
you know there’s a problem.

01:26:13.022 --> 01:26:17.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps you might check the oil
to see if there’s enough oil.

01:26:17.651 --> 01:26:22.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may check to see
if you’ve changed the oil regularly enough.

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when the engine is idling,

01:26:25.534 --> 01:26:28.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might listen carefully to it

01:26:28.162 --> 01:26:31.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if it’s running smoothly or roughly

01:26:31.915 --> 01:26:36.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, you’d be interested
if there are any strange sounds or noises.

01:26:36.837 --> 01:26:40.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the type of thing
you would have on a checklist

01:26:40.424 --> 01:26:44.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re trying to see
if an engine is working properly.

01:26:46.055 --> 01:26:49.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, none of that applies
to godly devotion, does it?

01:26:49.475 --> 01:26:52.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what could be on our checklist

01:26:52.186 --> 01:26:54.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to test godly devotion

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:59.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if it’s healthy and strong or not?

01:26:59.443 --> 01:27:01.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, the Bible helps us.

01:27:01.653 --> 01:27:05.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me
this time to the book of Psalms,

01:27:05.657 --> 01:27:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look at Psalm 40:8

01:27:10.537 --> 01:27:13.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s Psalm 40:8.

01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:20.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it tells us:
“To do your will, O my God,

01:27:20.464 --> 01:27:22.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is my delight,

01:27:22.549 --> 01:27:25.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your law is deep within me.”

01:27:26.804 --> 01:27:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a test of our godly devotion.

01:27:30.974 --> 01:27:32.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

01:27:32.684 --> 01:27:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we need to ask ourselves:

01:27:35.771 --> 01:27:40.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is my service to God
something that I really delight in,

01:27:40.776 --> 01:27:43.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or is it simply a chore?

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is it something that I do as a mere routine

01:27:46.865 --> 01:27:50.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—something that I just
keep on doing regularly

01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:55.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t really have
a strong desire to accomplish?’

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we were thinking

01:27:58.752 --> 01:28:03.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our godly devotion
was not so good, not so strong,

01:28:03.048 --> 01:28:05.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps we were just doing things
out of routine

01:28:05.759 --> 01:28:08.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than for our love for Jehovah,

01:28:08.512 --> 01:28:11.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to take action,

01:28:11.431 --> 01:28:16.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the same as if we heard
that the engine had a knocking sound

01:28:16.436 --> 01:28:19.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we saw that it was overheating.

01:28:19.523 --> 01:28:23.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly
what Jesus told the brothers

01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:27.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back in the first century
in the congregation in Ephesus.

01:28:27.531 --> 01:28:31.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
to the book of Revelation,

01:28:32.035 --> 01:28:34.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation chapter 2.

01:28:35.164 --> 01:28:39.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll remember that this section
of the book of Revelation

01:28:39.209 --> 01:28:44.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a series of messages
that Jesus gives to different congregations.

01:28:44.047 --> 01:28:48.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first congregation mentioned
is in Ephesus.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:51.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at chapter 2 of Revelation

01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:54.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we glance through verses 2 and 3,

01:28:54.725 --> 01:28:56.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you notice?

01:28:56.768 --> 01:28:59.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus says to the brothers:

01:28:59.104 --> 01:29:02.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know your deeds,
and your labor and endurance.”

01:29:02.357 --> 01:29:04.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds good, doesn’t it?

01:29:04.359 --> 01:29:08.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he goes on to say
that they didn’t “tolerate bad men.”

01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:12.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 3,
he mentions that they “persevered”

01:29:12.743 --> 01:29:15.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they “[had] not grown weary.”

01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:19.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we assume from these two verses?

01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:22.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That our brothers back then
in the first century

01:29:22.044 --> 01:29:24.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation in Ephesus

01:29:24.087 --> 01:29:27.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were busy doing the work of Jehovah.

01:29:27.549 --> 01:29:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were active.

01:29:29.885 --> 01:29:32.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t giving up.

01:29:32.137 --> 01:29:35.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then what does Jesus say in verse 4?

01:29:35.807 --> 01:29:39.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless, I hold this against you,

01:29:39.895 --> 01:29:43.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have left the love
you had at first.”

01:29:44.524 --> 01:29:46.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see the point?

01:29:46.902 --> 01:29:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, it shows us that Jehovah and Jesus

01:29:51.114 --> 01:29:55.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not just interested in <i>what</i>  we do

01:29:55.327 --> 01:29:58.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also <i>why </i> we do it.

01:29:58.622 --> 01:30:03.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they want us to serve our God, Jehovah,

01:30:03.627 --> 01:30:07.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that shows that we love him
and that we’re loyal to him,

01:30:07.464 --> 01:30:10.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the same as Jesus loves his Father

01:30:10.217 --> 01:30:12.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is loyal to him.

01:30:12.594 --> 01:30:14.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is so important!

01:30:14.763 --> 01:30:17.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul highlighted this.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:21.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to 1 Corinthians chapter 13,

01:30:22.688 --> 01:30:25.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians chapter 13,

01:30:25.482 --> 01:30:29.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what Paul says under inspiration

01:30:29.236 --> 01:30:31.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 3:

01:30:32.447 --> 01:30:36.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And if I give all my belongings
to feed others,

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:41.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and if I hand over my body
so that I may boast,

01:30:41.164 --> 01:30:44.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but [I] do not have love,

01:30:44.376 --> 01:30:46.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not benefit at all.”

01:30:48.714 --> 01:30:52.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we look across
at the study note on this verse,

01:30:52.759 --> 01:30:54.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice that it says:

01:30:54.928 --> 01:30:57.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Speaking hypothetically,

01:30:57.639 --> 01:31:00.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul says that if instead of love,

01:31:00.434 --> 01:31:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such pride were his motive,

01:31:03.312 --> 01:31:06.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he would give everything he owned
to feed others

01:31:06.606 --> 01:31:10.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or would even die a martyr’s death
as a witness to the truth,

01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:14.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he would not benefit at all.”

01:31:15.574 --> 01:31:17.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that food for thought?

01:31:18.869 --> 01:31:22.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thinking about this expression,
“godly devotion,”

01:31:22.622 --> 01:31:25.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s interesting that one Bible scholar

01:31:25.417 --> 01:31:27.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
defined the original word this way:

01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:32.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that it is
“a very practical awareness of God

01:31:32.549 --> 01:31:35.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every aspect of life.”

01:31:36.053 --> 01:31:40.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we were to check our godly devotion

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:44.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see
that perhaps it’s not really working

01:31:44.728 --> 01:31:46.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as it should,

01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:48.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe it needs maintenance.

01:31:48.899 --> 01:31:52.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What sort of maintenance would we give it?

01:31:52.861 --> 01:31:56.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, surely we would need
to think of Jehovah

01:31:56.073 --> 01:31:58.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more often every day

01:31:58.241 --> 01:32:00.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see him as part of our life.

01:32:01.703 --> 01:32:05.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, meditating on what Jehovah
has done for us

01:32:05.332 --> 01:32:08.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
builds up appreciation and love for him,

01:32:08.835 --> 01:32:10.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that motivates us

01:32:10.837 --> 01:32:14.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what Jehovah wants us to do
out of love,

01:32:14.883 --> 01:32:18.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, a heart full of appreciation.

01:32:18.762 --> 01:32:22.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, offering prayers regularly
to Jehovah

01:32:22.682 --> 01:32:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps to strengthen that relationship.

01:32:26.853 --> 01:32:30.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned so far
in our discussion?

01:32:30.357 --> 01:32:34.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just like the engine of a vehicle
needs to be maintained,

01:32:34.861 --> 01:32:38.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to be aware
of whether or not it’s operating correctly.

01:32:38.865 --> 01:32:42.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way, we need to ask ourselves

01:32:42.202 --> 01:32:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honest questions

01:32:44.287 --> 01:32:47.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—questions that search our hearts

01:32:47.124 --> 01:32:49.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our godly devotion:

01:32:50.544 --> 01:32:53.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is our service to Jehovah

01:32:53.130 --> 01:32:56.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘based simply on routine and a sense of duty?

01:32:56.842 --> 01:32:59.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do we view it just as a chore,

01:32:59.344 --> 01:33:02.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or does our heart show

01:33:02.806 --> 01:33:06.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s filled with appreciation and love
for Jehovah?’

01:33:06.852 --> 01:33:09.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we build up that appreciation
—that love—

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be sure
that our godly devotion is good.

01:33:13.859 --> 01:33:15.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s well maintained.

01:33:16.778 --> 01:33:20.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first point of comparison
that we’d like to make

01:33:20.657 --> 01:33:24.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the maintenance schedule for a vehicle

01:33:24.202 --> 01:33:26.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for our spirituality.

01:33:26.997 --> 01:33:29.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s think of another comparison.

01:33:29.583 --> 01:33:32.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another very important part of any vehicle

01:33:32.711 --> 01:33:35.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the brakes.

01:33:35.297 --> 01:33:37.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we think of the brakes,

01:33:37.299 --> 01:33:39.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re absolutely necessary
—aren’t they?—

01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:42.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because someone could jump
in front of your vehicle.

01:33:42.929 --> 01:33:47.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There could be someone
who perhaps is coming too quickly,

01:33:47.559 --> 01:33:49.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have to avoid them,

01:33:49.936 --> 01:33:52.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you need to use those brakes.

01:33:53.356 --> 01:33:56.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think
we could compare the brakes to

01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:59.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our service to Jehovah

01:33:59.905 --> 01:34:02.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our relationship with him?

01:34:02.115 --> 01:34:04.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible gives us a clue.

01:34:04.409 --> 01:34:07.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read Psalm 111,

01:34:07.954 --> 01:34:10.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see the answer to that question.

01:34:10.415 --> 01:34:14.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we turn there to Psalm 111,

01:34:14.169 --> 01:34:17.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see what verse 10 tells us:

01:34:19.382 --> 01:34:24.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah
is the beginning of wisdom.

01:34:24.387 --> 01:34:29.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those observing his orders
show good insight.

01:34:29.226 --> 01:34:31.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His praise endures forever.”

01:34:33.355 --> 01:34:36.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do you see what could be likened

01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the brakes of a vehicle?

01:34:38.568 --> 01:34:41.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it that stops us

01:34:41.196 --> 01:34:44.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from doing something
that displeases Jehovah?

01:34:44.824 --> 01:34:47.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our fear of Jehovah.

01:34:47.702 --> 01:34:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just as you need to maintain
the brakes in a vehicle,

01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:56.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also need to make sure
that our love for Jehovah

01:34:56.002 --> 01:34:58.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our fear of Jehovah

01:34:58.088 --> 01:35:00.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is strong and well maintained.

01:35:00.966 --> 01:35:04.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, we need to think:
‘What do we mean by fear of Jehovah?

01:35:04.719 --> 01:35:06.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do we mean shaking all the time,

01:35:06.805 --> 01:35:09.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worried that he’s going to do
something wrong to us?’

01:35:09.724 --> 01:35:11.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:35:11.309 --> 01:35:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we could liken it to a chef

01:35:13.895 --> 01:35:16.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has a razor-sharp knife.

01:35:16.815 --> 01:35:19.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this knife, when used properly,

01:35:19.276 --> 01:35:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help him to attain
all sorts of wonderful things.

01:35:23.446 --> 01:35:27.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if he misuses it, then he has a problem.

01:35:27.867 --> 01:35:31.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in a similar way, if our relationship
is strong with Jehovah,

01:35:31.913 --> 01:35:35.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no need for us
to be shaking in our boots, as it were.

01:35:35.208 --> 01:35:39.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, we need to remember always
that Jehovah is with us.

01:35:39.754 --> 01:35:42.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so a healthy fear of Jehovah

01:35:42.549 --> 01:35:46.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means that we don’t want
to displease him in any way.

01:35:47.596 --> 01:35:52.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a fear of Jehovah helps us
so that as we’re moving along,

01:35:52.392 --> 01:35:54.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if anything comes our way,

01:35:54.853 --> 01:35:57.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re ready to stop

01:35:57.063 --> 01:36:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we shouldn’t engage in that activity.

01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:05.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s think for a few moments
about the maintenance check for the brakes.

01:36:06.364 --> 01:36:07.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do?

01:36:07.699 --> 01:36:10.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you check
if the brakes are OK or not?

01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:12.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, mechanics tell us

01:36:12.912 --> 01:36:15.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if you’re applying pressure
to the brakes

01:36:15.498 --> 01:36:18.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you find the steering wheel
is starting to shake,

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s a sign that maybe they need attention.

01:36:21.963 --> 01:36:25.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if you apply pressure to the brakes

01:36:25.592 --> 01:36:29.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the vehicle starts to veer off
to one side,

01:36:29.471 --> 01:36:32.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, it’s not a good sign.

01:36:32.557 --> 01:36:35.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or as you press the brake pedal,

01:36:35.894 --> 01:36:40.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you find there’s very little resistance
and you have to start pumping it,

01:36:40.106 --> 01:36:42.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, that’s a problem.

01:36:42.984 --> 01:36:45.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, like with the engine,

01:36:45.195 --> 01:36:49.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you start to hear
strange, grinding noises,

01:36:49.115 --> 01:36:51.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is never a good sign, is it?

01:36:52.577 --> 01:36:56.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about our fear of Jehovah?

01:36:56.373 --> 01:36:59.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we test whether or not

01:36:59.626 --> 01:37:02.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fear of Jehovah is at the right level?

01:37:04.005 --> 01:37:06.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know that Satan and his world

01:37:06.383 --> 01:37:08.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constantly throw things at us:

01:37:08.843 --> 01:37:12.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
temptations, wrong thinking, and so on.

01:37:12.806 --> 01:37:15.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just like when you’re driving
in a vehicle

01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:19.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and someone jumps out in front of you
or an animal runs across the road

01:37:19.604 --> 01:37:22.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s when we need those brakes.

01:37:22.691 --> 01:37:25.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do we apply them?

01:37:25.944 --> 01:37:29.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does our godly fear help us?

01:37:29.197 --> 01:37:32.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s turn to the book of 2 Corinthians

01:37:32.784 --> 01:37:35.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see a very interesting point

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is mentioned to the brothers
back there in Corinth.

01:37:38.665 --> 01:37:41.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So 2 Corinthians chapter 10

01:37:41.876 --> 01:37:44.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to look at verse 5.

01:37:45.422 --> 01:37:47.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the context of this chapter

01:37:47.674 --> 01:37:51.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is where Paul is talking
about wrong teachings.

01:37:51.553 --> 01:37:55.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the principle as outlined in this verse

01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:57.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be applied also to our reaction

01:37:57.892 --> 01:38:01.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wrong thoughts and immoral thoughts

01:38:01.062 --> 01:38:06.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or all sorts of things
that are not in harmony with Jehovah’s will.

01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s see if we can see
what the principle is,

01:38:08.945 --> 01:38:12.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians 10:5:

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we are overturning reasonings

01:38:16.786 --> 01:38:21.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God,

01:38:21.249 --> 01:38:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we are bringing every thought
into captivity

01:38:25.962 --> 01:38:28.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it obedient to the Christ.”

01:38:30.008 --> 01:38:32.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do we see the point?

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what sort of thought it is

01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:37.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if it’s an immoral thought,

01:38:37.432 --> 01:38:40.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a temptation to do something wrong,

01:38:40.018 --> 01:38:44.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that’s not neutral
with regard to the political situation—

01:38:44.522 --> 01:38:46.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what does it say here?

01:38:46.024 --> 01:38:48.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to react quickly.

01:38:48.026 --> 01:38:51.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just as if we put on the brakes.

01:38:51.571 --> 01:38:55.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have to overturn
all these sort of things

01:38:55.450 --> 01:38:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be going on in our mind.

01:38:57.827 --> 01:39:00.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously, it’s important for us

01:39:00.497 --> 01:39:04.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to test our godly fear
in the sense of thinking:

01:39:04.459 --> 01:39:07.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I normally react

01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:10.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if I’m faced with a situation
that perhaps tempts me?

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I quick to react?

01:39:12.634 --> 01:39:15.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do the brakes work properly,

01:39:15.512 --> 01:39:19.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is my godly fear compromised?’

01:39:19.265 --> 01:39:21.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an interesting question.

01:39:21.976 --> 01:39:26.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, another illustration:
Just imagine that in your car

01:39:26.564 --> 01:39:30.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you find a whole lot of poisonous spiders.

01:39:30.485 --> 01:39:32.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not good, is it?

01:39:32.779 --> 01:39:36.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, you’d get someone
to help you get rid of those spiders.

01:39:36.699 --> 01:39:39.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after you’ve paid that person
to do the job,

01:39:39.577 --> 01:39:42.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would you feel if they said:
“Well, we got most of them.

01:39:42.497 --> 01:39:44.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There could be one or two left”?

01:39:44.582 --> 01:39:46.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think you’d be very happy
—would you?—

01:39:46.918 --> 01:39:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you want
all of those poisonous spiders

01:39:49.712 --> 01:39:51.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the car.

01:39:51.714 --> 01:39:55.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it tell us here in verse 5?

01:39:55.009 --> 01:39:57.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that we have to get

01:39:57.804 --> 01:40:01.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the things that are out of harmony
with Jehovah

01:40:01.641 --> 01:40:03.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under control.

01:40:03.643 --> 01:40:06.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we could find that even though

01:40:06.646 --> 01:40:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of the things are under control,

01:40:09.566 --> 01:40:12.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there could be just a few areas

01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:15.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we haven’t gotten them under control.

01:40:15.238 --> 01:40:17.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could even be that it’s

01:40:17.282 --> 01:40:20.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if we’re going in the wrong direction.

01:40:20.451 --> 01:40:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do you need to do if you find out

01:40:23.079 --> 01:40:26.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re driving on the highway
in the wrong direction?

01:40:26.499 --> 01:40:30.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, turn around,
and go the opposite direction.

01:40:30.587 --> 01:40:33.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So isn’t that exactly what we should do

01:40:33.423 --> 01:40:38.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to this matter
of checking our godly fear?

01:40:38.094 --> 01:40:40.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we see that in any way

01:40:40.722 --> 01:40:43.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re a little slow in reacting

01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:47.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when immoral temptations come our way
or other wrong thinking,

01:40:47.729 --> 01:40:51.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to strengthen
our fear of Jehovah.

01:40:51.357 --> 01:40:56.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our fear of Jehovah
helps us to resist these things.

01:40:56.279 --> 01:41:01.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s something that can help
to strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

01:41:01.159 --> 01:41:04.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, the Bible
gives us an indication.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, we find it
in the book of Proverbs,

01:41:08.541 --> 01:41:12.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 8:13.

01:41:12.754 --> 01:41:17.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll notice that this is
a little definition, or formula, for us.

01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:21.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 8:13:

01:41:23.389 --> 01:41:25.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah

01:41:25.892 --> 01:41:29.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means the hating of bad.”

01:41:30.355 --> 01:41:34.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is it that can help us
strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to hate what is bad.

01:41:38.071 --> 01:41:41.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for a moment,
let me ask you this question:

01:41:41.282 --> 01:41:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there some type of food
that you really hate?

01:41:45.161 --> 01:41:49.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I can think of a couple of things
that I just really can’t eat,

01:41:49.874 --> 01:41:51.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I hate them.

01:41:53.127 --> 01:41:56.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone tries to tempt you
to eat that food,

01:41:56.381 --> 01:41:58.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you going to give in easily?

01:41:58.424 --> 01:42:02.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not, because you hate
that type of food.

01:42:02.387 --> 01:42:05.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how much more important it is for us

01:42:05.223 --> 01:42:08.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop within ourselves a hatred

01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:10.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what is bad.

01:42:10.353 --> 01:42:12.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have to make sure

01:42:12.021 --> 01:42:15.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we see things that Jehovah hates,

01:42:15.775 --> 01:42:19.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we feel the same way
—that we don’t accept them.

01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:22.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never would we allow gradualism

01:42:22.365 --> 01:42:24.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to change our feelings

01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:28.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to what Jehovah says is wrong.

01:42:28.955 --> 01:42:33.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we read on,
looking back at Proverbs 8:13,

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice it says: “The fear of Jehovah
means the hating of bad.”

01:42:37.964 --> 01:42:42.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it says:
“I hate self-exaltation and pride

01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:48.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the evil way and perverse speech.”

01:42:48.182 --> 01:42:52.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to make sure
that we take out of our hearts

01:42:52.937 --> 01:42:55.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any sort of pride

01:42:55.356 --> 01:42:59.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could interfere
with our relationship with Jehovah.

01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:04.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very important,
and that’s part of hating what Jehovah hates.

01:43:04.615 --> 01:43:08.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think for a moment:
As we’re doing this checklist

01:43:08.202 --> 01:43:12.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how our fear of Jehovah is
—is it strong or weak?—

01:43:12.999 --> 01:43:15.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to think:

01:43:15.001 --> 01:43:19.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What things do I really feel proud about?’

01:43:19.255 --> 01:43:22.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there something deep inside you
that you feel,

01:43:22.383 --> 01:43:27.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Mmm, yes, I feel really proud about this’?

01:43:27.138 --> 01:43:31.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, never forget David’s son Absalom.

01:43:31.893 --> 01:43:34.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was proud about his hair.

01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:37.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the end, it was his hair
that caused him the problem,

01:43:37.982 --> 01:43:42.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he ended up dying because of his hair
being caught in the branches.

01:43:42.945 --> 01:43:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never would we want to be like Absalom

01:43:46.282 --> 01:43:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow the thing that we are proud of

01:43:49.118 --> 01:43:52.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to actually cause us a serious problem.

01:43:53.372 --> 01:43:55.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s been interesting
—hasn’t it?—

01:43:55.541 --> 01:43:58.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking at a second comparison

01:43:58.002 --> 01:44:00.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the maintenance of a car

01:44:00.755 --> 01:44:04.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the maintenance of our godly fear.

01:44:04.592 --> 01:44:06.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like the brakes,

01:44:06.928 --> 01:44:10.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
godly fear can help us to stop

01:44:10.014 --> 01:44:13.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we do something
that would displease Jehovah.

01:44:14.727 --> 01:44:17.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, when we’re thinking
of this matter

01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of comparing the maintenance of a vehicle

01:44:20.650 --> 01:44:23.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the maintenance of our spirituality,

01:44:23.194 --> 01:44:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are so many different comparisons
that we could make.

01:44:27.657 --> 01:44:30.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your mind is
probably already going there thinking,

01:44:30.576 --> 01:44:33.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, will we make this comparison
or that one?’

01:44:33.913 --> 01:44:36.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we only have time
for one more comparison.

01:44:36.958 --> 01:44:40.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you probably won’t think of the one
that we’re going to talk about

01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:43.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, the horn.

01:44:43.965 --> 01:44:47.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in some parts of the world,
drivers say

01:44:47.176 --> 01:44:50.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the horn is just as important
as the brakes.

01:44:50.429 --> 01:44:51.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:44:51.681 --> 01:44:55.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they need to let people know
they’re driving along the road.

01:44:55.726 --> 01:44:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be that someone is beside them

01:44:58.187 --> 01:45:01.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re about to change lanes
and crash into them.

01:45:01.065 --> 01:45:02.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the horn can help.

01:45:02.859 --> 01:45:06.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or it could be that someone is distracted
and they’re crossing the road.

01:45:06.988 --> 01:45:09.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the horn will help.

01:45:09.574 --> 01:45:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a horn used correctly

01:45:12.535 --> 01:45:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can save lives.

01:45:14.871 --> 01:45:17.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think
we’re going to compare the horn to

01:45:17.915 --> 01:45:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our spiritual activities?

01:45:21.544 --> 01:45:25.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we read 1 Timothy together,

01:45:25.089 --> 01:45:29.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Timothy 4:16,

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see what the comparison is.

01:45:33.222 --> 01:45:37.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 4:16:

01:45:38.769 --> 01:45:43.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay constant attention to yourself
and to your teaching.

01:45:43.149 --> 01:45:46.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Persevere in these things, for by doing this

01:45:46.944 --> 01:45:51.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will save both yourself
and those who listen to you.”

01:45:52.241 --> 01:45:54.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we could say

01:45:54.243 --> 01:45:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just as a horn is important
with regard to a vehicle,

01:45:58.706 --> 01:46:03.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likewise our sounding out the message
of the good news

01:46:03.711 --> 01:46:08.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our teaching others and telling them
about the nearness of Jehovah’s day—

01:46:08.716 --> 01:46:12.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can result in lives being saved.

01:46:13.179 --> 01:46:16.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, if you were to check a horn,

01:46:16.015 --> 01:46:20.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you be looking for
or perhaps more importantly listening to?

01:46:20.686 --> 01:46:24.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for a start, you’d try
to test the horn and honk it.

01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:28.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if no sound comes out,
you know you have a problem.

01:46:28.486 --> 01:46:31.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, on the other hand,
if the sound is too soft

01:46:31.989 --> 01:46:34.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nobody can hear it,

01:46:34.116 --> 01:46:36.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that likewise is a problem.

01:46:37.203 --> 01:46:39.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what about us?

01:46:39.497 --> 01:46:41.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we need to think

01:46:41.582 --> 01:46:44.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our proclamation
of “the good news” is?

01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:45.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

01:46:45.962 --> 01:46:51.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take not just the normal activities
we’re involved with with our preaching work,

01:46:51.092 --> 01:46:53.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what about informal witnessing?

01:46:53.386 --> 01:46:55.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the opportunity?

01:46:55.429 --> 01:46:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think,
‘Yes, I need to talk to this person,’

01:46:58.641 --> 01:47:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and

01:47:00.476 --> 01:47:02.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing happens.

01:47:02.645 --> 01:47:06.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The horn is not working in a symbolic sense.

01:47:06.565 --> 01:47:10.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps we do have the opportunity
and we take it,

01:47:10.403 --> 01:47:13.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the message is not clear.

01:47:13.698 --> 01:47:17.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So persons don’t really understand
what we’re saying.

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if either of those were the case,

01:47:21.414 --> 01:47:24.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d need to see that maintenance is required

01:47:24.667 --> 01:47:27.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to this symbolic horn.

01:47:27.628 --> 01:47:29.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would we do?

01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:32.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it could involve praying to Jehovah

01:47:32.383 --> 01:47:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for courage
—yes, boldness—

01:47:34.844 --> 01:47:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to witness to others,

01:47:36.846 --> 01:47:40.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s informally,
telephone witnessing,

01:47:40.057 --> 01:47:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other forms of witnessing.

01:47:42.518 --> 01:47:46.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then if we’re not so clear, or coherent,

01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:49.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to how we present the message,

01:47:49.442 --> 01:47:52.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how important it is for us
to practice ahead of time,

01:47:52.903 --> 01:47:56.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have special sessions
where we practice what we’ll say!

01:47:56.657 --> 01:48:00.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in this way, we can be ready
to give a clear message

01:48:00.745 --> 01:48:02.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who listen.

01:48:03.706 --> 01:48:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s been
a very interesting exercise, hasn’t it?

01:48:07.043 --> 01:48:08.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we see?

01:48:08.794 --> 01:48:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re using this comparison,
this illustration, of a vehicle,

01:48:12.715 --> 01:48:15.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could say that the engine of a vehicle

01:48:15.468 --> 01:48:18.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like our godly devotion.

01:48:18.679 --> 01:48:22.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our devotion to Jehovah
needs to come from our hearts.

01:48:22.516 --> 01:48:24.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brakes of a vehicle

01:48:24.518 --> 01:48:27.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could liken to our fear of Jehovah.

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:30.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we hate what is bad
the same as Jehovah does,

01:48:30.983 --> 01:48:34.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will stop us, just like brakes do.

01:48:34.236 --> 01:48:38.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then finally, we discussed this matter
of having a horn

01:48:38.824 --> 01:48:40.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sounds the message properly.

01:48:40.826 --> 01:48:44.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to make sure
that we ask for Jehovah’s help

01:48:44.205 --> 01:48:47.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain our witnessing in such a way

01:48:47.625 --> 01:48:52.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can clearly help others
to hear the message.

01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:55.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we’ve gone through this,
I’m sure (as we’ve already mentioned)

01:48:55.341 --> 01:48:58.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can think of many other comparisons.

01:48:58.344 --> 01:49:00.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is

01:49:00.513 --> 01:49:03.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a wise driver

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not just drive his car

01:49:06.685 --> 01:49:10.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or motorbike or whatever vehicle it is.

01:49:10.606 --> 01:49:14.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wise driver also checks to make sure

01:49:14.777 --> 01:49:17.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the vehicle is safe to use.

01:49:17.822 --> 01:49:20.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So likewise for us,

01:49:20.032 --> 01:49:23.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as 2 Corinthians 13:5 says,

01:49:23.285 --> 01:49:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to “keep testing.”

01:49:26.122 --> 01:49:29.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to “keep proving”
that we are in the faith.

01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:34.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, keep checking
that we really are Christians,

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are really living up
to what we believe

01:49:37.425 --> 01:49:40.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we teach others to do.

01:49:40.219 --> 01:49:44.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, what is it
that can be a problem for us?

01:49:44.682 --> 01:49:47.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, if we turn
to the book of Corinthians,

01:49:47.309 --> 01:49:50.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time 1 Corinthians

01:49:50.062 --> 01:49:53.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 10 and verse 12,

01:49:53.357 --> 01:49:55.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see what the problem can be.

01:49:56.902 --> 01:50:01.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 1 Corinthians 10:12:

01:50:02.408 --> 01:50:05.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the one who thinks he is standing

01:50:05.703 --> 01:50:08.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

01:50:09.081 --> 01:50:13.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, just thinking everything is OK
(there are no problems)

01:50:13.878 --> 01:50:16.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thinking that we’re just going on fine

01:50:16.922 --> 01:50:21.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without testing ourselves
and proving that we’re in the truth

01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:23.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that can be a problem,

01:50:23.596 --> 01:50:26.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like lack of maintenance to a vehicle

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:30.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can result in not only damage
with regard to the vehicle

01:50:30.728 --> 01:50:33.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also loss of life.

01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:38.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important then it is
that we continue to keep testing

01:50:38.152 --> 01:50:42.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether or not we are in the faith,
or in the truth!

01:50:42.907 --> 01:50:46.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we do these tests regularly

01:50:46.035 --> 01:50:49.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we check to see:
How is our godly devotion going?

01:50:49.205 --> 01:50:53.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is our fear of Jehovah?
our hatred for what is bad?

01:50:53.167 --> 01:50:56.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is our sounding out of the message going?

01:50:56.086 --> 01:50:59.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we see some weaknesses,

01:50:59.673 --> 01:51:01.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we need to do?

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:06.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our final scripture
takes us back to our theme scripture.

01:51:06.388 --> 01:51:11.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, that was 2 Corinthians 13:5,

01:51:11.477 --> 01:51:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:
“Keep testing . . . keep proving

01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:18.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you yourselves are.”

01:51:19.485 --> 01:51:24.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then if we look down a little further
to verse 11,

01:51:24.406 --> 01:51:27.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll notice what it tells us
that we need to do

01:51:27.535 --> 01:51:30.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we see some problems.

01:51:30.538 --> 01:51:33.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 11, it tells us:

01:51:33.457 --> 01:51:38.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice,

01:51:38.087 --> 01:51:40.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be readjusted.”

01:51:41.799 --> 01:51:45.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does it mean “to be readjusted”?

01:51:45.219 --> 01:51:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at verse 9,

01:51:47.221 --> 01:51:49.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see the same expression is used there

01:51:49.682 --> 01:51:51.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of verse 9.

01:51:51.684 --> 01:51:55.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the study note to that verse
tells us this:

01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:57.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says the word is “used to describe

01:51:57.898 --> 01:52:02.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the restoring of something
to a proper condition.

01:52:02.027 --> 01:52:04.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For instance, at Mt 4:21,

01:52:04.822 --> 01:52:08.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the [word] . . . is used to describe
‘mending’ nets.”

01:52:08.284 --> 01:52:11.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So nets that are damaged
or have holes in them

01:52:11.370 --> 01:52:14.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mending them is just like readjusting them.

01:52:14.748 --> 01:52:18.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Galatians 6:1, the same verb is used

01:52:18.210 --> 01:52:20.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the need to spiritually readjust

01:52:20.504 --> 01:52:24.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fellow believer who has taken a false step.

01:52:24.341 --> 01:52:27.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The term is sometimes used in medical text

01:52:27.761 --> 01:52:32.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to describe the setting of a bone,
a limb, or a joint.

01:52:33.058 --> 01:52:35.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

01:52:35.269 --> 01:52:38.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do this checklist
—go through it—

01:52:38.063 --> 01:52:40.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see that somehow

01:52:40.190 --> 01:52:44.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our godly devotion is not as strong
as it should be

01:52:44.278 --> 01:52:46.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are just doing things out of routine

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our love for Jehovah is no longer strong,

01:52:49.241 --> 01:52:51.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we find that our fear of Jehovah

01:52:51.452 --> 01:52:55.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not stopping us from doing what is wrong,

01:52:55.247 --> 01:52:57.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we are finding that we just are not

01:52:57.750 --> 01:53:01.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thoroughly bearing witness to the good news,

01:53:01.003 --> 01:53:03.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to take action.

01:53:03.088 --> 01:53:05.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it involve?

01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:06.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as it says here,

01:53:06.842 --> 01:53:09.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first of all, identifying what the problem is

01:53:09.845 --> 01:53:13.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then readjusting, repairing,

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:17.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (in some places) replacing activities.

01:53:17.019 --> 01:53:20.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers and sisters,
let’s always remember

01:53:20.522 --> 01:53:23.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter how long
we’ve been in the truth,

01:53:23.317 --> 01:53:25.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what privileges we have,

01:53:25.903 --> 01:53:29.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to keep looking at that checklist.

01:53:29.031 --> 01:53:32.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to “keep testing” and “proving”

01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:35.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we <i>are</i>  in the faith.

01:53:37.206 --> 01:53:40.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Jackson,
for helping us to examine our motives

01:53:40.834 --> 01:53:43.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

01:53:44.963 --> 01:53:48.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we have discussed
what genuine faith is,

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:52.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have considered evidence
that provides a basis for faith.

01:53:52.721 --> 01:53:57.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we look forward to
on the next segment of the program?

01:53:57.434 --> 01:53:59.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture theme will be,

01:53:59.436 --> 01:54:03.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith.”

01:54:03.190 --> 01:54:06.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how to put our faith into action

01:54:06.568 --> 01:54:09.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to resist things
that could weaken our faith.

01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:12.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see examples of brothers and sisters
around the earth

01:54:12.825 --> 01:54:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are putting up
“a hard fight for the faith.”

01:54:16.745 --> 01:54:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our closing song is number 119, entitled

01:54:21.083 --> 01:54:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Must Have Faith.”

01:54:23.210 --> 01:54:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing song number 119,

01:54:25.796 --> 01:54:29.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after the song, you may have
your own closing prayer.

After the Passover of 32 C.E.,

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:06.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus and his disciples were
in Phoenicia of Syria,

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
north of the borders of Israel.

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in this non-Israelite territory,
Jesus couldn’t escape notice.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 15

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and you may want to put
a place marker there—

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 15, starting in verse 22.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Greek woman born in Phoenicia

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found Jesus and begged him
to heal her daughter.

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse says that the girl was
“cruelly demon possessed.”

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 23 says that Jesus did not say
a word in answer to the mother.

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, his disciples urged him:

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Send her away,
because she keeps crying out after us.”

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mother was persistent.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In response, Jesus explained his reason

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:55.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for ignoring her in verse 24:

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was not sent to anyone
except to the lost sheep

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the house of Israel.”

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would the woman respond?

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Jesus’ seeming rejection
discourage her?

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would she lose faith?

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, look for evidence

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Phoenician woman’s
extraordinary faith.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I was not Jewish,

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I saw that this Jesus
was no ordinary man.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard about his power to help others,

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my daughter was suffering.

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t take no for an answer.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was from God.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was nowhere else to turn.

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had faith in Jesus.

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he heard me, he said:

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let it happen to you as you wish.”

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it did!

00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My beautiful, precious daughter

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was healthy and smiling again.

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of her faith, the Phoenician woman
overcame the fear of prejudice

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could have prevented her
from approaching Jesus.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, she was of Greek descent;
Jesus was Jewish.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as stated in the video,

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she heard reports of Jesus’ power
to help others

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she realized that this man was from God.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in verse 22, she addressed Jesus

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:28.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “Lord, Son of David.”

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She publicly acknowledged
that Jesus was the promised Messiah.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though at first
he didn’t respond to her

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then explained his reason for doing so,

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she didn’t become discouraged.

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue with the account in verse 25

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the strong faith of this woman:

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the woman came
and did obeisance to him, saying:

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:54.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Lord, help me!’”

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:58.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Jesus must have been moved
by the woman’s heartfelt appeal!

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, though,
Jesus wanted to test her faith.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like a parent who plans to grant
a child’s request

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but doesn’t give an outward sign of that plan

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to test the child’s seriousness,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what Jesus tells her in verse 26:

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:18.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is not right to take the bread
of the children

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and throw it to the little dogs.”

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among the Greeks and Romans,
the dog was often a beloved pet

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lived in its owner’s house
and played with the children.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “little dogs,”
or perhaps a house dog,

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might have reminded the woman
of a warm, endearing picture.

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:42.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By likening the Israelites to children
and non-Jews to little dogs,

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus evidently wanted to indicate
an order of priority.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a household with both children and dogs,

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the children would be fed first.

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:55.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus meant that he couldn’t care
for non-Israelites

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:58.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the expense of deserving Jews.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than take offense, the woman
discerned the point of the illustration

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humbly stated in verse 27:

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, Lord, but really the little dogs do eat

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the crumbs falling from the table
of their masters.”

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful response!

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result
of the woman’s remarkable faith?

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 28:

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus replied to her:

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O woman, great is your faith;

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:30.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let it happen to you as you wish.’

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And her daughter was healed
from that hour on.”

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:39.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The woman’s faith was rewarded
when Jesus healed her daughter.

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an example of strong faith!

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:45.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:49.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how someone who has just started
to have a good relationship with God

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:53.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might need to display strong faith
like that of the Phoenician woman.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought it would happen.

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finally found what I’d been searching for

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a good relationship with God.

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:12.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day,

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a coworker texted an article

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:17.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that claimed to expose Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was tempted to read it,

00:05:27.014 --> 00:05:29.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I thought back

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:33.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to when I first met Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so excited about what they taught me
from the Bible

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that God’s name is Jehovah,

00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom is a real government,
and so much more.

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:58.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I want to learn
about Jehovah’s Witnesses from their enemies?

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:05.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my friends?

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:12.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so much.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw people who really loved one another.

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:34.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a real brotherhood.

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t just the people.

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the truth!

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:13.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t need to learn
about Jehovah’s Witnesses from their enemies.

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had seen for myself

00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:24.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they worship the true God, Jehovah.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:32.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the young man recognized

00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:35.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put faith in Jehovah’s organization?

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:40.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a protection,
so he wasn’t misled by lies from our enemies.

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:44.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith might have reminded you
of the Phoenician woman.

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:47.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, she recognized and put faith

00:07:47.237 --> 00:07:50.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s representative, his Son.

00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:53.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question we need to consider is,

00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:57.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate
the Phoenician woman’s strong faith?

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:03.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like that woman, we need to recognize
Jehovah’s representatives

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and associate with them.

00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:10.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 24:45,
Jesus identified these representatives.

00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:14.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He foretold that in our day he would use
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:18.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide
spiritual “food at the proper time.”

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we have strong faith

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:25.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body is filling that role
of “the faithful and discreet slave”?

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:27.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider three lines of evidence.

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there’s evidence
of holy spirit guiding these brothers.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, holy spirit
has helped the Governing Body

00:08:35.452 --> 00:08:39.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grasp Scriptural truths
not previously understood.

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:41.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers feel as the apostle Paul did,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wrote at 1 Corinthians 2:13:

00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:49.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These things we also speak,
not with words taught by human wisdom,

00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:52.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with those taught by the spirit.”

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:57.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we see evidence
of angelic assistance.

00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:00.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has the immense task

00:09:00.268 --> 00:09:03.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of overseeing an international preaching work

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:06.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involving over eight million evangelizers.

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:10.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The overall growth of the preaching
and disciple-making work,

00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:12.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite fierce opposition in some lands,

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been possible
only with superhuman assistance.

00:09:18.412 --> 00:09:22.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third line of evidence
is reliance on God’s Word.

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:25.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some religions may revise teachings

00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:28.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to appease beliefs and opinions
of their members.

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:31.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our dear brothers of the Governing Body

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:34.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allow their decisions to be guided
by God’s Word,

rather than popular opinion.

We can have strong faith
that Jehovah, through his Son,

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:44.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is directing the Governing Body.

00:09:44.104 --> 00:09:47.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to remain loyal
to these faithful brothers

00:09:47.357 --> 00:09:49.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jehovah’s organization,

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite attempts by opposers
to discredit them.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will be the outcome if we do?

Think back to the example
of the Phoenician woman.

00:09:59.202 --> 00:10:01.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was she rewarded for her strong faith?

00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes—when her beloved daughter was healed.

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:08.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, if you display strong faith

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow the direction
of our Leader, Jesus,

00:10:11.506 --> 00:10:15.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will lead you to everlasting life.

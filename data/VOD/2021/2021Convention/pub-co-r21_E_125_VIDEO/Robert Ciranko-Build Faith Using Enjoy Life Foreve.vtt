00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:05.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say
is your greatest desire in life?

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the psalmist who wrote Psalm 146
had been asked that question,

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he probably would have answered
with the words in the opening verses:

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praise Jah!
Let my whole being praise Jehovah.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will praise Jehovah all my life.”

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it not also our greatest desire
to praise Jehovah forever

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to teach others
how they can worship him along with us?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those sentiments are nicely expressed

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our original song entitled

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All I Can Give.”

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to a reciting of the opening words

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we watch a portion of the music video.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:02.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O heavenly Father,
I want to give all I can give.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My desire is to please you

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love you as long as I live.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll help those who listen

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find in your Word what they need.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To preach and to teach

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:32.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the way I can really succeed.

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I praise you, Jehovah,

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my faith’s getting stronger each day.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll reflect on my dedication.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:55.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll walk in your way.

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be glad that I did not try
to sing those words to you.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is true that our faith
gets stronger each day

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we praise Jehovah.

00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what of those who do not know him
or who lack faith in him?

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we study the Bible with them,

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to help them to find in God’s Word

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they need
to worship Jehovah with strong faith.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we do that?

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, faith is based on evidence.

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to have faith, a person must first acquire

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an accurate knowledge of Bible truth
on which they can build their faith.

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:44.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a good place to start
is with Jesus’ words at John 17:3,

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we know very well.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:48.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In prayer to Jehovah, he said:

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This means everlasting life,

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their coming to know you, the only true God,

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is Jesus saying?

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that to gain everlasting life,

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:06.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people need to develop
a personal relationship with Jehovah,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that requires learning the truth

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about both God and Christ.

00:03:11.962 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that require of us
as Bible teachers?

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three things.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we have to clear up
any confusion in people’s minds

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:25.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the identities of God and Christ.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And two scriptures that we can use

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:32.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Jeremiah 10:10 and Matthew 16:16

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:37.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jeremiah 10:10 and Matthew 16:16.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 10:10 says:

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jehovah is truly God.

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:46.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the living God.”

00:03:46.038 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at Matthew 16:16, it reports:

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Simon Peter answered:

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.’”

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah is the living God,

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus is the Son of the living God.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:04.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could be clearer than that?

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet,
simply acknowledging these basic facts

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:09.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not enough.

00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then second,

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to help Bible students
build strong faith in Jehovah.

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we learned
in the first talk of this convention,

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:23.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having faith involves
coming to know Jehovah

00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a real Person

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—trusting in him and forming
an unbreakable friendship with him.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This involves learning
what Jehovah likes and dislikes

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowing his values and standards.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the student can do what God’s Son said,

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 14:1:

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:46.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exercise faith in God.”

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then Jesus added:

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exercise faith also in me.”

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So third,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to help Bible students

00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build strong faith in Jesus.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What especially do they need
to believe about Jesus?

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can let the apostle Paul answer,

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated at Ephesians 1:7.

00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:12.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 1:7

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:14.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he wrote:

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:17.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By means of him
we have the release by ransom

00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:19.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the blood of that one,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses,

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:26.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the riches
of his undeserved kindness.”

00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:31.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person learns that Jesus
gave his life for him personally,

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then he can begin to exercise faith
in the power of the ransom

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that it is the basis
for forgiveness of one’s sins,

00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:42.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it offers the hope of everlasting life
under Christ’s Kingdom,

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that it is the greatest proof

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:47.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s love for us.

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:51.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to accept the whole truth

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:54.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:57.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, that is not enough,

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:59.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for at Romans 10:10,
the Bible says:

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With the heart one exercises faith.”

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:05.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person must not only believe the truth

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but must also value it,

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:13.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because only then will he be motivated
to act in harmony with the truth.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:16.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise,
he could reject convincing evidence

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:18.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the truthfulness of what he is learning

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue to hold on
to false beliefs and wrong practices.

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:25.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must do all we can

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the student’s heart
as we conduct Bible studies.

00:06:30.744 --> 00:06:34.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, does this seem
like a daunting task for you?

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have been given
a wonderful new tool

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:41.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with which to build heartfelt faith,

and stirring videos

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the teacher
reach the heart of the student

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw out what he truly believes.

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:04.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have the book

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

please open it now to section 1—section 1.

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at the lessons in that section

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that progressively build faith in Jehovah.

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:25.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lesson 4, the student learns
who the only true God is

00:07:25.507 --> 00:07:28.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that his name is Jehovah.

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:30.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 5 builds faith

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:33.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really is
the Author of the Bible.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 6 reveals
that Jehovah is the Creator of the universe

00:07:37.227 --> 00:07:39.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Source of all life.

00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:42.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 7 explains what Jehovah is like,

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is a real person
with many appealing qualities.

00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:50.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And lessons 8 and 9 show how the student

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:53.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can become God’s friend
and draw close to him.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people, however, find it difficult

00:07:56.872 --> 00:08:00.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imagine being friends
with anyone they cannot see,

00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:03.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let alone with God himself.

and in the next video, follow along

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we see how a teacher
uses what is provided in the book

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her students build faith

00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:20.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s desire to be her Friend.

00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:23.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look in, they are starting to consider

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the information under point 6,

00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:29.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:32.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, good.

00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:41.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Has Done So Much For Me”?

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:45.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 14,

00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:47.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that happened in the past

00:08:47.923 --> 00:08:50.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:55.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like everything
that happened in my life

00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was my fault.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning from the Bible that God says

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:03.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will take my right hand,

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:07.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will fortify me,
that he will really help me

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it blew me away!

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She mentioned a Bible passage

00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:24.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah takes our hand.

00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:29.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read that at Isaiah 41:10, 13,

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:32.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please?

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:38.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:41.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:45.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:48.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on to you
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:09:48.692 --> 00:09:51.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 13: “For I, Jehovah your God,

00:09:51.903 --> 00:09:53.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:55.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid.

00:09:55.907 --> 00:09:57.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will help you.’”

00:09:57.325 --> 00:09:58.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Cassie,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to these verses,
what does Jehovah promise to do

00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:02.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of his friends?

00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:04.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help us when we’re down or scared.

00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:06.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:10:06.418 --> 00:10:08.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look a little closer, though.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify . . . ,

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:12.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will help . . . ,

00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:15.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on . . .”

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—does that sound like a Friend who can help

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:21.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a Friend who wants to help?

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:25.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought of God, Jehovah,

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:28.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that.

00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:31.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Jehovah
would make a good Friend?

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:32.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:10:32.444 --> 00:10:33.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:41.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10, Jehovah
stretches out his hand to you.

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:43.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:44.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His right.

00:10:44.664 --> 00:10:49.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 13,
he takes your hand.

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:51.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:53.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My right.

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:54.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, come here.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:00.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is Jehovah

00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:02.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beside you

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:04.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holding your hand?

00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:09.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is he—

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:12.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In front.

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:14.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:16.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his right hand

00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking your right hand.

00:11:18.823 --> 00:11:20.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s facing you

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:23.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pull you up and out.

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:27.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, what has Jehovah
pulled you out of?

00:11:31.378 --> 00:11:33.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:11:34.047 --> 00:11:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um,

00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:41.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hopelessness.

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a direct result
of friendship with Jehovah.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It grows stronger

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:51.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we talk to him.

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that in the next section, OK?

00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:04.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example
of using <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:06.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build faith in Jehovah!

00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:10.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This student, Cassie,
appeared troubled and distressed,

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:12.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the sister who is teaching her

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so compassionate and patient.

00:12:15.338 --> 00:12:19.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice
that the sister did not talk too much?

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:24.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She just effectively used
the video, scripture, and bolded questions

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:26.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw out the student’s feelings

00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:30.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped her to visualize
what Jehovah has promised to do for her.

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:37.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new study book
also progressively builds faith in Jesus.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open to section 2
—section 2—

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look at the lessons in that section

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:47.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that progressively build faith in Jesus.

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:51.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lesson 15,
the student learns who Jesus is

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:54.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why learning about him is so important.

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:57.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 16 outlines what Jesus did on earth

00:12:57.505 --> 00:12:59.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how that affects us.

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:03.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 17 explains what Jesus is like

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:06.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can imitate his fine qualities.

00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:09.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Skip down to lessons 27 and 28,

00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:11.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which show that Jesus’ death

00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves how much Jehovah and Jesus love us.

00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:20.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people, however, do not understand
the ransom sacrifice of Jesus,

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:24.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they do not view it
as God’s personal gift to them.

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:28.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the apostle Paul
believed that with all his heart.

00:13:28.703 --> 00:13:30.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open lesson 27

00:13:30.914 --> 00:13:35.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—lesson 27, entitled
“How Can Jesus’ Death Save Us?”

00:13:35.377 --> 00:13:40.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And go to point 5,
“The ransom is Jehovah’s gift to you.”

00:13:40.382 --> 00:13:42.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice that the read scripture

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:46.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Galatians 2:20

00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:51.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Galatians 2:20, which reads:

00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:54.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am nailed to the stake
along with Christ.

00:13:54.854 --> 00:13:56.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is no longer I who live,

00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:59.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it is Christ who is living
in union with me.

00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:03.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, the life that I now live
in the flesh

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:06.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I live by faith in the Son of God,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who loved <i>me</i>
and handed himself over for <i>me</i>.”

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:14.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words should come to mind

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:17.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when answering
the last review question for this lesson.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:19.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this next video,

00:14:19.921 --> 00:14:24.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how a teacher uses the Explore feature
at the end of the lesson

00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:28.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the heart of his skeptical student.

00:14:28.138 --> 00:14:32.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look in,
they are discussing the last review question.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Gene,

00:14:38.314 --> 00:14:43.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last review question is,
How can Jesus’ death benefit you?

00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:49.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose I should say
that it means forgiveness from my sins,

00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:51.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God is not going to forgive me.

00:14:51.369 --> 00:14:52.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes you feel that way?

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:54.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t feel; I know.

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:57.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made better choices in my business
than I did at home.

00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:00.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

00:15:02.672 --> 00:15:03.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gene,

00:15:03.882 --> 00:15:06.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scroll down to where it says “Explore”

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and click under
“Can Jehovah forgive even serious sins?”

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:12.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, got it.

00:15:12.849 --> 00:15:15.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:16.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:22.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some people have committed gross sins
and wonder

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether God can forgive them.

00:15:24.277 --> 00:15:26.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happily, the Word of God says:

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:29.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us

00:15:29.115 --> 00:15:31.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from <i>all</i>  sin.’

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins

00:15:34.746 --> 00:15:37.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have a proper, repentant attitude.”

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:42.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:46.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:49.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even serious ones—
and he draws us to him.

00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:53.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

00:15:53.598 --> 00:15:55.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s not free.

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:58.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah 1:18?

00:15:58.812 --> 00:15:59.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see it.

00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:01.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read it, please?

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:05.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, now, and let us set matters straight
between us,’ says Jehovah.

00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Though your sins are like scarlet,
they will be made as white as snow;

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:12.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘though they are as red as crimson cloth,

00:16:12.283 --> 00:16:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will become like wool.’”

00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:19.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So forgiveness of our sins is possible

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we “set matters straight.”

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:25.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you, Gene,

00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:27.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think that means?

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:31.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to do what’s right.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m trying.

00:16:33.847 --> 00:16:35.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s good.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also involves how we feel.

00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:39.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should feel sorry.
I am.

00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:42.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s a good sign, Gene.

00:16:42.814 --> 00:16:44.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lastly,

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:48.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let Jehovah help you with the step
that’s the hardest for many of us.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help you forgive yourself.

00:16:57.662 --> 00:16:59.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus died for me.

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:07.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ron, I think I’m going to need
a little more time to process this.

00:17:07.964 --> 00:17:09.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all do.

00:17:10.383 --> 00:17:12.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go ahead and conclude with a prayer,

00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:17.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll specifically ask Jehovah
to strengthen your faith in the ransom

00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:19.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his forgiveness.

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:23.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, when you pray,
you can beg him for the same thing.

00:17:24.397 --> 00:17:25.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:28.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say a prayer.

00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, our heavenly Father . . .

00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:34.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gene needed convincing

00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:38.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus’ sacrifice
benefited him personally.

00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:41.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not convinced of that in his heart,

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:45.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not have the faith needed
to become Jesus’ disciple.

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:48.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother was familiar
with the contents of the Explore section

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and chose to discuss with Gene
the <i>Watchtower</i>  article

00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:53.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could best help him.

00:17:55.303 --> 00:17:58.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times, if needed,
the teacher could give the student homework

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read an article or to watch a video
from the Explore section

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get his observations
at the next study session.

00:18:06.689 --> 00:18:10.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video,
Ron was going to pray specifically

00:18:10.068 --> 00:18:12.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah to strengthen Gene’s faith

00:18:12.153 --> 00:18:14.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ransom
and in God’s forgiveness of him.

00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:17.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an excellent way
to keep helping a student

00:18:17.492 --> 00:18:21.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw close to Jehovah
and build faith in God’s Word!

00:18:22.872 --> 00:18:24.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s spirit produces faith

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only in people whose heart
favors the truth over lies.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us use <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:35.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach the truth to those
with whom we study the Bible

00:18:35.343 --> 00:18:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help build their faith
in Jehovah and Jesus.

00:18:39.389 --> 00:18:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let us pray for Jehovah’s help

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:45.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach their heart.

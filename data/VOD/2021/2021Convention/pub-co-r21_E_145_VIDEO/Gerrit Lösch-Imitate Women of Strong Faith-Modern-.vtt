00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, there were
many sisters with outstanding faith.

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Matsue Ishii was one of them.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was born in Japan in 1909.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although she grew up in a Buddhist family,

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had a thirst for Bible knowledge.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1918, the Spanish flu hit her area

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she saw lots of coffins with dead bodies.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She and her elder sister
both also caught the Spanish flu,

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a week later, her sister died.

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wondered, ‘Why do people die,

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what happens to them at death?’

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:47.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1928, when Matsue was 19,

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her father arranged for her

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to marry Jizo Ishii, a zealous Buddhist.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matsue was introduced to the truth in Osaka

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:01.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the book <i>The Harp of God.</i>

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:06.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was given to her by a brother
who lived in a neighboring house

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that belonged to the International Bible
Students Association.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matsue was baptized in March 1929,

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her husband, Jizo,
was baptized a short time later.

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:23.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In June 1939, when she was 30 years old,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she and her husband were arrested

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were separated from each other.

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This certainly called for faith.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said that she nearly died

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she was in solitary confinement
for almost a year.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matsue was released
toward the end of 1944,

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:50.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was reunited with Jizo
after World War II ended.

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both she and her husband
had remained faithful.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us now consider
another encouraging example.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after World War II ended,
far away from Japan,

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Estonia, northeastern Europe,

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ella Toom was introduced to the truth

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in April 1945

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was baptized in August 1946,

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at age 20.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was arrested by the Communists

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on December 27, 1950,

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to imprisonment.

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was sent
to a slave labor camp in Russia,

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the infamous Vorkuta camp

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
above the Arctic Circle,

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later to other prison camps

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
250 miles, or 400 kilometers,
southeast of Moscow.

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:48.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters continued
to be spiritually-minded.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made miniature copies
of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:56.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put them inside bars of soap
and resealed the soap.

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:59.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This certainly called for faith.

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:01.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did not have to serve for 13 years

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but actually was released on May 4, 1956,

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:09.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after five and a half years.

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year after,
she married Brother Lembit Toom.

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the threat
of searches and arrests continued

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the preaching work
was legalized in Estonia in 1991.

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note some other details

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the lives
of these two faithful women

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matsue Ishii and Ella Toom.

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For nearly a year,

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had been held in solitary confinement

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tiny, filthy, bug-infested prison cell.

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five and a half years after my arrest,

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was released.

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:10.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we truly rely on Jehovah,

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:12.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really love him

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cry out in our heart for his help,

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:18.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he did not forsake me,

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:22.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will not forsake his servants.

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:36.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrested me

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:39.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took me in for questioning.

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An interrogator invited me to sign a document

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stating that I would discontinue preaching.

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:50.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I would rather live in prison

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with my relationship with God intact

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than be free and lose his approval.”

00:04:57.985 --> 00:04:59.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My determination

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been to heed the Bible’s admonition:

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do good.”

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:08.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned that doing this

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leads to receiving

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:13.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the requests of your heart.”

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:24.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Sisters Ishii and Toom show faith?

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 37.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Ishii had faith
that Jehovah would not abandon her,

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:38.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in line with Psalm 37:25,

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which reads:

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was once young and now I am old,

00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:46.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I have not seen
any one righteous abandoned,

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:49.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor his children looking for bread.”

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:53.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her faith helped her

00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:57.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure difficult tests of integrity.

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:02.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was arrested on June 21, 1939,

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:04.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taken to a police station

00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:07.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put into a dark cell

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with soot hanging from the ceiling.

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:13.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, she was transferred
to another location

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:17.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put into solitary confinement.

00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:20.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her husband was also arrested,

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:23.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she did not see him
until the war had ended.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I nearly died in that cell,’ she said.

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:33.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she was exposed to another test too.

00:06:33.038 --> 00:06:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When interrogated,
she found out from the officials

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Junzo Akashi,

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the overseer of the Japan branch,

00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:45.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had abandoned the truth.

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Ishii replied:

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Akashi is only an imperfect human . . .

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:54.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is no longer my brother.”

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:59.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Ishii remained loyal.

00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:02.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, Sister Toom from Estonia

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:07.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refused to compromise
or to abandon her faith.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She prayed and meditated on Bible principles

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:13.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to endure,

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:16.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Psalm 119

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:21.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 97, 98 say:

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:26.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How I do love your law!

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:29.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I ponder over it all day long.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your commandment
makes me wiser than my enemies,

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:37.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is with me forever.”

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1949,

00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:46.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ella Toom was arrested by the Communists.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took her in for questioning.

00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:52.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She reports:
“Forced to remove all my clothing

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:55.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and [being watched]
by young police officers,

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt humiliated.

00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:01.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yet, after I prayed to Jehovah,

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“peace and calmness of heart came over me.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Next, I was put in a tiny cell,

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:12.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where I could not even lie down.

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:16.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was taken out only for interrogations.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The officers would say:

“You can have a promising future.’

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:34.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they would threaten:
‘Do you want to live?

00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do you want to die with your God
on the fields of Siberia?’”

00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:45.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said: “For three days,
I was prevented from falling asleep

00:08:45.003 --> 00:08:48.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“between the repeated interrogations.

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:52.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meditation on Bible principles
helped me to endure.

00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:58.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, an interrogator
invited me to sign a document

“stating that I would discontinue preaching.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“‘and I would rather live in prison
with my relationship with God intact

“than [to] be free and lose his approval.’

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:20.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that the interrogator shouted:

“‘You fool!

All of you will be arrested
and sent to Siberia!’”

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:32.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

In the following dramatization,

00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how a brother shows faith

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:44.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that of Sisters Ishii and Toom.

00:09:55.157 --> 00:09:58.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the world went from bad to worse,

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I dug deeper into God’s Word.

00:10:20.348 --> 00:10:21.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to stay strong,

00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:24.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like so many
brothers and sisters in the past.

00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:30.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who remained faithful
had no special abilities

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:33.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were inconspicuous.

00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Surely all of us
must always trust in Jehovah

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:39.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all our heart.”

00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:44.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I memorized scriptures.

00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:48.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew these words would build my faith

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:55.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give me the strength I needed
to face what was to come.

00:11:16.863 --> 00:11:18.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new wave of arrests occurred this week

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as local authorities enforce new restrictions
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:25.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is coming just 14 days
after the Supreme Court’s ruling . . .

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:42.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;

00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:54.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.

00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:58.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:11:58.196 --> 00:12:01.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:06.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to be more discreet,

00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:09.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never stopped talking
about God’s Word.

00:12:14.421 --> 00:12:17.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to face many difficulties,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with God’s Word embedded in our hearts,

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:23.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we faithfully endured to the end.

with schoolmates, teachers,

00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:21.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unbelieving family members.

00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:27.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can also imitate
the mother of Jesus, Mary.

How?

Strengthen your faith, and trust in Jehovah.

all that God’s Word says
about his wonderful promises.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says:

00:14:05.657 --> 00:14:08.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mary . . . sat down at the feet of the Lord

00:14:08.702 --> 00:14:12.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept listening to what he was saying.”

When we clearly perceive

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:31.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “great cloud of witnesses
surrounding us,”

00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:35.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
